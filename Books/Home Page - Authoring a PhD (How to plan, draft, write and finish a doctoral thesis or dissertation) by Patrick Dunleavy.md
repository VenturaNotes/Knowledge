- Author is [[Patrick Dunleavy]]
- - “Study Guides” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=3&annotation=BZGF77KS))
	- #resource Study guides for books in the future

## Preface
- “All rules for study are summed up in this one: learn only in order to create. - [[Friedrich Schelling]]” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=7&annotation=JUGYXN4V)) 
- #comment the table of comments honestly don't seem that well organized. Sort of difficult to tell when a subsection starts on one line and begins on the next. Most textbooks have many dots like these "..." to better indicate this.
- [[Michael Oakeshott]] ^1zpzb5
	- “A [[university]] is an association of persons, locally situated, engaged in caring for and attending to the whole intellectual capital which composes a civilization.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=11&annotation=HBEXHEQK))
		- #question Is it just "intellectual capital" or is there such a thing as just capital?
		- #question What does capital mean in this case? 
		- #question Is he saying that the university is what composes a civilization or is it just the intellectual capital? 
	- “concerned not merely to keep an intellectual inheritance intact, but to be continuously recovering what has been lost...making more intelligible, reissuing and reinvesting. ,” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=11&annotation=84LKP9PY))
		- #question What does he mean by recovering what has been lost? This quote seems to have a lot of meaning to it but I do wonder what the context is. Maybe it has to do when the library of Alexandria was burnt down so we're just recovering the information that has been lost. Also reminds me of conservatives messing up experiments
		- #question what is intellectual inheritance? 
	- #question what time period did this person grow up in?
	- He has an  “evident antiquarian bias against any genuine or substantive innovation here” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=11&annotation=9PWCDPBP))
		- #question what is antiquarian bias?
		- #question Is he just saying that the statement is too verbose to have any real meaning? 
	- “this ‘mission statement’ is extensive enough.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=11&annotation=5QS7PJGN))
		- #comment This author who is writing a book about how to write a PhD is literally using air-quotes which my high-school teacher says wasn't good.
- “far too large to be credible in the era of a ‘knowledge society’,” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=11&annotation=25Q5N3E2))
	- #comment stating how there are many other people working in professions and companies including independent writers and researchers also attend to the intellectual capital of a civilization 
- “civil society groups” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=11&annotation=KPSHHUGE))
	- #question what is a civil society group? 
- Book is “especially directed to research students and their advisers or supervisors in universities.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=11&annotation=EARQMJ8B))
	- #question what is the difference between an adviser or supervisor? 
	- “they still pursue the most demanding ideal of original research.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=12&annotation=3SEK8Z3Q))
- “‘Nothing was ever yet done that someone was not the first to do,’ said [[John Stuart Mill]]” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=12&annotation=7T46HICB))
- “Each doctoral dissertation or thesis is to a large extent [[sui generis]].” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=12&annotation=3QAU2QKY))
	- #question what does sui generis even mean?
- “students also need to acquire a core of generic authoring skills that are substantially similar across diverse disciplines and topics.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=12&annotation=9T4YGDLD))
- “research skills training has been formalized a great deal in the last two decades” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=12&annotation=G3N8DJMF))
	- #question what are the important research skills that a PhD student actually needs?
	- The craft skills of authoring have been neglected and unsystematized
		- #comment systematizing things is super important!
- Oakeshott was a [[traditionalist]]
	- Author believes his contribution is just a further step towards the bureaucratization of modern society foreseen by [[Max Weber]]
- “There is a long and honourable tradition now of scholarship reflecting upon itself. It stretches back through [[Friedrich Schelling]]’s [[idealist]] vision in "On University Studies", to [[Francis Bacon]]’s musings in "The Advancement of Learning", and before him to some significant reflective writings of the [[medieval thinkers]] and the ancient [[Greek philosophers]].” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=12&annotation=VYK2CMP9))
	- #resource "On University Studies" and "The Advancement of Learning"
- Giving generic advice for completing a doctoral dissertation is not too useful unless it can be covered in a systematic way. 
- PhD students can build on a small amount of 'ready-made knowledge' (as [[Friedrich Schelling|Schelling]] termed it)
	- “picking and choosing those elements of this text that are relevant for their problems” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=13&annotation=3INT2N57))
- “My next biggest debt is to colleagues at the London School of Economics and Political Science who have co-supervised PhDs with me or co-taught the School-wide seminar on PhD writing.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=13&annotation=UIVSRHKE))
- “you will contribute to the book by e-mailing me your comments, criticisms and suggestions for changes or additions.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=14&annotation=ZUGBAVQS))
	- #contact “p.dunleavy@lse.ac.uk” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=14&annotation=BHNGGKK6))
- “the [[doctorate]] still remains a crucial vehicle for developing new and original thought in the humanities and social sciences, especially amongst young people, who (as [[Plato]] said) are ‘closer to ideas’.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=14&annotation=NLC4TIBP))
	- #question why only humanities and social sciences. Why doesn't he talk about stem?
## (1) Becoming an author
- “In writing a problem down or airing it in conversation we let its essential aspects emerge. And by knowing its character, we remove, if not the problem itself, then its secondary, aggravating characteristics: confusion, displacement, surprise. [[Alain de Botton]]” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=16&annotation=DF7RY85K))
- “we can often make progress on the latter by making the issues involved more explicit.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=16&annotation=8IKARIR8))
- “A [[thesis]] or a long dissertation (I use these words interchangeably from here on) forms a critical element in all the main models of PhD education.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=16&annotation=BYA4TAZP))
- “The second section considers the varying authoring tasks involved in the ‘classical’ model of PhD and newer ‘taught PhD’ models.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=17&annotation=J7JE8KDH))
### (1.1) Authoring is more than just writing
- “To write is to raise a claim to be read, but by whom? [[C. Wright Mills]]” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=17&annotation=AJXXZ55N))
- “And acquiring authoring capabilities is very important in finishing a doctorate on time and avoiding the long delays for which [[PhD]] students were once notorious.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=17&annotation=7WWWGPFX))
- “amongst academic staff that at the PhD level becoming an effective writer is completely bound up with becoming a good researcher, and with mastering the subject matter of one individual academic discipline.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=17&annotation=EHRM2UGS))
	- #comment and it's the subsection of that academic discipline which really matters. Getting a PhD in computer science means you'll only be good at a part of that discipline
- “This neglect of [[authoring]] skills is not universal. The editors of academic journals and most publishers of university-level books can and do draw a distinction between people’s prowess in a discipline and their proficiency as writers.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=18&annotation=J86S8HBH))
- “the [[craft approach]] to PhD education still works well, even though it has been extensively supplemented in modern times by much more formalized, extensive and lengthier processes of advanced instruction. ” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 18](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=18&annotation=S82C7WBL))
- “inculcating” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=19&annotation=YRGXDT5X))
	- #question what does this mean?
- “[[by-product approach]] can still deliver outstanding results.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=19&annotation=P2UEIJFG))
	- “by-product model of how students learn and develop is far more problematic in relation to [[authoring skills]].” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=19&annotation=A9NXIJHW))
	- “In modern universities the pressures of teaching, research, publishing and administration on qualified staff frequently cause this model to break down in one or several respects.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=19&annotation=GIQRDYC5))
	- “very time-consuming and erratic,” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=19&annotation=IAQQHJ7Q))
- “I believe that in most of the social sciences and all of the humanities disciplines, a set of general authoring skills determine around 40 to 50 per cent of anyone’s success in completing a doctorate.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=19&annotation=7HD2LKGX))
- “Doing good research and becoming an effective author are not separate processes, but closely related aspects of intellectual development that need to work in parallel.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=20&annotation=VW2UBQPI))
	- “I also believe that authoring skills are relatively generic ones” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=20&annotation=4GBK69ES))

### (1.2) Different models of PhD and the tasks of authoring

| Model of PhD                                                                                                                    | Supervision                                                                   | Thesis requirement                                                                             | Found in                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Classical model]]: Focuses on thesis writing throughout, with only preliminary training or coursework                         | Either one or two supervisors (UK); or a small supervisory committee (Europe) | [[Big book thesis]]: an integrated set of chapters usually around 80,000 to 100,000 words long | British-influenced and European-influenced university systems, and more text-based disciplines |
| [[Taught PhD model]]: The first stage involves coursework assessed by a general examination. The second stage is a dissertation | Main adviser, plus minor advisor, plus rest of dissertation committee         | [[Paper model dissertation]]: four or five publishable quality papers, around 60,000 words     | American-influenced university systems, and more technical social sciences elsewhere           |

- “There are two main types of PhD education: the ‘classical’ model associated closely with a ‘big book’ type of thesis; and the more modern ‘taught PhD model’, normally associated with a shorter ‘papers model dissertation’.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=21&annotation=IJ264TTZ))
- “inculcate” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=21&annotation=WQBCQ6BM))
	- #question meaning?
- Classical model of PhD: “The most traditional version of this approach conforms closely to the ‘sorcerer’s apprentice’ tradition where students come to sit at the feet of an individual supervisor, a great man or woman in their field who long ago wrote a big book.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=21&annotation=2C2WHG2A))
	- Supervisor not concerned with the final thesis which is typically undertaken by two or three people not previously involved with the student's work
	- “However, in many places and disciplines coursework now plays a much more important role even in the classical model of PhD education.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=21&annotation=ALGXACDQ))
		- Becoming a professional author more a matter of sitting in repeated research seminars, interacting with staff members, getting reactions to trial papers, and receiving oral and written comments on draft chapters from the [[supervisory committee]]
	- In European universities, several supervisors are also examiners in its final stages to decide whether the student's final thesis should be accepted as a doctorate.
- “The different versions of the classical doctorate model work fine when everything aligns the right way, but badly if they do not.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=22&annotation=AFNG48MU))
	- Positives
		- Trans of ideas can be fast if supervisor and student get along well
	- Negatives
		- Supervisor may feel threatened by younger rival
		- They can become too close where the student just repeats the supervisor
		- They could fail to connect where student's focus diverges from the supervisor's expertise
		- Busy supervisors could also be distracted by other academic obligations and may be absent on sabbatical or research at crucial times
			- 'fill-in' supervisors are problematic
- “The newer, more collective supervision variant of the classical model is generally more flexible and resilient,” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=22&annotation=RGRAXP87)) ç
	- More common in British or “[[Commonwealth university systems]]” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=22&annotation=4D8IU8N3))
	- There are advantages and disadvantages to having multiple supervisors
		- Positives
			- Students have eggs in several baskets
			- Students less dependent on personal relations with just one person
			- If one member of committee go awry, can be compensated by developing more reliance on most sympathetic supervisor
			- Students better covered for absences by one of their supervisors
		- Negatives
			- “a supervisory committee can cause other problems.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=23&annotation=SWJTMRBY))
			- Students could get conflicting advice from different advisers
			- Students might need to invest personal resources in steering supervisors towards some agreement
			- Since senior people play roles in supervising and examining theses, student may find it harder to handle their relationship with them
- A classical model of PhD “culminates in the production of a ‘big book’ thesis, usually limited to a length of 100,000 words. It must be presented in a conventional book format, with a succession of linked chapters and an integrated overall argument.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=23&annotation=XXZAAUSH))
- “The taught PhD model has two key elements.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=23&annotation=IAMSNS8M))
	- “extensive and demanding programme of coursework usually lasting two or three years and assessed at the end” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=23&annotation=JU9QH3II))
	- “second element is a medium length papers model dissertation undertaken for a further two to four years and assessed by a dissertation committee.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=23&annotation=WEWR4FHC))
	- American PhD committee always includes the student's advisers plus two or three other senior staff wdo do not work closely with the student
	- “The ‘[[main adviser]]’ is the staff member who principally guides a student in completing their dissertation” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=23&annotation=WV8Y7EAP))
	- “The '[[minor adviser]]’ works with the student but less intensively.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=23&annotation=FY8FRTNN))
		- “Some universities stipulate that the minor adviser should not be a specialist in the same area that the student’s dissertation is in.” ([Dunleavy, 2003, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/2I3ANAEH)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SPDJ9NPH?page=23&annotation=KVZXKEEU))
	- Committee members may read the student's work at several stages, but especially when the dissertation is complete, and they conduct the '[[dissertation defence]]' or final oral examination.
