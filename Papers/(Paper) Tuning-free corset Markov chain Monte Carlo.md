## Abstract
- [[Bayesian coreset]]
	- Small, weighted subset of a data set that replaces the full data during inference to reduce computational cost
		- #question What is meant by inference?
		- #question Difference between bayesian coreset and coreset?
		- #question How can we measure computational cost and what is the context? 
- The corset construction algorithm, [[Coreset Markov chain Monte Carlo]], uses draws from an adaptive Markov chain targeting the coreset posterior to train the coreset weights via stochastic gradient optimization
	- #question What is meant by draws?
