## Synthesis

### Current Solution
- Use normal tab view
	- In stacked view, if there is a tab you want to focus on, you'd need to scroll to find the correct one and repositioning them can be difficult
	- In normal tab view, you can view all the tabs at the top (similar to a browser), and you can view items side by side by simply having a left and right pane.
- When using the `Another Quick Switcher` plugin to open a note, hold shift so the equivalent active note is revealed instead of creating a duplicate tab
	- If you want a duplicate tab, do `Command + P` and `Split Right`
### Questions
1. What is the best way to use stacked tabs?
	- I do have a CSS snippet which spreads out the tabs by 700px in width and then I can just simply scroll to see them all
		- I believe normal tab view to still be better though
2. How can I add a dividing line between tabs so I can more easily see which document belongs to which one? 
	- I'm sure there is a CSS snippet for this one but again not worth the time to find
