## Synthesis
### Solution
- Do not use Task Genius
- Use TaskNotes and create subtasks within the notes. However, the description should only be in the parent note. 
	- Finds the parent note more easily which is nice
	- Send those subtasks to the "admin" folder to prevent clog of search results
- Even if a task could have multiple scheduled due dates, this wouldn't fix my problems because sometimes I might want a different title.
### Temporary Solution
- Yes
	- Able to create due dates on the calendar (supposedly) with both tasks and checkboxes and tasks as notes.
		- Although I haven't figured out yet how to make them appear on the calendar. 
		- It would be nice to see what I actually need to do that day rather than just see my daily note for something (but then I guess the event wouldn't be that important anyway.)
- No
	- You might be able to replace "TaskNotes", but then you would need to find a new system again (but not needed as currently they are both in active development)
### Ideas for TaskNotes
- Current problem is not sure what to do with tasks such as
	- 3x misc. task
	- Doing something at a certain time
### Benefits
- Seems like you can have different workspaces for school, work, etc. 
- It supports nested tag structure
- It has a calendar view
- You can add subtasks to the dataview
- Lets you filter a whitelist folder to index so your vault doesn’t slow down too much
### Downsides
- When using the calendar view (which I could view in bases), when clicking left or right for viewing the different months, the dates unfortunately don't change
- There is no live tracker for the current time in "week" view 
	- Not much of a problem
	- Might be able to be activated in settings
- Task Genius sometimes gets stuck in "Rebuilding my initial index" which last time it took 145 seconds even though it should just be searching my "private" vault.
	- It doesn't seem to load every time (like the issue `dataview` has)
- It does seem a little buggy
- It doesn't show the due date on the monthly view. 
- Potential language interference
- Quick capture feature doesn't always work
	- Typing “Does this w” makes it so you only capture a “w”. Quick capture not completely functional
