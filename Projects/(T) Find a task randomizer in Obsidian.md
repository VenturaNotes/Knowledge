## Synthesis
- [Gemini Conversation](https://aistudio.google.com/prompts/1HEqon9Nl0_CAWTebuM1uvbb5pnK-wwgR)
### Solution
- Use the `QuickAdd` system. This is because you can run custom scripts in javascript without needing to index the entire vault again. Useful!
- The `randomVaultQuestion.js` script will look for a random `#question` in my vault
### Options / Ideas
- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">Dataview</mark>
	- Basically crashes my Obsidian vault
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Random To-Do</mark>
	- Doesn't Work. Just goes to separate file.
	- Does have "regular expression" section that I could experiment with but would rather not
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Line Arrange</mark>
	- Shuffles lines but does not discriminate with completed checkboxes.
- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">QuickAdd</mark>
	- Allows me to create my own scripts which I can freely access from the command palette
