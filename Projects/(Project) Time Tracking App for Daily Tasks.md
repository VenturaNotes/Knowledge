eDon't look for another project management software. Just look for something that you can use to track time with and that's it! 

Idea for app

Have a list of objectives written down for day


- Have time estimates
- an end due date for the day
- be able to view progress from both computer and phone

Then be finished! I don't think this idea is too bad...

Plus it would be the first big project I've worked on as well. 

Idea: 
- Create an app that lets you create tasks
- It will have a time tracking button as well as a time estimate button
- There will be a feature letting you know how much time you have left
- Will also have a grouping feature.

Need to make a database feature for myself so I can actually learn what I need to!
