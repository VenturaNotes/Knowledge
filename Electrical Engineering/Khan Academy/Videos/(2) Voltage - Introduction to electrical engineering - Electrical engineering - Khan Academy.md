- Voltage is a quantity
	- Has to do with potential energy of electrical charges.
	- This will be an intuitive description of what voltage means
- Gravity and voltage are very similar ideas
- If you put mass at the top of a mountain and let it go, the potential energy (PE) that it has is going to be dissipated as kinetic energy. That mass will roll down hill.
