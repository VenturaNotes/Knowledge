- Story of current starts with idea of charge
- 2 kinds of charges
	- Positive
	- Negative
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Basic electrostatics</mark> idea
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-03 at 3.13.47 PM.png|150]]
	- If there is an opposite sign, there will be a force of attraction between them.
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">2 unlike charges attract</mark>
	- 2 like signs means that the charges will repel each other. 
		- Examples
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">2 negative charges</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">2 positive charges</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Like charges repel</mark>
- How do we get charge?
	- Copper wires (Cu with atomic number 29)
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-03 at 3.20.11 PM.png|150]]
		- Has 29 protons inside the atom and 29 electrons outside the atom
		- Copper atom has a nucleus (with some protons in it) 
			- Also has electrons orbiting around the outside ()
		- Last orbital (outermost orbital) of copper has just 1 electron
			- Easiest to pull away from copper (have it participate in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">conduction</mark> in electric current)
		- Every copper atom will be able to contribute the 1 lonely electron in the outer orbital
	- Silver also has the same electron configuration with 1 electron in the outermost orbital
- Building a copper wire (solid wire of copper atoms)
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-03 at 3.29.34 PM.png|400]]
	- Gonna put a voltage across it (with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">battery</mark>)
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The battery is marked with a positive and negative charge (to show the direction the current is flowing)</mark>
	- Inside copper is a lot of electrons (that are associated with atoms. It's a neutral piece of metal)
		- Same number of protons as there is electrons (making it neutral)
			- However, electrons are a little bit loose
	- If there is a plus on the left side of the copper wire, the electron will wander towards the positive side.
		- It will leave a net positive charge from where it moved from causing the electrons behind it to follow.
	- The electron from the negative side of the battery will go into the copper wire to make up the difference.
		- If you had a net positive charge in the copper wire on the right side from the electrons leaving and going to the left, the battery would fill those in.
			- You will get a net movement of negative charge around in a counterclockwise direction for this diagram.
- How do we measure the net movement of negative charge that's going around the copper wire? (we want to assign a number to the amount of current happening)
	- In our heads, we put a boundary that cuts all the way through the copper.
	- We count the number of electrons that move by the imaginary line in a second. We'll get charge per second ($q^-$ /sec). That it what we call <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">current</mark>
		- Same idea as water flowing by in a river
- Water and salt (build a tube of salt and water.)
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-03 at 3.38.55 PM.png]]
	- We stick the wire into the tube.
	- Water is $H_2O$ 
		- This does not conduct. There is no free electrons available. 
		- Putting table salt ($NaCl$ (sodium chloride). Sprinkling table salt into water causes it to dissolve in the water. We then have a net positive charge of sodium $Na^+$ and a net negative charge of chlorine $Cl^-$ 
	- Net movement
		- When dipping battery wires into water, the + charge in the battery is going to attract the $Cl^-$ 
		- The negative side will attract the $Na^+$ and repel the $Cl^-$ . We get a net motion of positive charge.
		- We have $-q$ going to the left and $+q$ going to the right.
		- There will be plus and minus charges moving through the boundary in the opposite direction. 
			- Taking the total sum of that (1 $Na^+$ moving to the right and 1 $Cl^-$ moving to the left), this is equal to 2 charges moving through the boundary. Because they have opposite signs, they add together and make 2 charges.
			- In this case again, current = q/sec =charge per second.
