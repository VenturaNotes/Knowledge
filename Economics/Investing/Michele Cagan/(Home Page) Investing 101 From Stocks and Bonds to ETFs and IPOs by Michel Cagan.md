## (1) Basic Economics
### Introduction
- To make money grow, the securities you invest in must grow and pay out earnings (depends on health of economy)
- “If consumers spend money, the [[economy]] can grow; if they don't, it can't.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=10&annotation=9NN66NTU))
- Economy
	- Good
		- people spend money
		- corporations prosper
		- investments grow
	- Bad
		- Consumer spending lags
		- corporate growth stagnates
		- investors see poor returns
- Consumer spending makes up most of [[gross domestic product]] (keeps economy flowing)
- Economically savvy investors focus on what's coming (profitable investing is about future growth)

### (1.1) Buying and Selling
- This is the lifeblood of the economy
- People are selling, manufacturing, consuming
- “Economics as a system allocates the things we need to live.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=11&annotation=4I4XRDP2))
- When investing money, you don't need to know too much about how the economy works
- "The intelligent investor is a realist who sells to optimists and buys from pessimists" - [[Jason Zweig]]

#### Value and Price
- “Humans buy and sell things because those things have value.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=11&annotation=BA9XC7GS))
- [[value]]: What you use something for
	- food to survive
	- car for transportation
	- movie tickets for entertainment
- [[price]]: monetary value we assign them
- “[[Value]] isn't constant, though.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=12&annotation=GSP5WT5G))
	- Price of gasoline not as high as it was several years ago
		- Humans use less gasoline $\to$ lower demand $\to$ price correspondingly drops
		- oil-producing countries stepped up production $\to$ overproduction $\to$ price drops
- If supply increases, price falls
- Demand increases, price rises

#### Income
- “[[Income]] is money you receive from different sources—your job, gifts, inheritances, investments—to buy what you need.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=12&annotation=PPSTGTK2))
- “Economists consider various kinds of income, including [[national income]], [[per capita income]] (that is, the average income a person has), and [[disposable income]] (the amount of money you and your family can spend after you pay your taxes).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=12&annotation=A5FY9JTG))
- [[Social Security]] helps after you retire

#### Consumption
- [[Consumption]] is what you and your family consume; that is, it's how much you spend on goods and services
	- Consumption should be in line with income
- [[Personal Consumption Expenditure]]
	- Sites that track this
		- Bureau of Economic Analysis (www.bea.gov)
		- Bureau of Labor Statistics (www.bls.gov)

#### Saving and Investment
- “during the 1960s, the average American saved 6-10 percent of her or his income.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=13&annotation=R34I6H4D))
- “That declined in the 1990s, and today it hovers around zero.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=13&annotation=XYUN46F6))
	- Not enough to just save. Need to make the money work for us

### (1.2) Interest Rates
- Borrowing and Lending
- “[[Interest rates]] are the prices [[borrowers]] of money pay to the [[lenders]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=15&annotation=KL6JN8DD))
	- Stocks, bonds, real estate all affected by interest rates
- “[[interest]] is just something we earn on our savings accounts, or (more often) more money we have to pay to credit card companies.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=15&annotation=45TI2IDP))
	- Interest is a number connected with mortgage payments
- [[Federal Reserve]]
	- Created 1913
	- “responsibility of creating and maintaining interest rates and administering U.S. monetary policy” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=15&annotation=Z24C63XD))
	- “supervises and regulates banks and acts as a financial servicer for the U.S. government and various lending institutions.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=15&annotation=GMV8AHZW))
- “Federal Reserve has the power to manipulate the [[federal funds rate]], which is the interest rate that Federal Reserve banks charge other banks like yours to borrow money.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=16&annotation=28FEDNJ5))
	- Affects
		- car loan
		- mortgage
		- credit cards
	- Controls inflation
		- By raising the rate, prevents inflation from spiraling out of control
			- Has effect of limiting amount of money available for consumer spending
			- Higher interest rate = more money to interest payments and less shopping
- When more interest needs to be payed, less spending, investors take a hit
- [[Federal funds rate]] doesn't immediately impact markets but through consumer spending and corporate bottom lines
	- Corporations paying more to borrow money $\to$ less money for [[dividend pool]] $\to$ less money to future growth
- Corporations with diminishing profits see their share prices drop right alongside disappearing earnings
- [[Interest rate]] increase can push stock prices down
- Effects of lower rates
	- When [[Federal Reserve|Fed]] lowers interest rates
		- money supply increases
		- signals investors to buy stocks (risk/return scale now looks attractive)
		- economic expansion $\to$ corporate growth $\to$ increased value of corporate shares
- higher federal funds rate $\to$ higher interest rates paid to newly issued [[Treasury securities]]
	- “These risk-free investments guarantee you steady returns, and when rates go up, you're guaranteed bigger interest payments on these government securities.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=17&annotation=S7CHTCFB))
	- Has effect of higher interest rates on newly issued [[municipal bonds]] and [[corporate bonds]]
### (1.3) Economic Indicators
- Signposts in the Marketplace
- [[Leading indicators]]
	- Special economic statistics giving us clues on whether the economy will make a turn or remain on course
	- “Take the lead in predicting which way the economy is headed” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=18&annotation=6FFTX9PE))
- Used to confirm economic trends
	- [[Coincident indicators]]
	- [[Lagging indicators]]
- “The idea that a bell rings to signal when investors should get into or out of the market is simply not credible.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=18&annotation=TJLKIDAQ)) - [[John C. Bogle]]
- [[Economic indicators]]
	- Tied with inflation
		- Strongly influences level of interest rates (impacts stability of economy)
	- Linked with production or foreign trade (eventually impacting consumer goods prices)

#### Indicators and You
- Leading indicators
	- “investors typically focus on leading indicators” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=19&annotation=U669PLJA))
	- “profits often come from future events and expectations.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=19&annotation=SVJBNIS9))
- “Eight of the most important economic indicators are discussed here.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=19&annotation=9ZQ2C9BU))
	- [[gross domestic product|GDP]]
	- [[consumer price index|CPI]]
	- [[unemployment index]]
	- [[job growth]]
	- [[housing starts]]
	- [[producer price index]]
	- [[consumer confidence index]]
	- [[business inventories]]

#### Gross Domestic Product
- “GDP is the most important economic indicator published.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=19&annotation=L8W2XIXH))
- “broadest measure of economic activity, the GDP is considered the nation's report card.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=19&annotation=MV9FJ6EX))
- Four major components of GDP
	- [[Consumption]]
	- [[Investment]]
	- [[Government Purchases]]
	- [[Net Exports]]
- “This [[lagging index]] takes months to compute and even longer to finalize.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=20&annotation=ADRJ5FG3))
	- Let's us know if economy growing or shrinking

#### Consumer Price Index
- Released by [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] (BLS)
	- Directly linked with [[inflation rate]]
- “index tracks retail-level price changes by comparing prices for a specific basket of goods and services to base-period prices.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=20&annotation=5NHA2YKK))
- “CPI covers both domestically produced and imported goods” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=20&annotation=BIAGMFQP))
	- Some critics believe CPI is basically the measured inflation rate which is purposely understated since it's a factor used to increase [[Social Security]] payments

#### Consumer Confidence
- “monitors consumer sentiment based on monthly interviews with thousands of households.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=20&annotation=VUP428LL))
- “dropped drastically after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=20&annotation=HZZVG8W3))
- Afterwards for several years, “consumers were maintaining buying patterns despite rising gasoline prices and interest rates.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=20&annotation=EMFQVR7V))
- Index dropped again in 2008 (frightened consumers to save money)
	- Home foreclosures
	- credit crisis
	- Struggling markets
	- Government bailouts
- “serves as a reflection of the nation's financial health.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=20&annotation=4JDIHFMY))
	- “important to the financial markets during times of national crisis or panic.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=20&annotation=8355XWIY))
- If consumers not confident $\to$ don't spend money $\to$ market in a slump

#### Job Growth
- “Second only to the GDP, the government's employment report is one of the most important economic indicators.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=21&annotation=QIEEHEMQ))
- Statistics include
	- Employment information
		- Length of average workweek
		- hourly earnings
		- unemployment rate
- “indicator sets the tone for the upcoming investing month.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=21&annotation=FNQQF7IF))
- Higher the job growth $\to$ consumers feel more at ease $\to$ spend more
- Job growth shrinks $\to$ people get nervous $\to$ strong indicator that economy could enter a downturn

#### Unemployment Index
- “subset of the government's employment report.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=21&annotation=N7D6PB4T))
- “Unlike the total jobs data, which is considered a [[coincident indicator]], the unemployment index is a [[lagging indicator]]; it changes following a change in the economy as a whole.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=21&annotation=892FG5EL))
- “unemployment index less significant to investors, who are looking toward the economic future.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=21&annotation=KQX6XM49))
- “several months of low unemployment rates can signal that higher inflation is right around the corner.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=21&annotation=LVCFK7VD))

#### Housing Starts
- “measures the new construction of single-family homes or buildings each month.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=21&annotation=MX8TF7C9))
- Survey
	- “Each individual house and every single apartment count as one housing start; a building with 150 apartments counts as 150 housing starts.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=22&annotation=IRDGFSDQ))
- LEI index
	- [[leading economic indicators]]
		- “purports to predict future economic activity.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=22&annotation=QF8CESLT))
	- “when the LEI moves in the same direction for three consecutive months, that suggests an economic turning point.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=22&annotation=5THXZC4R))
		- “three positive readings in a row would indicate an impending recovery.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=22&annotation=G4CYC8HG))
- “[[housing industry]] represents more than 25 percent of total investment dollars and about 5 percent of the total economy, as per the [[U.S. Census Bureau]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=22&annotation=8M8EUEFH))
	- Declining housing $\to$ slumping economy
	- Increasing housing activity $\to$ road to recovery

#### Business Inventories
- “monthly running total of how well companies are selling their products,” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=22&annotation=Y57KPY3W))
- “business inventory data are collected from three sources:” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=22&annotation=HEKUM3GZ))
	- Manufacturing
	- Merchant wholesalers
	- Retail reports
- “[[Retail inventories]] are the most volatile component of inventories and can cause major swings.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=23&annotation=IDKZ87SU))
	- Fall in inventories $\to$ onset expansion
	- Accumulation of inventories $\to$ falling demand $\to$ onset recession

#### Producer Price Index
- “put out by the BLS, tracks wholesale price changes.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=23&annotation=CT3MZ9KE))
- “breakdowns on raw materials (a.k.a. [[commodities]]), [[intermediate goods]] (items that are in production), and [[finished goods]] (ready to hit the shelves).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=23&annotation=Y5TNRV3R))
	- “Every month, nearly 100,000 prices are collected from approximately 30,000 manufacturing and production companies and manufacturing businesses.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=23&annotation=9LBVZXTW))
- “This [[coincident indicator]] is often a good predictor of the direction of the CPI.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=23&annotation=JBS4VTM6))
### (1.4) Sectors
- Sorting out Industries
- [[Sector rotation]]
- “Different types of industries perform better during specific stages in the [[economic cycle]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=24&annotation=L4I56PFY))
	- Some industries take off when economy expanding
	- Others profit when economy in a slump
- “[[sector]] is a unique industry group.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=24&annotation=JX4Z3BZM))
- “Financial professionals—use the terms [[sector]] and [[industry]] interchangeably, but they aren't really the same.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=24&annotation=8U47KNHQ))
	- “[[Industry]] describes a specific set of businesses, while sector is a broader term” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=24&annotation=DFU423WQ))
- “a sector is technically a broad section of the overall economy and can include more than one industry..” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=24&annotation=D7KLE47K))
- [[Financial sector]] includes for example six distinct industries
	- [[banking]]
	- [[Investment banking]]

	- [[accounting]]
	- [[insurance]]
	- [[asset management]]

#### Where in the Cycle Are We?

- Can find economic analyses in most big financial newspapers such as the Wall Street Journal
- Can find information on state of U.S. economy from [[Bureau of Economic Analysis]] at www.bea.gov
- When you know where economy is, can better predict where it's gong to go from there
	- economic cycle follows a very definite pattern
		- “When the economy is in a deep recession, the next phase of the cycle will be an upturn, a very good time to begin investing more actively.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=25&annotation=DZ7ZWU7K))
		- Therefore, can make profit regardless of prevailing economic state
- Invest in [[Sector Funds]]
	- “diversify your portfolio and take advantage of sector rotation by investing in sector funds.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=25&annotation=SD6N3DKU))
	- “These [[mutual funds]] invest in single economic sectors (like [[technology]] or [[healthcare]]), and sometimes even more focused sector subsets (like [[electronics]] or [[pharmaceuticals]])” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=25&annotation=3RSD6822))
	- Sector funds expose more risk than broad-based mutual funds but also bring higher returns
- “[[Sector rotation]] describes the movement of profitability through different sectors as the economy goes through its cycles.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=25&annotation=63GI6AEJ)
	- Different sectors thrive depending on cycle
	- “Basic sectors are highly predictable, following the economic cycle like clockwork.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=25&annotation=DB78M43S))
- “[[utilities sector]] and [[services sectors]] tend to perform well during an economic downturn;” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=26&annotation=HUY9GHYD))
	- “as that downturn segues into a full [[recession]], the [[technology]], [[cyclical|cyclicals]], and [[industrial]] sectors will start to flourish.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=26&annotation=ASY637DL))
- During economic [[recovery]]
	- [[basic materials]] and [[energy]] perform best
- “full thriving economy, the [[consumer staples sector]] will really take off.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=26&annotation=RYYZ9DAT))
- “If you know what stage the economy is in now, you know where in the cycle it will be going next” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=26&annotation=BW4FTWH6))

#### An Index for Everything
- [[Benchmarks]] let financial professionals measure how an investment is doing
	- “benchmarks are known as indexes, and they cover every sector of the financial markets, from small-cap stocks to emerging nation bonds.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=26&annotation=WG65T34L))

- “[[Dow number]] is calculated by adding up the prices of all the stocks, then dividing by the number of stocks included in the index, adjusted for stock splits.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=27&annotation=9X6ZS4V7))
	- “each company carries equal weight.”

#### Two Proven Ways to Analyze Stocks
- “[[technical analysis]] or [[fundamental analysis]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=37&annotation=9DXQHWL6))
	- “Technical analysis is all about stock prices and how they move, and it relies on charts and graphs to determine patterns.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=RVQEIF2Q))
	- “Fundamental analysis, more common among beginning investors, involves studying the company itself, with a focus on financial statements and performance.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=56UZPYJR))
- Savvy investors combine both techniques
	- “a stock with great fundamentals and sagging price trends could indicate trouble on the horizon.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=CZKE29GX))
- “Technical analysis focuses on charts and graphs showing past stock price and volume patterns.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=JUMIBXW7))
	- “Believe you can forecast future stock prices by studying past price trends.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=38ZXWVET))
		- Based on stock price movements
	- “Technical analysts tend to do much more buying and selling than fundamental analysts.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=85M63WRJ))
- “Fundamental analysis is a long-used, common way to review stocks.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=ISLPEAK7))
	- “Analysis of the company's ability to generate earnings and an examination of the value of the company's total assets.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=3ALYYDDP))
	- “[[Value investing]] and [[growth investing]] are two subdivisions of fundamental analysis.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=DVWXU2ST))
	- “Believe that stock prices will rise as a result of growth.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=MR263S33))
	- “Earnings, dividends, and book values are all examined, and a buy-and-hold approach is usually followed.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=DL5ZPGRD))
	- “stock in well-run, high-quality companies will become more valuable over time.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=38&annotation=4UQT599H))

		- Dividend: $1.50
		- Price Change $3.00
		- Dividend + Price Change = $4.50
		- $\frac {\$4.50}{\$45.00} = .10$
			- Total Return is a 10% increase
- Analyze Dividends

	- “investing only in companies that embody their personal values.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=58&annotation=C4JPEAP9))
	- “These corporations don't produce tobacco products, liquor, weapons, or environmentally damaging products.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=58&annotation=2NEGBD5X))

#### Penny Stocks
- “[[Penny stocks]] are stocks that sell for $5 or less, and in many cases you're lucky if they're worth even that much.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=59&annotation=V39DZ3N2))
	- Penny stocks usually have no substantial income or revenue
	- Don't be tempted to act on a "hot tip"
- [[Pink sheets]]
	- “Penny stocks trade in either the pink sheets, a forum operated by the [[National Quotation Bureau]], or on the NASDAQ small-cap market.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=59&annotation=MW3JTB7U))
	- Pink sheets are “listings and price information literally printed on pink sheets of paper that go to select brokers.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=59&annotation=JMH5EYKT))
- “companies behind these stocks are thinly capitalized and are often not required to file reports with the SEC.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=59&annotation=JXR6NMQ7))
- Trade over the counter and limited public information available
- An alarming aspect of penny stock dealing is that “[[brokers]] are not always acting as a third party” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=59&annotation=DKJXIKR7)) 
	- instead set prices and [[act as principals]] in the transaction
- “Penny stocks most often do not have a single price but a number of different prices at which they can be purchased or sold.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=60&annotation=65FI6R2M))

## (3) Bonds, Mutual Funds, and ETFs
### Introduction
- Three most popular ways to invest
	- [[Bonds]]
	- [[Mutual funds]]
		- Essentially hiring someone else to manage your money
	- [[exchange-traded funds]]
### (3.1) What are Bonds?
- Loaning Money for Interest
- “[[Bonds]] are part of a completely different asset class than stocks.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=62&annotation=4BP8ML34))
- [[Bond market]] similar to [[stock market]]
	- Bond market more heavily influenced by economic and political trends
- World economy depends on international bond trading
	- world bond market considered more influential than stock market

#### The Definition of Bonds
- “[[Bonds]] are marketable securities that represent a loan to a company, a [[municipality]], the federal government, or a foreign government with the expectation that the loan will be paid back at a set date in the future (that is to say, when the bond matures)” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=62&annotation=CQVM4Q79))
	- Bonds come with an interest component
		- Can involve periodic payments over the life of the bond or single payments at maturity
- “Bonds can be bought directly as new issues from the government, from a municipality, or from a company.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=62&annotation=BKAX7KAK))
	- “can also be bought from bond traders, brokers, or dealers on the secondary market.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=62&annotation=VXSG4GRB))
- “bond market dictates how easily you can buy or sell a bond, and at what price.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=62&annotation=E6Q9LEPU))
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Why Sell Bonds?</mark>
	- Governments (whether [[municipal]], [[state]] or [[federal]]) sell bonds to raise money
		- Money usually for a specific project (bridge, repairing road)
		- During Second World War, federal government sold bonds to raise money for war
- Large part of bonds is interest
	- For lending money, [[borrower]] agrees to pay buyer a specific rate of interest at predetermined intervals
		- Bonds sold in discrete increments (typically multiple of $1,000 (few exceptions)) known as their [[par value]] or face value.
- Bonds' maturities and interest rates vary
	- [[Short-term bonds]] mature in up to five years
	- [[Intermediate-term bonds]] mature generally at seven to ten years
	- [[Long-term bonds]] usually mature around twenty to thirty years
		- Generally higher interest rates (averaging higher than 6% over last 50 years) than short-term bonds
- Though the bond's stated interest rate is a known factor, over time its [[yield (Economics)|yield]] will fluctuate along with changes in prevailing interest rates (matters if trying to sell bond)
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Use bonds to Diversify</mark>
	- Bonds can supply you with steady interest income
	- Bond values often move in the opposite direction of the stock market
	- Important part of [[asset allocation strategies]] essential for good portfolio management
- Bond has date of [[final maturity]]. This is the date the bond will return your [[principal investment]]
- [[Callable bonds]] can be redeemed by issuer earlier than maturity date (lender pays back sooner than expected)
	- The buyer of a bond is a [[lender]]. The seller of a bond is a [[borrower]]. [^2]
		- So it seems like the author meant to say borrower pays back instead of lender?
			- But perhaps the issuer becomes the lender? Not sure #archive
- “A $5,000 bond is worth $5,000 upon maturity (regardless of the price that bond would fetch on the open market), as long as the [[issuer]] does not default on the payment.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=64&annotation=R4A2PSYS))
	- Interest on bond is your perk
	- [[Interest]] is paid semiannually or annually and compounds at different rates

#### Bonds versus Stocks
- [[bondholder]] does not take part in success or failure of company as opposed to [[stockholder|stockholders]]. 
	- [[Share|Shares]] of stock will rise and fall in conjunction with company's fortunes
	- For bonds, will receive interest on loan and get principal back at date of maturity (unless bankruptcy)
- [[Bonds]] are fixed-income investments unless you sell before maturity, then market determines price
- [[Corporate bond]] prices can be affected by corporate earnings (similar to stock prices)
	- Affected much stronger degree by fluctuation in interest rates
		- “bond market itself often takes the lead in setting those rates.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=65&annotation=69WGQZ4V))
	- “both types of securities are subject to influences like terrorism, politics, and fraud.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=65&annotation=ET2GHHEZ))

#### Seven Features
- When considering a [[bonds|bond]], analyze these features
	- [[Price]]
	- [[Stated interest rate]]
	- [[Current yield]]
	- [[Maturity]]
	- [[Redemption features]]
	- [[Credit rating]]
	- [[Income tax impact]]

#### Bond Risks
- “U.S. government bonds, are considered less risky than stocks” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=65&annotation=GWK7B8EG))
	- “little chance the government will go bankrupt).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=66&annotation=KMG72XQS))
	- Conservative investment
- Bonds give higher rate of interest than from a bank account or CD
	- Steady flow of interest income makes them safe
- Risks
	- “The most basic risk is that an issuer may default, meaning you will not get your money back.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=66&annotation=YZRDGFDV))
	- “lose money in bonds if you are forced to sell when interest rates are high.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=66&annotation=VNY8AXKX))
	- returns not as high compared to risky [[equity mutual funds]] or from a hot stock
### (3.2) Why Buy Bonds?
#### Reduce Risk
- [[bond mutual funds]]
	- best if you have a lower tolerance for risk
- Benefits
	- “offsetting the investor's exposure to the volatility of the stock market.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=67&annotation=FPKMRGKY))
		- Bonds will behave differently from markets move
	- “provide a scheduled stream of interest payments (except [[zero-coupon bonds]], which pay their interest at maturity).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=67&annotation=GUPDQW7N))
- “[[Callable bonds]] and [[pass-through securities]] have less predictability, but investors are compensated for the uncertainty in the form of higher yields.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=67&annotation=ZR8C3D8Q))
- “[[bonds]] are designed to return the original investment, or principal, to the investor at a future maturity date.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=67&annotation=JV5TMFY3))
	- “can still lose your principal investment if you sell your bonds before maturity at a price lower than your purchase price, or if the [[borrower]] [[defaults]] on payment.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=68&annotation=CY2ML5AT))
	- “high-credit-quality bonds, you can limit your exposure to [[default risk]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=68&annotation=4FVY7AV7))
- “certain bonds provide unique tax benefits.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=68&annotation=P6C4IXTK))
	- “won't be paying any state or local income tax on interest you've earned on your [[U.S. Treasury bonds]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=68&annotation=CNF5V2IL))
	- “interest on your [[municipal bonds]] (usually) won't be subject to a federal income tax bite, and in some cases, they'll be free of state or local income taxes, too.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=68&annotation=L264B6NY))
	- “A good [[broker]] or [[tax advisor]] can help you determine which bonds are best for you.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=68&annotation=K7Y4ZYDE))

#### The Risks Unique to Bonds
##### Call Risk
- [[Call risk]]
- “issuer can buy you out of your investment before maturity.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=68&annotation=4IKCJIEA))
- Happens when rates drop and they want to call in high-interest bonds to issue new ones at a lower rate
- “less common, especially in a period of stable or rising interest rates.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=69&annotation=AMI2YTL3))

##### Credit Risk
- [[Credit Risk]]
- “risk of default by the company issuing the bond, resulting in the loss of your principal investment.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=69&annotation=BL8Y5HXM))
- “bonds are [[rated]], just like people looking for [[credit]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=69&annotation=Q6Y9GI29))
	- “[[Government bonds]]—at least in theory—don't have this risk and therefore need not be graded; they are simply safe investments.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=69&annotation=28UIDI3V))
- “compare the risk and the yield, or return, you will get from different [[grades]] of bonds.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=69&annotation=MP5MSJCJ))
- “high-grade tax-exempt municipal bond than you will do with a lower-grade taxable corporate bond, take the safer route and buy the municipal bond.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=69&annotation=SJYBRG36))
	- “riskier bonds, or lower-grade bonds, is only worthwhile if you will potentially see returns big enough to merit taking that [[credit risk]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=69&annotation=I54ZPE9S))

##### Interest-Rate Risk
- [[Interest-Rate Risk]]
- If holding bond to maturity, won't be affected by changing interest rates much
- “if you are selling a bond, you need to concern yourself with the rate of interest that ties in with the [[yield (Economics)|yield]] of the bond.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=69&annotation=RRLI7TT3))
	- “risk is that you will be stuck holding a long-term bond that pays less than the current interest rate, making it hard to sell and reinvest your capital.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=69&annotation=JBCXY385))
- Avoid Defensive buying
	- For [[bonds]], buy it and hold to maturity. Buying it just in case you need to sell is [[defensive buying]] (which may be regrettable in long run)
- “The longer the [[maturity]] of the [[bond]], the more a change in [[yield]] will affect the price.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=70&annotation=ELW849FL))
- “You will better manage [[interest-rate risk]] by buying shorter maturities and rolling them over.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=70&annotation=7SEAJSGI))
	- For higher returns over a longer period of time, go for longer-term [[bond]] and hope not to sell it
- [[Long-term bonds]] give higher yields than[[ short-term bonds]]. These bonds are best if you plan to hold them to maturity because you won't necessarily need to worry about interest-rate fluctuations on bonds.

#### Income Risk
- [[Income risk]]
- “This is a double risk: first that should you sell, you won't get the full value (or [[par]]), and second that [[inflation]] will surpass the rate of income you are receiving from the bond (known as [[inflation risk]])” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=71&annotation=LI7YDJ4Y))
	- Reinvesting [[interest income]] means less immediate income
- Managing Income risk
	- Stagger or [[ladder]] your bonds to pick up the higher interest rates along the way
- Managing inflation risk
	- re-evaluate asset allocation
	- Move investment higher than the inflation rate until it drops
- Could reinvest income from a bond paying a rate less than inflation in a higher-yield vehicle
	- [[Equity fund]] more likely to beat [[inflation rate]]

### (3.3) Bond Ratings and Yields
- How good is a bond?
- “[[Corporate bonds]] and some [[municipal bonds]] are [[rated]] by [[financial analysts]] at [[Standard & Poor's]] (S&P) and Moody's, among others.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/ATFBW7CW?page=72&annotation=EUGUQH6N))
