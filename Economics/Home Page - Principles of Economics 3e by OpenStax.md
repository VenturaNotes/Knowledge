## (1) Welcome to Economics!
### Introduction
- [[Economics]] is greatly impacted by how well information travels through society
- Social media giants such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[Instagram]] are major forces on the information super highway
- “[[Economists]] love nothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under conditions of perfect information,” says [[Jessica Irvine]], National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=25&annotation=BRYN3S2M))
	- #question what is meant by perfect information?
	- #question what is a deep and liquid market?
- “making choices is at the heart of what economists study” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=XVQBN2IC))
- “[[Economics]] is probably not what you think. It is not primarily about money or finance. It is not primarily about business. It is not mathematics. What is it then? It is both a subject area and a way of viewing the world.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=Z79LWJF6))
### (1.1) What is Economics, and Why Is It Important?
- “[[Economics]] is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=3PALJKVP))
	- [[Individual decisions]]
	- [[Family decisions]]
	- [[Business decisions]]
	- [[Societal decisions]]
- [[Scarcity]] is a fact of life
	- It means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available
	- “[[Resources]], such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=SIULHCKR))
- Ultimate scarce resource is time
	- We only have 24 hours in a day to earn income to acquire goods and services, for leisure time, or for sleep
	- “At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=N2GJUT86))
- In 2015, the [[labor force]] in the United States contained over 158 million workers, according to the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]. The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles
	- “Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=9MYCKYXG))
	- “Combine this with the fact that [[human wants]] seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=FYW4RVQD))
#### Introduction to FRED
- “[[Data]] is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that economics seek to understand.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=LG3TYDV2))
- “A variety of [[government agencies]] publish economic and social data” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=QNDB8EZU))
- Will be using data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database for this course
- [[FRED]] is very user friendly
	- Can display data in tables or charts, easily download it into spreadsheet form if you want to use the data for other purposes
- The [FRED website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/12) includes data on nearly 400,000 domestic and international variables over time, in the following broad categories
	- [[Money]], [[Banking]] & [[Finance]]
	- [[Population (Statistics)|Population]], [[Employment]], & [[Labor Markets]] (including [[Income Distribution]])
	- [[National Accounts]] ([[Gross Domestic Products]] & its components), [[Flow of Funds]], and [[International Accounts]]
	- [[Production]] & [[Business Activity]] (including [[Business Cycles]])
	- [[Prices]] & [[Inflation]] (including the [[Consumer Price Index]], the [[Producer Price Index]], and the [[Employment Cost Index]])
	- [[International Data]] from other nations
	- [[U.S. Regional Data]]
	- [[Academic Data]] (including [[Penn World Tables]] & [[NBER Macrohistory database]])
- Here is a [playlist on how to use FRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaQWUgGG7V4&list=PLKcwEC4jDwiN5sOIay2qkpjTuvRTvkdso)
- “People experiencing homelessness are a stark reminder that scarcity of resources is real.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=27&annotation=5SWTALSF))
	- [[Scarcity]] is a problem. In every country in the world, there are people who are hungry, homeless, and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services.
		- This is the case because of scarcity.
#### The Problem of Scarcity
- “things you [[consume (economics)|consume]]: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=27&annotation=TA9NWILS))
	- We acquire these items by buying them.
	- You afford the things you buy by working for pay.
		- If you do not, someone else does on your behalf. 
	- Most of us never have enough income to buy the things we want because of scarcity.
- Read [this](https://stateimpact.npr.org/texas/2013/08/02/how-10-western-cities-are-dealing-with-water-scarcity-and-drought/) to see how the United States is dealing with scarcity in resources
	- #question I should read the above article
- Every society at every level must make choices about how to use its [[resources]]
	- Families decide on new car or fancy vacation
	- Towns choose budget for police and fire protection or into school system
	- Nations choose between funding national defense or protecting the environment
- “In most cases, there just isn’t enough money in the budget to do everything.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=27&annotation=AUNEEFBF))
- “How do we use our limited resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods and services we can?” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=27&annotation=B8QIHGPX))
	- We each could produce everything we consume
	- “we could each produce some of what we want to consume, and “trade” for the rest of what we want.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=27&annotation=6A9JG8FA))
- Why do we not just produce all the things we consumer?
	- During the pioneer days, individuals knew how to
		- Build their homes
		- Grow their crops
		- Hunt for food
		- Repair their equipment
- Most of us do not know how to do these things not because we could not learn but because we do not have to.
	- Reason why is called [[the division and specialization of labor]], a production innovation first put forth by [[Adam Smith]] in his book, [[The Wealth of Nations]]
		- #question what is a production innovation?
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 2.53.16 AM.png|200]]
		- “Adam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=28&annotation=NNVK6MHL))

#### The Division of and Specialization of Labor
- “The formal study of [[economics]] began when [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790) published his famous book [[The Wealth of Nations]] 1776.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=28&annotation=8Z9QZHM2))
	- “Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=28&annotation=9LP2MCKB))
- In the first chapter, he introduces the concept [[division of labor]]
	- It means that the way one produces a good or service is divided into a number of tasks that different workers perform (instead of all the tasks being done by the same person)
- Division of labor example
	- Smith counted how many tasks went into making a pin (18 distinct tasks)
		- Drawing out a piece of wire
		- Cutting right length
		- Straightening it
		- Putting head on one end and point on other
		- Packaging pins for sale
- Modern businesses divide tasks as well
	- [[Restaurant]] divides tasks of serving meals into a range of jobs
		- [[top chef]]
		- [[sous chefs]]
		- less-skilled kitchen help
		- servers to wait tables
		- Greeter at door
		- Janitors to clean up
		- [[Business manager]] to handle paychecks and bills
		- Economic connections a restaurant has with suppliers
			- food
			- furniture
			- kitchen equipment
			- building where it's located
- “A complex business like a large [[manufacturing factory]], such as the [[shoe factory]] (Figure 1.4), or a [[hospital]] can have hundreds of job classifications.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=28&annotation=C2YRIHE9))
	- “Workers on an [[assembly line]] are an example of the divisions of labor.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=28&annotation=5R36USM7))
	- “Red Wing Shoe Factory Tour” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=28&annotation=S59NA3MY))

#### Why the Division of Labor Increases Production
- “When we divide and subdivide the tasks involved with producing a good or service, workers and businesses can produce a greater quantity of output.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=6ARCJYLP))
- [[Adam Smith]] noticed in [[pin factories]] that one worker might make 20 pins in a day. However, 10 workers who would need to complete two or three of the 18 tasks involved could make 48,000 pins a day.
- [[Adam Smith]] offered 3 reasons why specializing in certain tasks produce so much more than the same number of workers who try to produce the entire good or service by themselves
	- “First, [[specialization]] in a particular small job allows workers to focus on the parts of the production process where they have an advantage.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=HEZ85QA7)) (will discuss [[comparative advantage]] later)
		- “[[People]] have different skills, talents, and interests, so they will be better at some jobs than at others.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=PEZ937TN))
			- “particular advantages may be based on educational choices, which are in turn shaped by interests and talents.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=6LVJ3M4Y))
			- “Only those with medical degrees qualify to become doctors, for instance” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=SBQS4ZHF))
			- “For some goods, [[geography]] affects [[specialization]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=T86WZM2T))
				- [[Wheat farmer]] in [[North Dakota]] easier than in [[Florida]]
				- [[Tourist hotel]] in Florida easier than North Dakota
				- Living near a big city is easier to attract customers to operate a successful [[dry cleaning business]] or [[movie theater]] than if you live in a sparsely populated rural area
		- In summary, if people specialize in production of what they do best, they will be more effective than if they produce a combination of things, some of which are good at and some of which they are not
	- “Secondly, workers who specialize in certain tasks often learn to produce more quickly and with higher quality.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=3KYUY277))
		- True for many workers including
			- [[Assembly line laborers]] who build cars
			- [[stylists]] who cut hair
			- [[doctors]] who perform heart surgery
		- [[Specialized workers]] often know their jobs well enough to suggest innovative ways to do their work faster and better
		- “In many cases, a [[business]] that focuses on one or a few products (sometimes called its “[[core competency]]”) is more successful than firms that try to make a wide range of products.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=5C9NEVFU))
	- “Third, specialization allows businesses to take advantage of [[economies of scale]], which means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=DUFMSJAK))
		- Example
			- If a [[factory]] produces only 100 cars per year, each car will be quite expensive to make on average
			- If a factory produces 50,000 cars a year, then it can set up an [[assembly line]] with huge machines and workers performing specialized tasks, and the average cost of production per car will be lower. 
				- Result of workers who can
					- Focus on their preferences and talents
					- Learn to do their specialized jobs better
					- Work in larger organizations
				- Then society as a whole can [[produce (economics)|produce]] and [[consume (economics)|consume]] far more than if each person tried to produce all of their own goods and services.
				- “[[The division and specialization of labor]] has been a force against the problem of scarcity.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=9FREB3XP))

#### Trade and Markets
- “[[Specialization]] only makes sense, though, if workers can use the pay they receive for doing their jobs to purchase the other goods and services that they need” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=IVZBZTFQ)). In short, [[specialization]] requires trade
- You don't need to know anything about [[electronics]] or [[sound systems]] to play [[music]]
	- Just use an [[iPod]] or [[MP3 player]], download the music, and listen
- “You do not have to know anything about [[artificial fibers]] or the construction of [[sewing machines]] if you need a [[jacket]]—you just buy the jacket and wear it.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=WAWAT6IN))
- “You do not need to know anything about [[internal combustion engines]] to operate a [[car]]—you just get in and drive.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=NVVDSWMD))
- “Instead of trying to acquire all the knowledge and skills involved in producing all of the goods and services that you wish to consume, the [[market]] allows you to learn a specialized set of skills and then use the pay you receive to buy the goods and services you need or want.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=SRP7C3YL))
	- “This is how our [[modern society]] has evolved into a strong [[economy]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=29&annotation=752E3GHU))
