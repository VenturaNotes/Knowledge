## (1) Welcome to Economics!
### Introduction
- [[Economics]] is greatly impacted by how well information travels through society
- Social media giants such as [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], and [[Instagram]] are major forces on the information super highway
- “[[Economists]] love nothing better than when deep and liquid markets operate under conditions of perfect information,” says [[Jessica Irvine]], National Economics Editor for News Corp Australia.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=25&annotation=BRYN3S2M))
	- #question what is meant by perfect information?
	- #question what is a deep and liquid market?
- “making choices is at the heart of what economists study” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=XVQBN2IC))
- “[[Economics]] is probably not what you think. It is not primarily about money or finance. It is not primarily about business. It is not mathematics. What is it then? It is both a subject area and a way of viewing the world.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=Z79LWJF6))
### (1.1) What is Economics, and Why Is It Important?
- “[[Economics]] is the study of how humans make decisions in the face of scarcity.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=3PALJKVP))
	- [[Individual decisions]]
	- [[Family decisions]]
	- [[Business decisions]]
	- [[Societal decisions]]
- [[Scarcity]] is a fact of life
	- It means that human wants for goods, services and resources exceed what is available
	- “[[Resources]], such as labor, tools, land, and raw materials are necessary to produce the goods and services we want but they exist in limited supply.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=SIULHCKR))
- Ultimate scarce resource is time
	- We only have 24 hours in a day to earn income to acquire goods and services, for leisure time, or for sleep
	- “At any point in time, there is only a finite amount of resources available.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=N2GJUT86))
- In 2015, the [[labor force]] in the United States contained over 158 million workers, according to the U.S. [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]]. The total land area was 3,794,101 square miles
	- “Because these resources are limited, so are the numbers of goods and services we produce with them.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=9MYCKYXG))
	- “Combine this with the fact that [[human wants]] seem to be virtually infinite, and you can see why scarcity is a problem” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=FYW4RVQD))
#### Introduction to FRED
- “[[Data]] is very important in economics because it describes and measures the issues and problems that economics seek to understand.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=LG3TYDV2))
- “A variety of [[government agencies]] publish economic and social data” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=26&annotation=QNDB8EZU))
- Will be using data from the St. Louis Federal Reserve Bank's FRED database for this course
- [[FRED]] is very user friendly
	- Can display data in tables or charts, easily download it into spreadsheet form if you want to use the data for other purposes
- The [FRED website](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/categories/12) includes data on nearly 400,000 domestic and international variables over time, in the following broad categories
	- [[Money]], [[Banking]] & [[Finance]]
	- [[Population]], [[Employment]], & [[Labor Markets]] (including [[Income Distribution]])
	- [[National Accounts]] ([[Gross Domestic Products]] & its components), [[Flow of Funds]], and [[International Accounts]]
	- [[Production]] & [[Business Activity]] (including [[Business Cycles]])
	- [[Prices]] & [[Inflation]] (including the [[Consumer Price Index]], the [[Producer Price Index]], and the [[Employment Cost Index]])
	- [[International Data]] from other nations
	- [[U.S. Regional Data]]
	- [[Academic Data]] (including [[Penn World Tables]] & [[NBER Macrohistory database]])
- Here is a [playlist on how to use FRED](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TaQWUgGG7V4&list=PLKcwEC4jDwiN5sOIay2qkpjTuvRTvkdso)
- “People experiencing homelessness are a stark reminder that scarcity of resources is real.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=27&annotation=5SWTALSF))
	- [[Scarcity]] is a problem. In every country in the world, there are people who are hungry, homeless, and in need of healthcare, just to focus on a few critical goods and services.
		- This is the case because of scarcity.
#### The Problem of Scarcity
- “things you [[consume (economics)|consume]]: food, shelter, clothing, transportation, healthcare, and entertainment.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=27&annotation=TA9NWILS))
	- We acquire these items by buying them.
	- You afford the things you buy by working for pay.
		- If you do not, someone else does on your behalf. 
	- Most of us never have enough income to buy the things we want because of scarcity.
- Read [this](https://stateimpact.npr.org/texas/2013/08/02/how-10-western-cities-are-dealing-with-water-scarcity-and-drought/) to see how the United States is dealing with scarcity in resources
	- #question I should read the above article
- Every society at every level must make choices about how to use its [[resources]]
	- Families decide on new car or fancy vacation
	- Towns choose budget for police and fire protection or into school system
	- Nations choose between funding national defense or protecting the environment
- “In most cases, there just isn’t enough money in the budget to do everything.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=27&annotation=AUNEEFBF))
- “How do we use our limited resources the best way possible, that is, to obtain the most goods and services we can?” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=27&annotation=B8QIHGPX))
	- We each could produce everything we consume
	- “we could each produce some of what we want to consume, and “trade” for the rest of what we want.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=27&annotation=6A9JG8FA))
- Why do we not just produce all the things we consumer?
	- During the pioneer days, individuals knew how to
		- Build their homes
		- Grow their crops
		- Hunt for food
		- Repair their equipment
- Most of us do not know how to do these things not because we could not learn but because we do not have to.
	- Reason why is called [[the division and specialization of labor]], a production innovation first put forth by [[Adam Smith]] in his book, [[The Wealth of Nations]]
		- #question what is a production innovation?
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-11-07 at 2.53.16 AM.png|200]]
		- “Adam Smith introduced the idea of dividing labor into discrete tasks” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=28&annotation=NNVK6MHL))

#### The Division of and Specialization of Labor
- “The formal study of [[economics]] began when [[Adam Smith]] (1723–1790) published his famous book [[The Wealth of Nations]] 1776.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=28&annotation=8Z9QZHM2))
	- “Many authors had written on economics in the centuries before Smith, but he was the first to address the subject in a comprehensive way.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RPVTIFRU?page=28&annotation=9LP2MCKB))
- In the first chapter, he introduces the concept [[division of labor]]
