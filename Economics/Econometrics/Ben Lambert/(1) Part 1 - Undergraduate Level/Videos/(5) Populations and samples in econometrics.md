	- [[population]] (encompasses all objects which have those particular characteristics)
		- Examples
			- Under 18 individuals in UK
			- Smokers
			- Products
		- Might postulate there is a linear relationship between education and wages in population
			- [[Population process]]
				- When summing together individual processes, we get a population process. In this example, $\beta$ represents the average effect which one year of education has on wages. Known as population process
	- [[sample]]
		- When we aggregate each of the individual effects of education on wages, we get the [[sample analog]] of the population process
			- We observe $\beta ^S$ as being the sample analog of the population parameter
		- Our sample analog of population and effect on education will be different to what we observe in the population
			- $B^S \ne B^P$ 
				- Reason behind difference between [[sample parameter]] and [[population parameter]] is due to [[sampling error]] (as a result of taking sample from population, which by definition is a subset of the population, characteristics will be different )
	- [[Econometrics]] about how we come up with estimates of population parameter from our samples. How to get good estimate of the effect of education on wages as a whole for under 18 population in UK given we only have a sample of 1000 people
