	- Estimating population parameters from a sample
		- [[Estimators]]
		- Must use sample data to estimate population parameter
			- Will use something called estimators
		- For [[estimators]]
			- Will feed in some sort of sample data as input to $\overset\wedge\beta$. Will output estimate of population parameter ($\beta ^*)$ 
				- Usually use hats $(\wedge)$ when talking about estimators
			- [[estimator]]
				- Some kind of mathematical function
					- $\overset \wedge \beta$ 
				- Need to figure out properties for good estimator
			- [[Point estimate]] of population parameter
				- $\beta^*$ 
					- This is typically a value (such as $50)
