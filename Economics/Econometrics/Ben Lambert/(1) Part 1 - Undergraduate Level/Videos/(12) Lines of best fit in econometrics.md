	- [[Line of best fit]]
	- There is most likely a [[positive correlation]] between years of education and wages
	- Can we draw a line which fits our data pretty well?
		- The slope of line tells us what is the average effect of one more year of education on weekly wages for someone in population
			- Slope of line given by $\beta^P$ 
				- This is because we talked about there being a linear relationship between wages and years of education
			- $\text{wages} = \alpha + \beta^P \text{educ}$ 
				- This is the population process
				- For y = mx + c
					- m = $\beta^P$ 
	- If we use $\beta^S$, we will get a [[sampling error]] since it does not fully represent exactly what is going on in the population process
	- We need an objective way of coming up of estimate of $\beta^P$ which is realized in $\beta^S$ 
		- This is when we think of methodologies for drawing a line of best fit
			- We're typically talking about [[estimators]]
