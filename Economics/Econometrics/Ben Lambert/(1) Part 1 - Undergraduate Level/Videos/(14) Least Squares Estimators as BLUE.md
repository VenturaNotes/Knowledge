	- [[Least squares estimator]] (they're good)
	- A population may have an underlying process which connects wages with education
		- Will use tools (mathematical functions) on sample to make inferences about what is going on in population
			- Trying to come up with estimates of $\alpha^S$ and $\beta^S$ from some sort of method we apply to the sample
	- Take repeated samples from population
		- Create a [[frequency distribution]] which is given output from least square estimator $\overset \wedge B$ 
			- Frequency distribution centered around true population parameter $\beta ^P$ this property is called being [[unbiased]]
		- When increasing sample size, we'll get closer to the true population value more frequently
			- [[consistency]]
		- $\overset \wedge \beta$ is more [[efficient]] because it gets closer to the true [[population parameter]] ($\beta^P$) more of the time than $\overset \sim \beta$ because it has a wider sampling distribution than $\overset \wedge \beta$ 
	- Under a set of conditions called the [[Gaussâ€“Markov Assumptions]], (named after [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Andrey Markov]])
		- [[Least squares estimator|least square estimators]] are referred to as [[BLUE]]
			- B means they are the best estimators (efficiency)
				- No other unbiased estimators which are more efficient than least square estimators. (and they are consistent even though they're not mentioned in mnemonic)
			- L means Linear
			- U stands for unbiased
			- E stands for estimators
		- Under the Gauss-Markov Assumptions, the least squares estimators are the best linear unbiased estimators
	- BLUE is a property we really like
		- This means there are no other efficient linear estimators which we can apply to our samples
		- [[Econometrics]] concerned with when one of these assumptions fails and what should we do about it
	- Least square estimators under a set of conditions turn out to be a really good tool to use to make inferences about a population
