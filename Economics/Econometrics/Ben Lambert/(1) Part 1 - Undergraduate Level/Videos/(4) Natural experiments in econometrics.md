	- [[Natural experiment]]
	- Lifetime income = f(military participation, Lifetime income potential)
		- LIP can be affected by education and innate ability
	- [[Selection bias]]
		- Individuals which participated in a quasi-experiment might be a different type of individual to those part of control group (civilians)
	- [[Joshua Angrist]]
		- Professor at MIT
		- Did [[empirical research]] in 1990
			- Looked at Vietnam. What effect of military participation had on those individuals LIP
		- Draft process was a natural experiment
			- People were assigned a number through conscription process in 1969
			- Numbers corresponded to birthday
				- If 2 was pulled out of box, all individuals born on Jan 2nd would be conscripted to drafted to join military
					- This process was completely independent of individual's LIP 
		- This experiment got rid of the selection bias
			- Individuals who joined the military here was completely independent of LIP
			- It was a sort of quasi-experiment which came about as a result of the draft process
		- Will talk more about specifics of this research when talking about [[instrumental variables estimation]]
		- A [[natural experiment]] is an experiment which resulted as a result of some action occurring so it could be human or it could be something from Nature.
			- It just means experimental conditions resulted from something else happening
