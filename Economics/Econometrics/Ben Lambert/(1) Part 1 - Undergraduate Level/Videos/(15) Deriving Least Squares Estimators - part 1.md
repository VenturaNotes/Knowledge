	- Deriving [[least squares estimator]] of $\overset \wedge \alpha$, $\overset \wedge \beta$ for the case of a [[bivariate]] model
	- The different sums we can minimize
		- Modulus function
		- Squares function
		- Power Four
	- Least squares sum
		- $\overset \wedge \alpha$ is the y-intercept
		- $\overset \wedge \beta$  is the slope
	- [[Differentiate]]
	- We square it because we care as much about over predicting as we do about under predicting
	- Can derive first order conditions (FOCs) for $\overset \wedge \alpha$, $\overset \wedge \beta$
