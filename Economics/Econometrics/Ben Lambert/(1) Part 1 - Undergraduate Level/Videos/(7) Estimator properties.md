	- Properties of [[estimators]]
	- In econometrics, we're thinking about a population with some sort of process ($\beta ^P$) and population parameter which quantifies the effect of the variable which we're considering within the population
		- Will take repeated samples from population
	- Will use [[estimator]] to come up with estimates of [[population parameter]]
		- $\beta ^*$ 
	- Each estimate will not equal exactly the population parameter due to [[sampling error]]
		- This is because each of the samples isn't quite representative of exactly what's going on in population
	- [[Frequency plot]] (of all different values of $\beta^*$ which we got from applying our estimator to repeated samples )
		- Might have 10 instances of $\beta^*_1$ and 3 instances of $\beta_2^*$ 
		- We hope on average that our estimator outputs the population parameter
			- Signified in frequency graph by having a maximum when $\beta^*$ equals $\beta^P$ 
		- Mathematically $E(\overset \wedge \beta)$ = $\beta ^P$ 
			- Expectation of our estimators (function) is equal to the population parameter
			- This property is called [[unbiased]]
		- Second property is called [[consistency]] of estimators
			- By increasing sample size, the value we get for $\beta^*$ get closer and closer to the true population parameter
				- As we increase sample size arbitrarily, we hope we wouldn't get a distribution but a line at $\beta^P$ 
			- As n $\to$ $\infty$
				- $\overset \wedge \beta \to \beta^P$ 
					- As our sample size tends to infinity, our estimator tends in value to true population parameter
		- Third property of estimators is [[efficiency]]
