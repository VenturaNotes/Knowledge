- A clocked flip-flop having a single D input (see diagram). The flip-flop Q output will take on the current state of the D input only when a given transition of the clock signal occurs between its two logic states, i.e. from low to high voltage level (positive-edge triggered) or from high to low level (negative-edge triggered).
