- Revenue assurance is the application of a process or software to enable a communications service provider (CSP) to examine its revenue. It allows a CSP, such as a telephone company, to identify and fix actual or potential financial losses throughout its network and customer-facing systems. Revenue assurance lets a CSP correct errors in real-time and also correct revenue data before it reaches a billing system. Revenue assurance might merge into other business functions such as risk management and network assurance.
