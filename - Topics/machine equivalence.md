## Source [^1]
- The property describing two usually abstract machines that can simulate one another. Machines $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ are said to be equivalent if $M_{1}$ can simulate $M_{2}$ and $M_{2}$ can simulate $M_{1}$. Given precise definitions of the machines, precise definitions of simulation can be formulated. See also MACHINE SIMULATION.
