- $n$. A relation between perceived space and time, demonstrated most simply by placing three light sources $A, B$, and $C$ at different positions, with $A$ and $B$ closer together than $B$ and $C$, and then flashing the lights successively in the dark, with equal time intervals between the three flashes, creating the space-time illusion that the time interval between $A$ and $B$ is shorter than that between $B$ and C. Compare tau EFFECT.
