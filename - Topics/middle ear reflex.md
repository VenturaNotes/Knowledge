- involuntary contraction of the stapedius and/or tensor tympani muscles in the middle ear in response to various stimuli. The stapedius contracts in response to sound (see STAPEDIAL REFLEX). The tensor tympani is thought to contract during chewing. The sound-evoked middle ear reflex can be detected using a tympanometer.
