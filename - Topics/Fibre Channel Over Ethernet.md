- Fibre Channel Over Ethernet (or FCoE, for short) is a technology that enables Fibre Channel (FC) communications overÂ enhanced Ethernet, a type of internet connection that improves connectivity and scalability for companies. FC allows storage devices such as hard drives to transfer data to computers via enhanced Ethernet. FCoE makes the transfer of data between storage devices and computers easier. FCoE helps enhanced Ethernet connections transport data at speeds of 10 Gbps or greater (that's faster than Wi-Fi) without cabling, adapters, or switches.
