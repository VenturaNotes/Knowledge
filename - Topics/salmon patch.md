- (stork mark) a malformation of the skin in young children consisting of dilated capillaries resulting in a light pink patch, usually on the face or back of the neck, with poorly defined borders. The patch becomes more intense in colour when the child is crying. Most lesions disappear within the first year of life but those on the nape of the neck tend to be more persistent and in some cases may remain for life.
