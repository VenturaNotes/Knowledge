aliases: Proof by contradiction
---
## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
$$\begin{align*}  \lnot p \implies q \\ \text{Therefore, p} \end{align*}$$
- If assuming a statement is false leads to a contradiction, then the initial statement must be true

## Source[^2]
- The simultaneous assertion of both the truth of a proposition and its negation. Since both cannot be true there must necessarily be a flaw in either the reasoning leading to the simultaneous assertion or in the assumptions on which the deductive reasoning is based. It is this latter situation which provides the basis for proof by contradiction.
