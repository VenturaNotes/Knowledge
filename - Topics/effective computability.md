is effectively computable if there is an effective procedure or algorithm that correctly calculates $f$. An effective procedure is one that meets the following specifications. Firstly, the procedure must consist of a finite set of 'simple' instructions and there must be no ambiguity concerning the order in which the instructions are to be carried out. Secondly, if the procedure is given a $k$-tuple $x$ in the domain of $f$, then after a finite number of steps, the calculation must terminate and output $f(x)$; if the procedure is given a $k$-tuple not in the domain of $f$ it must not output a value.
