- A proxy server is a gateway between computer users and the internet. This intermediary server separates end users from the websites they want to browse. It helps prevent cyberattackers from accessing private networks. Proxy servers can also be set up as web filters or firewalls to block malware from entering computer systems.
- When a user sends a web request, it first goes to the proxy server, which then makes the web request on the user's behalf, collects the results from the web server, and forwards the web page data to the user so they can see the page in their browser. This process conceals the user's IP address from being accessed by internet servers, which assists as a security precaution.
