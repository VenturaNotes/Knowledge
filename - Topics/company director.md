- A member of a company's board of directors. Directors may be executive, that is, full- or part-time employees of the company, or non-executive. Non-executive directors are chosen either for their specialized knowledge and experience, or because their title or reputation is thought to confer respectability. The duties of directors are laid down by law, and their qualifications in the UK are laid down in the Company Directors Disqualification Act.
