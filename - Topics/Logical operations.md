## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Gives new [[Proposition|logical statements]]
### Examples
- [[Negation]]
	- Given A, the negation would be $\lnot A$ which is read as "not A"
- [[Conjunction]]:
	- For two logical statements A, B
		- $A \land B$ denotes the conjunction
		- This is true when A and B are true simultaneously

## Source[^2]
- Given [[Proposition|logical statements]]: $\lnot A$ and $A \land B$ 
	- A and B are considered [[logical variables]]
	- $\lnot$ and $\land$ are considered logical operations
		- $\lnot$: Not operation
		- $\land$: And operation
- More logical operations:
	- [[Disjunction]]
		- $A \lor B$ denotes disjunctions meaning "or"
		- At least one of the logical variables needs to be true

## Source[^3]
- [[Implication|Conditional]] (aka implication)
	- A $\to$ B
		- If A, then B
- [[Biconditional]] (normal conditional in both directions)
	- A $\leftrightarrow$ B
		- A if and only if B
		- Truth value on both sides should coincide meaning both need to be true or both need to be false for this logical statement to be true
		- $\iff$ would imply a [[tautology]]
