- $n$. Any form of information processing requiring conscious attention or control, as in the performance of a novel or difficult task. Compared to automatic processing, controlled processing is generally much slower, requires more effort, is more easily impaired by fatigue or alcohol, and does not normally involve parallel processing of information from more than one sensory channel, but it can be developed faster and with less practice than automatic processing, often in a few trials, and it leaves the learner with greater control of the behavior. See also dual-PROCESS MODEL, MINDFULNESS, PRINCIPLE OF LEAST EFFORT.
