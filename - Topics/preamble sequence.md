- The set of signals preceding genuine data in a transmission. The term is most commonly used in connection with Ethernet (CSMA/CD) signaling, where each packet is preceded by a sequence of alternate 1 s and 0 s to allow the receiving system to synchronize its local clock with that of the transmitter.
