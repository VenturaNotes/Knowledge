- Describing animals that excrete nitrogenous waste in the form of urea. Most terrestrial vertebrates are ureotelic, converting ammonium ions formed during the breakdown of amino acids into urea by the urea cycle in the liver. In teleost fishes and many invertebrates, urea is formed from uric acid via the uricolytic pathway. Compare AMMONOTELIC; URICOTELIC.
