- (IFA) A person or firm defined under the Financial Services Act 1986 as an adviser on pensions, investments, or life assurance who is not committed to the products of any company or organization. Such a person or firm is now licensed to operate by the Financial Conduct Authority. With no loyalties except to the customer, the IFA is bound legally to give 'best advice' on products from the whole of the market. This distinguishes the IFA from both a tied adviser, who advises on products from a single provider, and a multi-tied adviser, who is committed to a selection of providers. New rules introduced at the end of 2012 state that independent financial advisers selling investment products (including pensions, life policies, and unit trusts) must now charge an upfront fee for their advice rather than taking payment in the form of commission. This does not apply to mortgages or insurance products. See also POLARIZATION.
