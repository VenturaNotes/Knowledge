- Pareto distribution A continuous distribution of the form$$f(x)=\beta \alpha^{\beta} /\left(x^{\beta+1}\right)$$for $\alpha<x<\infty$ and $\alpha>0, \beta>0$. It is commonly used to model the distribution of wealth across individuals; in this case $\beta$ is called the Pareto index and is inversely related to the Gini coefficient, $G=1 /(2 \beta-1)$, so that the smaller values of $\beta$ correspond to a more unequal distribution. The Pareto distribution has a finite mean if $\beta>1$ and a finite variance if $\beta>2$.
