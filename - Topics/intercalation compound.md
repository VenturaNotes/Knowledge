- A type of compound in which atoms, ions, or molecules are trapped between layers in a crystal lattice. There is no formal chemical bonding between the host crystal and the trapped molecules (see also ). Such compounds are formed by lamellar solids and are often nonstoichiometric; examples are graphitic oxide (graphiteâ€“oxygen) and the mineral muscovite.
