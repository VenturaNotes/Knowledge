- a disorder of young children characterized by the passage of frequent loose, offensive, and bulky stools in which partially digested or undigested food may be visible (the 'peas and carrot' stool). There is no other definable abnormality and the children gain weight normally. Management consists of excluding other causes of diarrhoea and reassurance that the disorder is benign and self-limiting (it resolves by school age).
