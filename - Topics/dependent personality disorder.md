- $n$. A personality disorder in DSM-5 characterized by a pervasive and excessive need to be taken care of, leading to submissive, clinging behavior and separation anxiety, beginning by early adulthood and indicated by such signs and symptoms as difficulty making everyday decisions without advice and reassurance from others; a need for others to assume responsibility for major areas of life; difficulty expressing disagreement with others for fear of disapproval or loss of support; difficulty initiating projects or doing things alone; tendency to go to excessive lengths to gain nurturance or support; fear of being unable to cope when alone; urgent seeking of a new relationship as a source of care and support as soon as one ends; and unrealistic preoccupation with fears of being left to cope alone.
