## Source [^1]
- A protocol used to allow the transmission of network management information across a network, between a network management centre and the devices that constitute the active switches within the network. The active devices must therefore be able to act as addressable entities on the network. See also MANAGED DEVICE.
## Source[^2]
- Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is a network protocol that monitors network elements. This includes modems, routers, computers, and more. It consists of two basic components, an agent and a network management station. This allows computers to connect to other devices. It also creates a way in which internet connectivity can be monitored and enables users to diagnose problems.
