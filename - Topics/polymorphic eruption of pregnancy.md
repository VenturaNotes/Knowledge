- (PEP) intensely itchy papules and weals on the abdomen (except the umbilicus), upper limbs, and buttocks, usually within the striae gravidarum; it is also known as PUPPP (pruritic urticarial papules and plaques of pregnancy). It occurs in 1 in 250 first pregnancies late in the third trimester. This condition is harmless to mother and baby, but can be very annoying. It lasts an average of 6 weeks and resolves spontaneously 1-2 weeks after delivery. The most severe itching normally lasts for no more than a week.
