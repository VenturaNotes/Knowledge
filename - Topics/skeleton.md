- $n$. the rigid framework of connected bones that gives form to the body, protects and supports its soft organs and tissues, and provides attachments for muscles and a system of levers essential for locomotion. The 206 named bones of the body are organized into the axial skeleton (of the head and trunk) and the appendicular skeleton (of the limbs). See illustration overleaf. $\textemdash$skeletal adj.

## Source[^2]
- The structure in an animal that provides mechanical support for the body, protection for internal organs, and a framework for anchoring the muscles. The skeleton may be external (see EXOSKELETON) or internal (see ENDOSKELETON). Both types require joints to allow locomotion. The skeleton of higher vertebrates consists of a system of bones (see APPENDICULAR SKELETON; AXIAL SKELETON). Soft-bodied animals have a hydrostatic skeleton.
