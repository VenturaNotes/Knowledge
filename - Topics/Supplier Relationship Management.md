- SRM refers to the relationship between a supplier and a buyer. Buyers need to assess a supplier to ensure they can meet their business needs, which includes the quality of products or services and how quickly they can be deployed. But it also includes customer service and sustainable logistics. From the supplierâ€™s perspective, buyers must pay on time or have good credit. There must be open and clear communication on both sides of the relationship.
