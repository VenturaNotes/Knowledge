- (1) a device to ensure a supply of fresh air. 
- (2) (respirator) equipment that is manually or mechanically operated to maintain a flow of air into and out of the lungs of a patient who is unable to breathe normally. Positive-pressure ventilators blow air into the patient's lungs; air is released from the lungs when the pressure from the ventilator is relaxed (see BiPAP; Nippy; noninvasive ventilation). Negative-pressure ventilators are airtight containers in which the air pressure is decreased and increased mechanically. This draws air into and out of the patient's lungs through the normal air passages. The original devices, known colloquially as iron lungs, had a seal around the neck and enclosed the whole body except the head. They have been replaced by cuirass ventilators, which work on a similar principle but enclose the chest only; there may be a role for these in adults and children with claustrophobia.
