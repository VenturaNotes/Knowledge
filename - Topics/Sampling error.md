- Any difference between the true parameters of a population and a conclusion about these parameters based on a sample of the population. Sampling errors are of two kinds. The first, which is inevitable, arises from the laws of statistics and probability, which enable a margin of error to be calculated. The second, which is preventable, arises from inadequate or unrepresentative sampling techniques (see SELECTION ERROR). Compare NON-SAMPLING ERRORS.
