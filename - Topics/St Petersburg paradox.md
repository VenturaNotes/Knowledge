- The observation that experimental subjects will only offer to pay a small fee to enter a coin-tossing game with an expected pay-off that is infinite. Consider being offered the chance to play in a game in which a fair coin is repeatedly tossed until a tail appears. If the first tail appears on the $t$th toss the pay-off is $2^{t-1}$. The expected pay-off from entering the game is$$EP = \frac 122^0 + \frac 142^1+ \frac 18 2^2 + \ldots = \frac 12 + \frac 12 + \frac 12 + \ldots = \infty.$$The fact that most subjects are willing to pay only a small fee to enter the game can be explained by the diminishing marginal utility of money. There are stronger paradoxes that can be explained only by bounded utility or behavioral economics. See also ANOMALIES.
