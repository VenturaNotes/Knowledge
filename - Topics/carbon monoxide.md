## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- a colorless almost odourless gas that is very poisonous. When breathed in it combines with haemoglobin in the red blood cells to form carboxyhaemoglobin, which is bright red in color. This compound is chemically stable and thus the haemoglobin can no longer combine with oxygen. Carbon monoxide is present in coal gas and motor exhaust fumes. Formula: CO.
## Source[^2]
- A colorless odorless gas, CO. It is formed by the incomplete combustion of carbon and is present in car-exhaust gases. Carbon monoxide is able to bond with metals; this accounts for its toxicity, which is due to the binding of the CO to the iron in haemoglobin, thereby blocking the uptake of oxygen. In vertebrates small amounts of CO are produced naturally by the enzyme haem oxygenase as a by-product of haem degradation. The gas acts as a neurotransmitter and signaling molecule, and it is also thought to modulate functions of the cardiovascular system and to inhibit the aggregation of platelets. See CARBOXYHAEMOGLOBIN.
