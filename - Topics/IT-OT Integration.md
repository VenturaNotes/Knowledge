- IT/OT integration combines information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) departments into a single technology system. IT involves managing data and digital information through computers, software, and networks within an organization, while OT involves monitoring and controlling devices, machinery, and processes in industrial companies. When IT and OT are merged, processes and information flows are streamlined.
