- A property of a function of one or several variables such that a uniform relative change in all of its arguments results in an equal relative change in the value of the function; also referred to as linear homogeneity. For example, a Cobb-Douglas production function exhibits constant returns to scale when the elasticities of all inputs with respect to output sum up to one. Formally, consider the function $f\left(x_{1}, \ldots\right.$, $\left.x_{n}\right)$. If the function satisfies the assumption of constant returns to scale then$$f\left(\lambda x_{1}, \ldots, \lambda x_{n}\right)=\lambda f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$$for any $\lambda \geq 0$.
