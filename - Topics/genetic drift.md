- The tendency for variations to occur in the genetic composition of small isolated inbreeding populations by chance. Such populations become genetically rather different from the original population from which they were derived.
## Source[^2]
- (Sewall Wright effect) The random change in the frequency of alleles in a population over successive generations due to sampling error in the gametes. Each new generation differs from its parental generation with regard to allele frequencies simply because of random variation in the distribution of gametes. Over time, this may lead to certain alleles becoming fixed and others being lost altogether. This process is more rapid in smaller populations, following a population bottleneck, or when the alleles concerned confer no apparent benefit compared to their counterparts. Hence, genetic drift can ultimately cause loss of genetic diversity if there are no counteracting factors.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Change in the relative frequencies of genes in a population resulting not from natural selection but from neutral mutation. Also called non-Darwinian evolution or random drift. See also Darwinian evolution, NATURAL SELECTION. Compare FOUNDER EFFECT.
