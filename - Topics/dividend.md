- The payment of a share in the profits of a company to its shareholders. Dividends are so called because a company is legally required to divide any sum available for distribution between its shareholders in proportion to the number of shares held. The sum to be paid out in dividends is chosen by the board of directors. Most companies prefer to slowly increase dividends over time because any decrease in dividends is seen as a bad signal on financial markets. Cooperative society dividends are payments to customers who are members, the total sum available being divided between customers in proportion to the value of their purchases. See also CUM DIVIDEND; EX DIVIDEND; STOCK DIVIDEND.

- (1) The distribution of part of the earnings of a company to its shareholders. The dividend is normally expressed as an amount per share on the par value of the share. Thus a $15 \%$ dividend on a $£ 1$ share will pay 15 p . However, investors are usually more interested in the dividend yield, i.e. the dividend expressed as a percentage of the share value; thus if the market value of these $£ 1$ shares is now $£ 5$, the dividend yield would be $1 / 5 \times 15 \%=$ $3 \%$. The size of the dividend payment is determined by the board of directors of a company, who must decide how much to pay out to shareholders and how much to retain in the business; these amounts may vary from year to year. In the UK it is usual for companies to pay a dividend every six months, the largest portion (the final dividend) being announced at the company's AGM together with the annual financial results. A smaller interim dividend usually accompanies the interim statement of the company's affairs, six months before the AGM. In the USA dividends are usually paid quarterly. See also DIVIDEND COVER; YIELD.
- Interest payments on gilt-edged securities are also sometimes called dividends although they are fixed. 
- (2) A payment made out of profits by a co-operative society to its members. It is usually related to the amount the member spends and is expressed as a number of pence in the pound.
