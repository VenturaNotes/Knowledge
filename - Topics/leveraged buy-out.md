- (LBO) The acquisition of one company by another through the use of borrowed funds. The intention is that the loans will be repaid from the cash flow of the acquired company. In the 1980s many takeovers in the USA were financed by the issue of junk bonds in highly leveraged buyouts. More recently, LBOs have become associated with the activities of private equity firms.
## Source[^2]
- A buy-out of the equity of a firm largely financed by borrowing. This is risky for the purchasers, as interest on the loan will absorb a large proportion of any operating profits. If the firm does badly, this may leave nothing for the equity holders.
