## Source [^1]
- A new industry that may merit some protection against foreign competition in the short term. The argument in favor of providing protection, say in the form of a tariff on imported competitors' goods, is that it would provide a period during which the new industry could streamline its process and make the necessary economies in order for it to become truly competitive with all market producers.
## Source[^2]
- A new industry which during its early stages is unable to compete with established producers abroad, often because of the lack of market reputation and small scale. Governments sometimes support the development of infant industries either by direct subsidies, or by protective tariffs or other trade controls.
