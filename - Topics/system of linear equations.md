## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
- When solving and 0 = 0, it means you have an infinite number of solutions
	- This is not necessarily always true [^2]
- If 0 = -3, it means you have no solution because a contradiction was found [^3]

## Source[^4]
- A system of linear equations is a collection of two or more linear equations using the same variables
	- Solving this using a [[matrix]] is much easier with more variables

	- Types of systems
		- [[Inconsistent System]]
			- No solution (equations never touch)
		- [[Consistent System]]
			- [[One Solution]]
				- Could be an ordered pair, ordered triple, or however many values you have
			- [[Infinitely many solutions]] (Identical lines)
				- Each point on the line is a solution to both equations
