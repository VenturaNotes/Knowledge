- (print format) The format for printed output, defining the character and line spacing and the areas of the page where printing will occur. The format aspect that is often different for each job involves the lines on which printing is not required; this is controlled by a vertical format unit. Modern serial and page printers allow the host system to control all aspects of the format by the use of control codes or page description languages.
