- adj. 
- (1) Of or relating to muscles that are abnormally tensed. Compare hypotonic (1), isotonic (1). 
- (2) Of or relating to a solution having a greater concentration than another and hence exerting more osmotic pressure than the other. A hypertonic saline solution (more than 0.9 per cent) is more concentrated than the intracellular fluid, so that cells shrink when immersed in it. See also osmosis. Compare hypotonic (2), isotonic (2). \[From Greek hyper over + tonos tension + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
