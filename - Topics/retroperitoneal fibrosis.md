- (RPF) a condition in which a dense plaque of fibrous tissue develops behind the peritoneum adjacent to the abdominal aorta. It may be secondary to malignancy, medication (methysergide, beta blockers), aortic aneurysm, or certain infections. The ureters become encased and hence obstructed, causing acute anuria and renal failure. The obstruction can be relieved by nephrostomy or the insertion of double J stents. In the acute phase steroid administration may help, but in established RPF ureterolysis is required.
