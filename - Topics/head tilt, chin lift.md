- a manoeuvre for opening the airway of an unconscious patient. With the patient lying on his or her back, the neck is extended and the chin simultaneously pulled gently upwards to pull the tongue away from the back of the pharynx. This method is often used when mouth-to-mouth ventilation is to be given and is an alternative to the jaw thrust manoeuvre.
