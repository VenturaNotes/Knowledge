- Consumerization refers to a trend in which new technologies first emerge for the use of consumers or end-users before spreading to enterprise IT. Some well-known instances of consumerization include the use of laptops and smartphones at work, as well as the adoption of cloud storage and social media (for marketing purposes). Appleâ€™s iPhone, for example, was first introduced to the consumer market before seeing widespread adoption by business users as a better alternative to company-provided PDAs. Traditionally, new technology products were first developed by governments and large enterprises before seeing general availability. Consumerization is a relatively new phenomenon and marks a major shift in the IT field.
