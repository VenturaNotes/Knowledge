- $n$. A technique of psychoanalysis in which the analyst presents interpretations (2) to the patient bluntly, attempting to communicate directly with the patient's unconscious (2). For example, the analyst might interpret a male patient's Oedipus complex by telling him: 'You want to fuck your mother and cut your father's balls off'. It was introduced in 1946 by the US psychoanalyst John N(athaniel) Rosen (1902-83), who claimed that it was especially effective in treating schizophrenia, in which the unconscious overwhelms the patient's defences, but in the early 1980s it became enveloped in controversy and Rosen stopped practising it. The technique is discussed in detail in Rosen's book Direct Analysis: Selected Papers (1953).
