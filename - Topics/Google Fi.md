- Google Fi is a cell phone carrier operated by Google that intelligently switches between the LTE and 5G services of two mobile networks: T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular. This telecommunications service also uses Wi-Fi to send and receive calls and texts when available to provide users with optimal coverage. Phones that use Google Fi but are not specifically designed for Fi can only receive service from T-Mobileâ€™s network.
- Google Fi puts a strong emphasis on privacy and security features, adding secure VPNs to its three-tier pricing plan. All calls made using Google Fi and an Android phone automatically feature end-to-end call encryption when chatting with other Google Fi customers. Google Fi is compatible with select Apple, Samsung, LG, Motorola, Huawei, OnePlus, and other cell phone models. If a cell phone model does not support CDMA radio technology, it will not be able to connect to Google Fi.
