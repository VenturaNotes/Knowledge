- a leak of the aortic valve resulting in reflux of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle during diastole. Aortic regurgitation is most commonly due to degenerative 'wear and tear' of the aortic valve. Other causes include dilatation of the aortic root with secondary dilatation of the aortic valve, scarring of the aortic valve as a result of previous acute rheumatic fever, or destruction of the valve by infection (see ENDOCARDITIS). Mild cases are symptom-free, but patients more severely affected develop breathlessness, angina pectoris, and enlargement of the heart; all have a diastolic murmur. A badly affected valve may be replaced surgically with a prosthesis.
