- A form of PAL in which the programming information is held in a SIPO (serial in, parallel out) shift register, so that the mode of operation of the device can be read into it when the system of which it is a part is started up. The contents of the register, and therefore the mode of operation of the LCA, remain unchanged while the system is running.
