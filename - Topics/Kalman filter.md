## Source [^1]
- A mathematical estimation technique used to predict the behavior of a system from observations that contain noise. Used in applications involving tracking, prediction, or forecasting, it is particularly useful in navigation of autonomous vehicles or robots.
## Source[^2]
- A recursive algorithm for optimal estimation (minimization of the mean squared error) and prediction of state variables generated by a stochastic process. The estimator is based on the currently available information and allows the estimate to be updated when new observations become available.
