- A specification of the design of particular goods or components. Examples range from the gauges of screw on nuts and bolts to the voltages of electronic equipment. Technical standards are needed to ensure compatibility. The use of technical standards is an example of network externalities, where everybody gains from their equipment being compatible with everybody else's. In the early days of a new product, there is a considerable competitive advantage to a firm that can get its own design accepted as the technical standard.
