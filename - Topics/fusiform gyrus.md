- $n$. A spindle-shaped gyrus on the medial (inside) surface of each temporal lobe, at the junction with the occipital lobe, occupied by Area V4 of the visual cortex, largely responsible for color perception and also implicated in face recognition. The left fusiform gyrus is involved in word recognition in reading, and lesions in that region are associated with spelling dyslexia. It is sometimes taken to include a region that is adjacent and anterior to this and is involved in object perception. \[From Latin fusus a spindle + forma a shape + Greek gyros a circle or ring]
