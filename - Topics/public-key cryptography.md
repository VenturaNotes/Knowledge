- Public-key cryptography is a way of encrypting data. It’s also called asymmetric cryptography because two different encryption keys are used. A public key is used to encrypt the data. Any number of people could have this key. It can only be used to encrypt data, so it doesn’t matter if it’s shared. A different key is needed to decrypt the data—this is a private key and no one but the recipient of the data has access to this.
