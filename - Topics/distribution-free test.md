- $n$. In inferential statistics, any significance test that makes no assumptions about the precise distribution or form of the sampled population. Although the term distribution-free is often used interchangeably with non-parametric, strictly speaking it is possible for a test to be distribution-free without being non-parametric; for example the sign test makes no assumptions about the distribution of the sampled population but tests the hypothesis that a certain parameter of the binomial distribution (the proportion of successes) is $1 / 2$, so it is not really non-parametric. See also NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICS, PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTION.
