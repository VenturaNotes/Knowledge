- A serial version of the parallel ATA interface widely used for hard disk attachment. Serial ATA supports data transfer rates up to 300 Mbytes/s and enhancements up to 600 Mbytes/s are planned. Cables are much smaller than the flat ribbon cables used conventionally and can be up to two meters long. Serial ATA is compatible with existing IDE standards by emulation.
