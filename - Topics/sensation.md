- $n$. a feeling: the result of messages from the body's sensory receptors registering in the brain as information about the environment. Messages from exteroceptors are interpreted as specific sensations $\textendash$ smell, taste, temperature, pain, etc. $\textendash$ in the conscious mind. Messages from interoceptors, however, rarely reach the consciousness to produce sensation.
## Source[^2]
- The raw data detected by the senses. For example, red is a colour sensation. Compare PERCEPTION.
