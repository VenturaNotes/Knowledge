- A model in which the leadership style of a manager is described on two dimensions: concern for production and concern for people. Leadership behavior is measured on a 9-point scale along each dimension, so that there is a total of 81 possible styles. These range from laissez-faire (production 1, people 1) to authoritarian (production 9, people 1) and country club (production 1, people 9), with the optimum score (production 9 , people 9 ) representing true team leadership. The BlakeMouton grid has often been used as the basis for organizational interventions designed to improve the performance of managers on both dimensions (a grid organizational development). It was devised by the US psychologists Robert R. Blake and Jane S. Mouton. See also RELATIONSHIP-MOTIVATED; TASK-MOTIVATED.
