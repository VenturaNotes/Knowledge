- Neurons that contain acetylcholine are called [[cholinergic]]

- (ACh) One of the main neurotransmitters of the vertebrate nervous system. It is released at certain (cholinergic) nerve endings and may be excitatory or inhibitory; it initiates muscular contraction at neuromuscular junctions and controls many physiological functions via the parasympathetic nervous system. Acetylcholine promotes contraction of smooth muscle in the gut, whereas it has an inhibitory effect on cardiac muscle, reducing heart rate. It also has a role in various brain activities, including attentiveness, aggression, sex drive, and thirst. Acetylcholine receptors (cholinoceptors) fall into two main classes, muscarinic and nicotinic receptors; hence acetylcholine can have different effects in different tissues, depending on the type of receptor. Once acetylcholine has been released it has only a transitory effect because it is rapidly broken down by the enzyme cholinesterase.

- n. A neurotransmitter substance secreted from the ends of many neurons and functioning as the main chemical messenger for motor neurons in the peripheral nervous system, including the autonomic nervous system, and as a significant neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, functioning to excite skeletal muscles and to inhibit cardiac muscle, remaining in existence only long enough for the impulse to cross from one cell to another before being broken down by acetylcholinesterase into acetic acid and choline. See also Alzheimer's DISEASE, CARBACHOL, CHOLINERGIC, CHOLINOMIMETIC, MUSCARINE, MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR, NICOTINIC RECEPTOR, VAGUSSTOFF. ACh abbrev. \[From Latin acetum vinegar + Greek hyle wood or material + chole bile + -ine indicating an organic compound]
## Source[^4]
- $n$. the acetic acid ester of the organic base choline: the neurotransmitter released at the synapses of parasympathetic nerves and at neuromuscular junctions. After relaying a nerve impulse, acetylcholine is rapidly broken down by the enzyme cholinesterase. Antimuscarinic drugs block the action of acetylcholine at receptor sites; anticholinesterases and acetylcholinesterase inhibitors prolong the activity of acetylcholine by blocking cholinesterase.
- A pharmaceutical preparation of acetylcholine is instilled into the anterior chamber of the eye as a miotic during intraocular surgery.
