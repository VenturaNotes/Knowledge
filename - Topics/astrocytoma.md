- $n$. a brain tumor derived from non-nervous cells (glia), which - unlike the neurons - retain the ability to reproduce themselves by mitosis. All grades of malignancy occur, from slow-growing tumors whose histological structure resembles normal glial cells, to rapidly growing highly invasive tumors whose cell structure is poorly differentiated (including anaplastic astrocytoma and glioblastoma). In adults astrocytomas are usually found in the cerebral hemispheres but in children they also occur in the cerebellum.
