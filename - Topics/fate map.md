- A diagram that depicts embryological development, showing the adult structures that develop from the different parts of the embryo. For example, the individual cells (blastomeres) of a blastula can be color-coded according to which of the three germ layers they will form$\textemdash$ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm$\textemdash$and thus ultimately which tissues they give rise to.
