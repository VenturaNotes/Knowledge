- a disorder of the eyes in which the pupillary reflex is absent. Although the pupils contract normally for near vision (the accommodation reflex), they fail to contract in bright light. It may occur, for example, as a result of syphilis or diabetes. \[D. Argyll Robertson (1837-1909), Scottish ophthalmologist]
