- $n$. distension and dilatation of the pelvis of the kidney. This is due to an obstruction to the free flow of urine from the kidney. An obstruction at or below the neck of the bladder will result in hydronephrosis of both kidneys. The term primary pelvic hydronephrosis is used when the obstruction, usually functional, is at the junction of the renal pelvis and ureter. Surgical relief by pyeloplasty is advisable to avoid the back pressure atrophy of the kidney and the complications of infection and stone formation. $\textemdash$hydronephrotic adj.
