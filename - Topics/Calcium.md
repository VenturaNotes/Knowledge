- $n$. a metallic element essential for the normal development and functioning of the body. Calcium is an important constituent of bones and teeth: the matrix of bone, consisting principally of calcium phosphate, accounts for about $99 \%$ of the body's calcium. It is present in the blood at a concentration of about $10 \mathrm{mg} / 100 \mathrm{ml}$, being maintained at this level by hormones (see CALCITONIN; PARATHYROID HORMONE). It is essential for many metabolic processes, including nerve function, muscle contraction, and blood clotting.
- The RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) for men is $700 \mathrm{mg} /$ day and women $800 \mathrm{mg} /$ day; the National Osteoporosis Society recommends up to $1200 \mathrm{mg} /$ day for individuals with osteoporosis. The best sources are dairy products (milk and cheese); the absorption from cereals and green vegetables is limited by the presence of phytates and oxalates. Its uptake by the body is facilitated by vitamin D; a deficiency of this vitamin may result in such conditions as rickets, osteoporosis, and osteomalacia. A deficiency of calcium in the blood may lead to tetany. Excess calcium may be deposited in the body as calculi (stones). Symbol: Ca.
