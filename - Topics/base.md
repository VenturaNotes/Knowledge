## Source [^1]
- The number of unique digits used to represent numbers.

## Source[^2]
- (1) Another name for the radix of a positional number system. Hence decimal numbers are base 10 numbers and binary numbers are base 2 numbers. See NUMBER SYSTEM.

### For representation of numbers
- The integer represented as 4703 in standard decimal notation is written in this way because$$4703=\left(4 \times 10^{3}\right)+\left(7 \times 10^{2}\right)+(0 \times 10)+3$$The same integer can be written in terms of powers of 8 as follows:$$4703=\left(1 \times 8^{4}\right)+\left(1 \times 8^{3}\right)+\left(1 \times 8^{2}\right)+(3 \times 8)+7$$The expression on the right-hand side is abbreviated to $11137_{8}$ and is the representation of this number to base 8 (or octal). In general, if $g$ is an integer greater than 1, any positive integer $a$ can be written uniquely as$$a=c_{n} g^{n}+c_{n-1} g^{n-1}+\ldots+c_{1} g+c_{0},$$where each $c_{i}$ is a non-negative integer less than $g$. This is the representation of $a$ to base $g$ and is abbreviated to $c_{n} c_{n-1} \ldots c_{1} c_{0_g}$. Real numbers, not just integers, can also be written to any base, by using figures after a 'decimal' point, just as familiar decimal representations of real numbers are written to base 10. See also BINARY REPRESENTATION, DECIMAL, HEXADECIMAL.
### Of a Triangle
- It may be convenient to consider one side of a triangle to be the base of the triangle. The vertex opposite the base may then be called the apex of the triangle, and the distance from the apex to the line of the base is the height of the triangle.
