- Any of various kinds of connection between cells. Tight junctions form a seal between adjacent cells, particularly in epithelia, to prevent the passage of materials between cells. A primarily structural bond between cells is provided by adherens junctions and desmosomes, whereas communication between adjacent cells is facilitated by gap junctions in animal cells and plasmodesmata in plant cells.
