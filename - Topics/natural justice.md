- The minimum standard of fairness to be applied by a court when resolving a dispute. The main rules of natural justice include: (1) the right to be heard - each party to the dispute should be given an opportunity to answer any allegations made by the other party; (2) the rule against bias - the person involved in settling the dispute should act impartially, in particular by disclosing any interest in the outcome of the dispute.
- The rules of natural justice apply equally in judicial as well as in administrative proceedings. Alleging a breach of natural justice is the method commonly used to challenge an administrative decision before the courts.
