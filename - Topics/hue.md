- $n$. The dimension of a color that is determined by the wavelength of the light in relation to the wavelengths reflected from objects or surfaces in other parts of the visual field and that gives rise to a qualitative sensation such as red or blue, the other major dimensions of color being saturation (1) and lightness. The Munsell hue scale contains five principal hues (red, yellow, green, blue, purple) and five intermediate hues (yellow-red, green-yellow, blue-green, purple-blue, red-purple). See also chroma, chromatic (1), chromaticity, Munsell color system, non-spectral color. \[From Old English hÄ«w beauty, cognate with Old Norse $h \bar{y}$ fine hair]
