- A record of transactions which do not involve income or expenditure, but change the form in which assets are held. Receipt of a loan, for example, is not income, but an exchange of cash now for a promise to repay, usually with interest, in the future. In a country's balance of payments, the capital account is a record of international exchanges of assets and liabilities. See also FINANCIAL ACCOUNT.
