- Acronym for A Classification of Residential Neighbourhoods. This directory classifies 62 different types of neighbourhoods in the UK, assuming that people living in a particular postcode will have similar behaviour patterns, disposable incomes, etc. ACORN also identifies five main types of household: Wealthy Achievers, Urban Prosperous, Comfortably Off, Moderate Means, and Hard Pressed. It is used by companies to provide target areas for selling particular products or services (e.g. swimming pools, double glazing, etc.) or alternatively to exclude areas (particularly finance- and insurance-related) from a sales drive. It is also used extensively for selecting representative samples for questionnaire surveys. See also GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION SYSTEM.
