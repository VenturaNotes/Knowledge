- A programming language designed for programming systems in which the response time of the computer to stimuli is time critical. For instance, if a computer is controlling an elevator, then the computer must be able to respond quickly to the movements of the cage. Ada, Modula, CORAL 66, and RTL-2 are real-time languages to various degrees.
