- (dB) $n$. one tenth of a bel: a unit for comparing levels of power (especially sound) on a logarithmic scale. A power source of intensity $P$ has a power level of $10 \log _{10} P / P_{0}$ decibels, where $P_{0}$ is the intensity of a reference source. The decibel is much more widely used than the bel. In humans, the threshold of hearing is 0 dB ; a whisper is approximately 30 dB , normal speech 60 dB , a shout 90 dB , and a jet aircraft 120 dB .
