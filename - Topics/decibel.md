- (dB) $n$. one tenth of a bel: a unit for comparing levels of power (especially sound) on a logarithmic scale. A power source of intensity $P$ has a power level of $10 \log _{10} P / P_{0}$ decibels, where $P_{0}$ is the intensity of a reference source. The decibel is much more widely used than the bel. In humans, the threshold of hearing is 0 dB ; a whisper is approximately 30 dB , normal speech 60 dB , a shout 90 dB , and a jet aircraft 120 dB.
## Source[^2]
- A unit used to compare two power levels, usually applied to sound or electrical signals. Although the decibel is one tenth of a bel, it is the decibel, not the bel, that is invariably used. Two power levels $P$ and $P_{0}$ differ by $n$ decibels when $n=10 \log _{10} P / P_{0}$. If $P$ is the level of sound intensity to be measured, $P_{0}$ is a reference level, usually the intensity of a note of the same frequency at the threshold of audibility.
- The logarithmic scale is convenient as human audibility has a range of 1 (just audible) to $10^{12}$ (just causing pain) and one decibel, representing an increase of some $26 \%$, is about the smallest change the ear can detect.
