## Source [^1]
- (dB) $n$. one tenth of a bel: a unit for comparing levels of power (especially sound) on a logarithmic scale. A power source of intensity $P$ has a power level of $10 \log _{10} P / P_{0}$ decibels, where $P_{0}$ is the intensity of a reference source. The decibel is much more widely used than the bel. In humans, the threshold of hearing is 0 dB ; a whisper is approximately 30 dB , normal speech 60 dB , a shout 90 dB , and a jet aircraft 120 dB.
## Source[^2]
- A unit used to compare two power levels, usually applied to sound or electrical signals. Although the decibel is one tenth of a bel, it is the decibel, not the bel, that is invariably used. Two power levels $P$ and $P_{0}$ differ by $n$ decibels when $n=10 \log _{10} P / P_{0}$. If $P$ is the level of sound intensity to be measured, $P_{0}$ is a reference level, usually the intensity of a note of the same frequency at the threshold of audibility.
- The logarithmic scale is convenient as human audibility has a range of 1 (just audible) to $10^{12}$ (just causing pain) and one decibel, representing an increase of some $26 \%$, is about the smallest change the ear can detect.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A unit equal to one-tenth of a bel for expressing the intensity of a sound or any other power level relative to a reference level. When it is used to specify absolute rather than relative sound intensity, the reference level is conventionally fixed at $10^{-16} \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ (watts per square centimetre), slightly below the average human absolute threshold for a sound of 1,000 hertz (about two octaves above Middle C), and the intensity so defined is referred to as decibel sound pressure level ( $d B S P L$ ) or simply sound pressure level (SPL). A sound of 60 dB SPL, the approximate level of ordinary conversational speech, is 60dB higher than the reference level and has an intensity of $10^{-10} \mathrm{~W} / \mathrm{cm}^{2}$, and a doubling or halving of absolute sound pressure level always corresponds to a change of 3 dB SPL. If two people speak at once, the sound level rises from 60 to 63 dB SPL, if four people speak at once it rises to approximately 66 dB SPL, and so on. In units of dB SPL, a sound that is loud enough to reach the pain threshold is about 130, a loud rock group reaches about 120, a person shouting at close range 100, a busy street 80, a loud conversation 70, a normal conversation 60, a quiet conversation 50, a soft whisper 30, and for a sound at 1,000 hertz the average human absolute threshold is 6.5 dB SPL. Exposure to sound above 85 dB SPL entails a risk of damage to the outer hair cells and permanent hearing loss. See also equal-loudness CONTOUR, PHON, SENSATION level. dB abbrev. \[From Latin deci(mus) tenth + English bel, named after the Scottish-born US scientist Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922), inventor of the telephone]
