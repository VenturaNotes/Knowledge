- The additional amount of one input required to keep output constant for a small decrease in the quantity of another input, per unit of the decrease. The marginal rate of technical substitution at a particular level of inputs is given by the negative of the gradient of the isoquant. This is the ratio of the marginal products for the two inputs. For a differentiable production function $F(K, L)$ the marginal rate of technical substitution between inputs $K$ and $L$ is$$M R T S_{K, L}=\frac{\partial F}{\partial K} / \frac{\partial F}{\partial L}$$
