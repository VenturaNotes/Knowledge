- An assessment of the work involved in a particular job, the responsibilities borne by the person who does it, and the skills, experience, or qualifications required, all with a view to evaluating the appropriate remuneration for the job and the differentials between it and other work in the same organization. Job evaluation enables different jobs to be compared with agreed common standards. These standards may be specific to an organization or an industry or they may be universal. Several procedures for job evaluation are in common use; see BENCHMARK JOB; CLASSIFICATION METHOD; FACTOR-COMPARISON METHOD; JOB-COMPONENT METHOD; POINT METHOD; RANKING METHOD.
