- $n$. inflammation of an alveolus or alveoli. Chronic inflammation of the walls of the alveoli of the lungs is usually caused by inhaled organic dusts (extrinsic allergic alveolitis; see BIRD-FANCIER'S LUNG; FARMER'S LUNG) but may occur spontaneously (cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis, CFA). CFA is now usually called idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis because the fibrosis seems to precede the alveolitis. It may be associated with connective tissue diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis or systemic sclerosis.
