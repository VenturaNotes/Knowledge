- A wide field of study that deals with the theory, applications, and computational methods for optimization problems. An abstract formulation of such problems is to maximize a function $f$ (known as an objective function) over a constraint set $S$, i.e.$$\operatorname{maximize} f(\mathbf{x}), \mathbf{x} \in S \subseteq R^{n}$$where $R^{n}$ denotes the space of real $n$-component vectors $\mathbf{x}$,$$\mathbf{x}=\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)^{\top}$$and $f$ is a real-valued function defined on $S$. If $S$ consists only of vectors whose elements are integers, then the problem is one of integer programming. Linear programming treats the case of $f$ as a linear function with $S$ defined by linear equations and/or constraints. Nonlinear objective functions with or without constraints (defined by systems of nonlinear equations) give rise to problems generally referred to as optimization problems.
- Mathematical-programming problems arise in engineering, business, and the physical and social sciences.
