- $n$. A culture-bound syndrome originally reported in Malaysia but later also in Indonesia, Laos, the Philippines, Papua New Guinea, Polynesia, Puerto Rico, and among the Navajo in North America, characterized by a period of hostile brooding, often precipitated by a perceived insult or affront, followed by an outburst of uncontrolled aggression directed at people and objects in the vicinity (running amok) with paranoid ideation and automatism, followed by exhaustion and amnesia for the violent behavior. It is often interpreted in Western cultures as a dissociative disorder. Also called amuck. See also Cafard, IICH'AA, MAL DE PELEA. \[From Malay amoq a furious assault]
