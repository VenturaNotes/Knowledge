- (1) the base of a hollow organ: the part farthest from the opening; e.g. the fundus of the stomach, bladder, or uterus. 
- (2) the interior concavity forming the back of the eyeball, opposite the pupil. Fundus flavimaculatus is a hereditary disease of the retina in which white material is deposited in the fundus at the level of the retinal pigment epithelium (see RETINA). It usually causes loss of central vision, but good vision may persist into adulthood. Fundus albipunctatus is a hereditary disease in which the fundus shows widespread distribution of uniform-sized white dots, resulting in poor dark adaptation.
