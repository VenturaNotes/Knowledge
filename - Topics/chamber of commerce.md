- In the UK, a voluntary organization, existing in most towns, of commercial, industrial, and trading business people who represent their joint interests to local and central government. The London Chamber of Commerce and Industry is the largest such organization in the UK. Most UK chambers of commerce are affiliated to British Chambers of Commerce, which represents their interests to government. Formerly, a distinction was recognized between chambers of commerce and chambers of trade, which represented local retailers and had a more limited range of interests. This distinction is now obsolete, with many organizations having the official title 'chamber of trade and commerce'.
