- A method of running a large organization in which, in addition to a board of management, there is a supervisory board. It is claimed that this practice, which is common in Continental Europe, provides an effective method of corporate governance. In the UK, the normal practice is for a single board to consist of both executive and non-executive directors.

- A system of company organization in which there are two boards of directors. Overall policy is decided by a supervisory board, on which employees as well as the shareholders are represented, and day-today management decisions are taken by a management board. The object of this division is to promote information and goodwill among employees by having their representatives on the supervisory body, while retaining the authority necessary for the managers to execute policies effectively through the management board. This system is relatively common in Germany.
