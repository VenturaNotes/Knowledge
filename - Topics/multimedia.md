- The combined use of digitized information representing text, sound, and still or video images, or the media so used. The term can refer to any interactive system and any data storage medium, but is widely applied to data stored on CD-ROM or DVD and accessed by a personal computer: the dialogue with the user makes use of the various media in an integrated way. The PC must be equipped with a CD-ROM drive; it usually also has a sound card and a pair of loudspeakers, since the audio capability of an ordinary PC is very limited. All but the cheapest modern PCs meet these requirements.

- Multimedia is technology to present interactive information. It consists of a combination of text, images, audio, video, animations, and data. Users can create and engage with this media on computers, phones, and kiosks. Communication, entertainment, education, gaming, and advertising technologies often use multimedia content.

- The integration of text, graphics, sound, and still or moving pictures in the storing and presentation of information by computers. Personal computers are now able to present information in a wide variety of forms from a wide variety of sources. Networked systems are able to transfer live TV pictures together with text and graphics. However, the ability of organizations to exploit this technology, e.g. for conferencing, may be restricted by the bandwidth of their systems.
