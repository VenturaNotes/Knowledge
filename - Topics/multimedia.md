- The combined use of digitized information representing text, sound, and still or video images, or the media so used. The term can refer to any interactive system and any data storage medium, but is widely applied to data stored on CD-ROM or DVD and accessed by a personal computer: the dialogue with the user makes use of the various media in an integrated way. The PC must be equipped with a CD-ROM drive; it usually also has a sound card and a pair of loudspeakers, since the audio capability of an ordinary PC is very limited. All but the cheapest modern PCs meet these requirements.
