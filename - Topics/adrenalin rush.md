- $n$. A sudden increase in competitive drive displayed by an athlete or sports competitor, supposedly associated with the release of adrenalin into the bloodstream. This expression is based on a misunderstanding of the effects of adrenalin and is avoided in careful usage: noradrenalin rush or even serotonin rush would be marginally more apt.
