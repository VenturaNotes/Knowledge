- Automated business process discovery (ABPD) is a business process model that offers cost and time savings over traditional business process discovery. ABPD uses process discovery—tools and techniques that analyze processes in an organization—to close knowledge gaps between departments and functions. It relies on unstructured, event-level data to build process models and definitions and explore variations in processes. That allows for deeper and more interactive analysis. ABPD discovers patterns in information obtained from processes that take place in an organization. As a result, ABPD gives a clearer picture of specific businesses processes and how changes to these processes can impact workflows.
