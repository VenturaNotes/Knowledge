- A sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, e.g.
	- $0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8$
- The Fibonacci numbers $F_n$ are formally defined to be
	- $F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1$
	- $F_{n+2} = F_{n+1} + F_n, n \ge 0$
- Any positive number $m$ can be represented uniquely as a sum of Fibonacci numbers, where the greatest $F_n$ in the expansion does not exceed $m$ and where no two of the $F_n$ are adjacent numbers in the Fibonacci series
