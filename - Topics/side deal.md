- A private deal between two people, usually for the personal benefit of one of them, as a subsidiary to a transaction between the officials of a company, government, etc. For example, the chairman of a public company may agree to encourage the board to welcome a takeover bid, provided that a personal profit can be made in some side deal with the bidder. Side deals are rigorously investigated by the Panel on Takeovers and Mergers (see City Code on Takeovers and Mergers).
