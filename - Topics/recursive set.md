- A subset $A$ of a set $B$ is said to be recursive, relative to $B$, if there is an algorithm or effective procedure that, given an element $b$ in $B$, will output 'yes' if $b$ is an element of $A$ and 'no' if $b$ is not an element of $A$. The set $A$ is thus also said to be decidable or computable.

- Strictly speaking the sets $A$ and $B$ should be sets of natural numbers, and the algorithm is a definition of the total recursive function that is the characteristic function of $A$ in $B$. The concept and terminology is transferred to other data sets using a GÃ¶del numbering.
- Post's theorem says that a set $A$ is recursive iff $A$ and $B-A$ are recursively enumerable.
