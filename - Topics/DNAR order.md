- Do Not Attempt Resuscitation order: an instruction, usually made by a patient while he or she has capacity and recorded in their notes, requesting that doctors desist from performing resuscitation in the event of physiological failure. By respecting a patient's choice with regard to resuscitation, a doctor is respecting that patient's autonomy. If resuscitation is considered futile, a decision not to attempt it may be taken; ideally, this should be communicated to the patient and the reasons explained sensitively.
