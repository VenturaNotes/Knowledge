- $n$. a disease, common in the tropics and subtropics, caused by parasitic protozoans of the genus Leishmania, which are transmitted by the bite of sandflies. There are two principal forms of the disease: visceral leishmaniasis, in which the cells of various internal organs are affected (see KALA-AZAR); and cutaneous leishmaniasis, which affects the tissues of the skin. Cutaneous leishmaniasis itself has several different forms, depending on the region in which it occurs and the species of Leishmania involved. In Asia it is common in the form of oriental sore. In America there are several forms of leishmaniasis (see CHICLERO'S ULCER; ESPUNDIA). Leishmaniasis is treated with drugs containing antimony.
