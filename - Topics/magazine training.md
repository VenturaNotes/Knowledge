- $n$. In experimental research with an animal in a Skinner box, a preparatory process during which food is delivered without the animal having to press a lever, peck a key, or make any other response. Its purpose is to accustom the animal to the sound and sight of the food being delivered from the magazine to the food hopper so that this does not cause disturbance during the subsequent learning process.
