## Source [^1]
- $n$. an organ or group of cells that is specialized for synthesizing and secreting certain fluids, either for use in the body or for excretion. There are two main groups of glands: the exocrine glands, which discharge their secretions by means of ducts, and the endocrine glands, which secrete their products $\textendash$ hormones $\textendash$ directly into the bloodstream. See also SECRETION.

- A group of cells or a single cell in animals or plants that is specialized to secrete a specific substance. In animals there are two types of glands, both of which synthesize their secretions. Endocrine glands discharge their products directly into the blood vessels; exocrine glands secrete through a duct or network of ducts into a body cavity or onto the body surface. Secretory cells are characterized by having droplets (vesicles) containing their products. See also RECTAL GLAND; SECRETION.
- In plants glands are specialized to secrete certain substances produced by the plant. The secretions may be retained within a single cell, secreted into a special cavity or duct, or secreted to the outside. Examples are the water glands (hydathodes) of certain leaves, nectaries (see NECTAR), and the digestive glands of certain carnivorous plants. See also SALT GLAND (sense 2).
