- $n$. the process by which licensed doctors are required to demonstrate to the General Medical Council on a regular basis that they are up to date and fit to practise medicine. Revalidation aims to give extra confidence to patients that their doctor is being regularly checked by their employer and the GMC. Revalidation started in the UK in December 2012. Licensed doctors usually have to revalidate every five years, by having regular annual appraisals based on the GMC's core guidance for doctors. Only doctors who have a licence to practise are required to revalidate. See LICENSING. See also CLINICAL GOVERNANCE.
