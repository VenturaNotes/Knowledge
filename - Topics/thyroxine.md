- (tetraiodothyronine, $\mathrm{T}_{4}$ ) $n$. the principal hormone synthesized and secreted into the bloodstream by the thyroid gland (see THYROID HORMONE). Most of it is converted to a more metabolically active form, triiodothyronine, within the peripheral tissues. Both hormones act to increase the basal metabolic rate. A preparation of thyroxine (levothyroxine sodium) can be administered by mouth to treat underactivity of the thyroid gland.
