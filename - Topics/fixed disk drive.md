The individual disks in the stack are called platters. Both sides are coated and the platters are mounted on a common spindle. Early fixed disk drives used disks with a diameter of 36 inches. The size, in inches, has progressively decreased in the sequence $14,10.5,9,8,5.25,3.5,2.5,1.8,1.3$. Not all manufacturers used all of these sizes but currently 3.5 inch disk drives are used throughout the industry, with capacities of many gigabytes. Portable PCs currently use 2.5 inch disk drives.
