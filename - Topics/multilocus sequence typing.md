- (MLST) A procedure for characterizing isolates of bacteria or other microbial organisms based on sequencing the DNA of certain internal fragments of seven specific housekeeping genes that are common to all species. The alleles at each of the seven loci define each isolate unambiguously, enabling the sample profile to be identified by comparing it with a large database of MLST profiles.
