- $n$. the active unit of excretion in the kidney (see illustration). Blood, which is supplied by branches of the renal artery, is filtered through a knot of capillaries (glomerulus) into the cup-shaped Bowman's capsule so that water, nitrogenous waste, and many other substances (excluding colloids) pass into the renal tubule. Here most of the substances are reabsorbed back into the blood, the remaining fluid ( ${ }^{}$ urine) passing into the collecting duct, which drains into the ureter.
