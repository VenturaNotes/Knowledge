- $n$. In statistics, a distribution-free nonparametric test of the difference between two independent groups in the extremity of scores (in both directions) that the groups contain. Scores from both groups are pooled and converted to ranks, and the test statistic is the span of scores (the range plus 1) in one of the groups chosen arbitrarily. An exact probability is computed for the span and then recomputed after dropping a specified number of extreme scores from each end of its range. \[Named after the US statistician Lincoln Ellsworth Moses (1921-2006) who introduced it in 1952]
