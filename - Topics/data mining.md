- Extraction of useful information from large data sets. Data mining is not the same as data analysis: data analysis is focused on estimation and assessment of an existing model, while data mining attempts to extract implicit information by using 'automated' software techniques for finding patterns and regularities, as well as detecting anomalies, in sets of data. This is sometimes referred to as 'knowledge discovery'. See also AUTOMATED ECONOMETRICS.
## Source[^2]
- The nontrivial explication or extraction of information from data, in which the information is implicit and previously unknown; an example is identification of the pattern of use of a credit card to detect possible fraud. The data is normally accessed from one or more databases, so the technique is also known as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). It involves a number of different methods from artificial intelligence such as neural networks and machine induction, together with statistical methods such as cluster analysis and data summarization.

- Data mining describes the act of looking at data for valuable patterns or trends. Businesses gather all kinds of data in their day-to-day operations. Through data mining, they can begin to identify strengths, weaknesses, and goals for the future based on things like sales trends and website traffic. When done often and correctly, data mining helps turn data into real-world decisions that can improve a business overall.
## Source[^4]
- The process of extracting useful knowledge from the huge volumes of data kept in modern computer databases. Sophisticated algorithms and statistical techniques are used to identify significant trends or patterns within complex data and to form predictive models. Major business applications include the mining of electronic point of sale data to build customer profiles and identify regional or seasonal buying patterns. In finance, data mining is used to formulate the algorithms used in automated high-frequency trading.
## Source[^5]
- $n$. A collective name for analytic techniques designed to discover hidden patterns or relationships in large data sets and to overcome the difficulties involved in drawing meaningful inferences from vast quantities of information. The term is occasionally, but misleadingly, used as a synonym for data snooping. Compare Exploratory data analysis. \[Named by analogy with digging for tiny amounts of metal in large volumes of earth]
