- Extraction of useful information from large data sets. Data mining is not the same as data analysis: data analysis is focused on estimation and assessment of an existing model, while data mining attempts to extract implicit information by using 'automated' software techniques for finding patterns and regularities, as well as detecting anomalies, in sets of data. This is sometimes referred to as 'knowledge discovery'. See also AUTOMATED ECONOMETRICS.
## Source[^2]
- The nontrivial explication or extraction of information from data, in which the information is implicit and previously unknown; an example is identification of the pattern of use of a credit card to detect possible fraud. The data is normally accessed from one or more databases, so the technique is also known as knowledge discovery in databases (KDD). It involves a number of different methods from artificial intelligence such as neural networks and machine induction, together with statistical methods such as cluster analysis and data summarization.
