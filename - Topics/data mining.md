- Extraction of useful information from large data sets. Data mining is not the same as data analysis: data analysis is focused on estimation and assessment of an existing model, while data mining attempts to extract implicit information by using 'automated' software techniques for finding patterns and regularities, as well as detecting anomalies, in sets of data. This is sometimes referred to as 'knowledge discovery'. See also AUTOMATED ECONOMETRICS.
