## Source [^1]
- Any system whose primary purpose is to provide a framework within which other systems can be tested. Test beds are usually tailored to a specific programming language and implementation technique, and often to a specific application. Typically a test bed provides some means of simulating the environment of the system under test, of test-data generation and presentation, and of recording test results.
