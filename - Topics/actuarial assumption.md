- An estimate of a random variable that is used in a financial calculation to determine a premium or a benefit. For example, the premium charged for a life insurance policy requires an estimate of a personâ€™s remaining lifespan given their individual characteristics (such as age, gender, health, and occupation). The estimate is calculated by an actuary, using past data.
