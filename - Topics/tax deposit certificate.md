- A certificate issued by HM Revenue and Customs to a taxpayer who has made an advance payment in anticipation of future income tax, capital-gains tax, or inheritance tax. The initial payment must not be less than $£ 500$ and should be made to HMRC; deposits of over $£ 100,000$ held for one month bear interest which is liable to tax. The certificate may be withdrawn for cash or surrendered to meet a tax demand. A higher rate is paid on the latter. Interest normally runs to the date of encashment but if the certificate is used to pay tax, it runs only to the due date of payment of the liability, not the actual date of payment.
