- The study of the fluctuations that occur in the numbers of individuals in animal and plant populations and the factors controlling these fluctuations. Changes in numbers depend on rates of births, deaths, emigration, and immigration (see POPULATION GROWTH). An important distinction is between controlling factors that are dependent on population density and have a stabilizing effect (e.g. food supply) and those that are independent of population density (e.g. catastrophes, such as flooding). Fluctuations of certain predators may follow those of their prey in fairly regular population cycles.
