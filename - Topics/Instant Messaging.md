- Instant messaging (IM) is a chat technology for sending real-time text messages online. When someone sends an IM with a computer or mobile device, the recipient is alerted. A pop-up screen shows the brief message, which prompts the recipient to respond right back. This push-style communication can include features like emojis, file transfers, and video chats. An instant messenger can be a standalone mobile app, computer software, or part of social media. Compared to a public chatroom, IM occurs between two people who know each other or are part of a contact list.
