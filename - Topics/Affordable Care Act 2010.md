- (ACA) US federal legislation that introduced the most sweeping reforms to the US health-care system since the launch of Medicaid and Medicare in 1965. Under the Act private insurers are placed under an obligation to accept all applicants; to charge the same premiums to all applicants of the same age, regardless of pre-existing conditions; and to provide certain 'essential health benefits' under every policy. A further provision, mandating all adults not otherwise covered to take out a private policy, was repealed in 2019. The Act also expanded eligibility to Medicaid, took steps to constrain the costs of Medicare, and encouraged more employers to provide schemes to their employees; there were also reforms to health-care delivery. Known in full as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), the legislation is often referred to colloquially as Obamacare, after President Barack Obama, who introduced it.
