- A campaign management system (CMS) is software that businesses use to plan and execute marketing campaigns. It allows users to create and manage ads, track results, and analyze data to optimize future campaigns. A CMS can segment data to target specific customers and provide reporting for multiple channels such as email marketing, search engines (SEM), and display advertising networks (e.g., Google AdWords, Facebook Ads Manager).
