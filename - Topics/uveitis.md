- $n$. inflammation of any part of the uveal tract of the eye, either the iris (iritis), ciliary body (cyclitis), or choroid (choroiditis). Inflammation confined to the iris and ciliary body, which are commonly inflamed together, is called anterior uveitis or iridocyclitis (see also Fuchs' HETEROCHROMIC CYCLITIS); that confined to the choroid is termed posterior uveitis. In general, the causes of anterior and posterior uveitis are different; anterior uveitis (unlike choroiditis) is usually painful, with clusters of inflammatory cells (keratic precipitates) adhering to the inner surface of the cornea. All types may lead to visual impairment, and uveitis is an important cause of blindness. In most cases the disease appears to originate in the uveal tract itself, but it may occur secondarily to disease of other parts of the eye, particularly of the cornea and sclera.
- Treatment consists of the use of drugs that suppress the inflammation, combined with measures to relieve the discomfort and more specific drug treatment if a specific cause of the uveitis is found. The drugs may be given as drops, injections, or tablets, often in combination.
