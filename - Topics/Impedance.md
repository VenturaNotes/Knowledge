- Impedance describes the combined effect of resistance and reactance in an electrical circuit. Resistance is the hindrance of an electrical current by a resistor (an electrical component that regulates the flow of an electrical current). Reactance is the hindrance of a change within an electrical current by an inductor (an electrical component that stores energy in the form of a magnetic field) or capacitor (an electrical component that stores electrical energy in an electric field).
- Without impedance, the capacitors that control and regulate the electrical flow that power electronic devices or building electrical systems would not be able to function properly, resulting in fried electrical circuits.
