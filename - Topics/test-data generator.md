## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Any means for the automatic or semiautomatic production of data for use in the testing of some system. Typically both valid and invalid input data for the system under test will be generated in order to test responses to both valid and erroneous inputs. Some generators effectively produce a pseudorandom data stream, recognizing only constraints on the formats of the data. More advanced generators might attempt to produce data that will give good test coverage.
