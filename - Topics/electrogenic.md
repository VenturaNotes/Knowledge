- Describing an ion transport protein or other cell mechanism that generates an electrochemical potential across a cell membrane, by creating a net redistribution of charged ions. For example, each cycle of the sodium/potassium ATPase sodium pump causes three sodium ions to leave the cell and two potassium ions to enter the cell, hence creating a net negative charge inside the cell. See RESTING POTENTIAL.
