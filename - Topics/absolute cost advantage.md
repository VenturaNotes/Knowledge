- The cost advantage enjoyed by a country in producing certain goods, compared to costs in other countries. The costs of producing similar products vary between different countries because certain resources, such as labour, raw materials, and energy, will be cheaper in some countries than in others. Multinational enterprises are able to take advantage of these cost differences by buying components or products from countries that have these advantages. Compare COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE.
