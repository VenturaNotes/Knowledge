- A collection of objects $A$, together with a related set of morphisms M. An object is a generalization of a set and a morphism is a generalization of a function that maps between sets.

  

The set M is the disjoint union of sets of the form $[A, B]$, where $A$ and $B$ are elements of $\boldsymbol{A}$; if $\alpha$ is a member of $[A, B], A$ is the domain of $\alpha, B$ is the codomain of $\alpha$, and $\alpha$ is said to be a morphism from $A$ to $B$. For each triple $(A, B, C)$ of elements of $\boldsymbol{A}$ there is a dyadic operation ${ }^{\circ}$ from the Cartesian product

  

$$

[B, C] \times[A, B]

$$

  

to $[A, C]$. The image $\beta^{\circ} \alpha$ of the ordered pair $(\beta, \alpha)$ is the composition of $\beta$ with $\alpha$; the composition operation is associative. In addition, when the composition is defined there is an identity morphism for each $A$ in A.

  

Examples of categories include the set of groups and homomorphisms on groups, and the set of rings and homomorphisms on rings. See FUNCTION.
