- $n$. a benign tumor composed of blood vessels or lymph vessels. Cherry angiomas (or Campbell de Morgan spots) are small red spots on the trunk in middle-aged or elderly people. They are completely harmless and consist of a minor vascular malformation. An arteriovenous angioma (or malformation) is a knot of distended blood vessels overlying and compressing the surface of the brain. It may cause epilepsy, or one of the vessels may burst, causing a subarachnoid haemorrhage or a haemorrhage within the brain (intracerebral haemorrhage). This type of angioma may be suitable for surgical removal or stereotactic radiotherapy (see STEREOTACTIC LOCALIZATION). It may be associated with a purple birthmark on the face: this is called the Sturge-Weber syndrome. Arteriovenous malformations may occur in many other parts of the body, where they are often asymptomatic. See also HAEMANGIOMA; LYMPHANGIOMA.
