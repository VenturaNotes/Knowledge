- ZigBee is a wireless device that helps set up a low-rate wireless personal area network. It operates under the IEEE 802.15.4 protocols. The devices are meant to be used over a very small radius, usually no more than 100 meters, and devices using it must remain within line of sight. These devices do not consume extensive amounts of power. This makes the device ideal for setting up home or work networks.
