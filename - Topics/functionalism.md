- $n$. Any doctrine that emphasizes utility or purpose, especially the school of psychology that was launched in 1896 by the US pragmatist philosopher and psychologist John Dewey (1859-1952) and that flourished for many years at the University of Chicago under the influence of Dewey, George Herbert Mead (1863-1931), and James Rowland Angell (1869-1949), at Columbia University under the influence of Edward Thorndike (1874-1949) and Robert S(essions) Woodworth (1869-1962), and at Harvard University under the influence of William James (1842-1910). Instead of analysing the structure of mental experience, as was conventional in structuralism (2), functionalism examined both mental experience and behaviour from the standpoint of their functional value in adapting the organism to its environment, in a deliberate attempt to introduce evolutionary ideas into psychology. Conscious experiences were interpreted as phenomena that arise when automatic, reflex behavior is inadequate to meet the needs of an organism, as when a person who is learning to ride a bicycle eventually ceases to be conscious of every movement when conscious awareness is no longer needed. The early practitioners of functionalism were the first to use non-human animals in psychological experiments. During the 1920s and 1930s, functionalism was gradually swallowed up by behaviorism. \[From Latin functio a performance, from fungi to perform + Greek -ismos indicating a state or condition]
