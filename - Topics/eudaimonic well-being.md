- $n$. An ancient concept imported into modern psychology in an article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 1989 by the US psychologist Carol D. Ryff (born 1950) and incorporated into positive psychology after 2000. According to Ryff, it is a type of well-being with the following six dimensions: self-acceptance, positive relations with others, autonomy, environmental mastery, purpose in life, and personal growth. Its chief significance is that it goes beyond shortterm hedonic well-being; it reflects how one feels about life when thinking about it, rather than how one feels about life when living it. Also spelt eudemonic or eudaemonic well-being. \[From Greek eudaimonia defined by Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics (1095a, 15-22) as 'doing and living well', from eu- well + daimon inner or guardian spirit pleasure + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
