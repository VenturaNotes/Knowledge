## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A matrix is in [[row echelon form]] (ref) when it satisfies the following conditions
	- (1) The first non-zero element in each row, called the [[leading entry]], is 1

## Source[^2]
- The use of square bracket notation and parentheses notation for matrices is interchangeable
$$\begin{pmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{pmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} a & b \\ c & d \end{bmatrix} $$
## Source[^3]
- The number of elements of a matrix is always finite
	- This is true because a matrix by definition has a specific number of rows and columns, meaning there is a [[countable]], finite number of elements within it[^5]
		- #question What is meant by countable?
- The number of elements of a matrix of order $mxn$ is $mn$ 
- The position of an element of a matrix is (row number, column number)

## Source[^4]
- The position of an element in a matrix is typically referred to using its index or indices
- For example, in matrix A, the element in the $i^{th}$ row and $j^{th}$ column is denoted as $A_{ij}$, and this is referred to as the element at position $(i, j)$ 
- #question I need to create a separate note for "index" of a matrix
