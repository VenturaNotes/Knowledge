- $n$. the destruction of diseased or unwanted tissue based on freezing. For example, prostate cryotherapy involves two alternate freeze-thaw cycles using specialized needles introduced into the prostate through the perineum to destroy cancer cells, either after failed radiotherapy or as a primary treatment. Freezing is performed by the infusion of argon gas through the needles and thawing by the infusion of helium. See also CYCLOCRYOTHERAPY; CRYOSURGERY; HYPOTHERMIA.
