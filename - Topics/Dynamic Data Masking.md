- Dynamic data masking (DDM) is a new technology that prevents unauthorized access to an organization's sensitive production data. DDM masks production data in a data stream so only authorized persons can view that data; however, it doesn't change the original production data. Users of this security technique configure data on designated database fields so unauthorized persons can't view sensitive data in query results.
