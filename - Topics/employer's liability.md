- The legal liability of employers to compensate their employees for accidents and illnesses due to their work. Employers in the UK are compelled to insure themselves for this. It would be possible to run an economy on the basis that wages reflected the risks to health of various jobs, and employees were responsible for insuring themselves. There are two main arguments for imposing the liability on employers. One is economies of scale: there are far fewer employers than workers in the economy, so insurance by employers is less costly both to carry out and to enforce. The other argument is economy of information: on average employers have a broader experience of occupational risks in their industry, and they are responsible for working practices. They can use their experience to organize work in ways which keep down the risks run, and thus the cost of insurance.
