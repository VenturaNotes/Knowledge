- pack years a measure of a person's cumulative cigarette consumption over a long period of time. It is expressed as the number of packs (assuming 20 cigarettes in a pack) smoked per day multiplied by the number of years of smoking:$$\text{number of pack years} =( \text{packs} [\text{or cigarettes}/20]\text{smoked per day} ) \times( \text{years smoking} ).$$
- For example, a patient who has smoked 15 cigarettes a day for 40 years has a $(15 / 20) \times 40=30$ pack-year smoking history.
