- Deception technology is a collection of tools and strategies used to divert cybercriminals away from a company’s true assets. In this cybersecurity tactic, the cybercriminal is tricked into believing that they have gained access to important company data, when in reality they have accessed a strategically placed decoy or trap.
- When cyberattackers interact with deceptive assets, a business’ security team is then able to gain intelligence regarding how the cyberattacker functions. This insight allows cybersecurity teams to shut down the attack and learn how to better defend their company’s assets. This strategy is often used to minimize the damage caused by cyberattacks and protect sensitive business information.
