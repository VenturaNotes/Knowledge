- (FSA) An independent, nongovernmental body set up in 1997 to regulate the financial services industry in the UK. It was given statutory powers by the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000, which specified four statutory objectives for the FSA: to maintain market confidence; to promote public understanding of the financial system; to ensure a satisfactory degree of consumer protection; and to reduce the possibilities for financial crime. In 2013 the FSA was abolished and its responsibilities divided between two new bodies, the Financial Conduct Authority and the Prudential Regulation Authority.
