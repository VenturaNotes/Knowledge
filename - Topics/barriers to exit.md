- Obstacles that make it costly for a firm to exit a market. Barriers to exit intensify competition in a market because incumbent firms have little choice but to 'stay and fight'. Examples of barriers to exit include the costs involved with the write-off of assets, redundancy payments, penalties for terminating contracts, and the loss of reputation and goodwill.

- Factors that make it difficult for a company to leave a market that is no longer profitable or that has ceased to provide an acceptable return on capital. For example, the workforce producing the product may not be redeployable, the plant and machinery producing it may be unsaleable, the product may have a niche in the company's product range that would affect sales of the whole range if it was withdrawn, etc.
