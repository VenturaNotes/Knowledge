- A function$$f: X \rightarrow X$$from which is defined the iteration $$x,f(x),f(f(x)),f(f(f(x))),...$$for any element $x$ in set $X$. Thus a new function$$F: X \times N \rightarrow X$$is created by$$F(x, t)=f^{t}(x)$$where $N$ is the set of natural numbers. The construct that makes $F$ from $f$ is, under certain circumstances, equivalent with the construct of primitive recursion. Iterated maps are used to model the dynamical behavior of computers (for example, by iterating a next state function) and physical systems (for example, a neurone firing), and to generate fractals.
