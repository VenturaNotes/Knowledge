- the flexible plate of fibrocartilage that connects any two adjacent vertebrae in the backbone. At birth the central part of the disc $\textendash$ the nucleus pulposus $\textendash$ consists of a gelatinous substance, which gradually becomes replaced by cartilage with age. The intervertebral discs account for one quarter of the total length of the backbone; they act as shock absorbers, protecting the brain and spinal cord from the impact produced by running and other movements. A tear in the outer fibrous portion of the disc results in displacement of the nucleus pulposus to varying degrees: protrusion, prolapse (see PROLAPSED INTERVERTEBRAL DISC), extrusion, or sequestration.
## Source[^2]
- Any of the discs of cartilage that separate the bones of the vertebral column. The intervertebral discs allow the vertebral column a certain degree of flexibility and they also absorb shock.
