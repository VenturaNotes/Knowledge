## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- In the [[Implication|conditional statement]] "If P, then Q"
	- P is the antecedent or hypothesis
	- Q is the consequent or conclusion

## Source[^2]
- The antecedent is not a [[premise]]
## Source[^3]
- Given the conditional statement $p \to q$, p is called the hypothesis (or antecedent, or premise)
	- A source contradicts this statement saying that an antecedent is not a premise [^2]

## Source[^4]
- The clause in a conditional statement which expresses the condition. So in 'if $n$ is divisible by 2, $n$ is even', the antecedent is 'n is divisible by 2'. Compare CONSEQUENT
