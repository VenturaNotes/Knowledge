## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- In the [[Implication|conditional statement]] "If P, then Q"
	- P is the antecedent or hypothesis
	- Q is the consequent or conclusion

## Source[^2]
- The antecedent is not a [[premise]]
## Source[^3]
- Given the conditional statement $p \to q$, p is called the hypothesis (or antecedent, or premise)
	- A source contradicts this statement saying that an antecedent is not a premise [^2]



“The conditional statement p → q is the proposition “if p, then q.” The conditional statement p → q is false when p is true and q is false, and true otherwise. In the conditional statement p → q, p is called the hypothesis (or [[antecedent]] or premise) and q is called the [[conclusion]] (or consequence).” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=29&annotation=98V8KB4P))
