- A meromorphic doubly-periodic function defined on the complex plane such that $f(z+ma+nb) = f(z)$ for all integers $m, n,$ where $a/b$ is not real. Note that such an elliptic function defines a meromorphic function on the elliptic curve $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ denotes the lattice $a \mathbb{Z} + b\mathbb{Z}$.
- Note further by Liouville's theorem that holomorphic elliptic functions are constant. Elliptic functions became of interest as a consequence of elliptic integrals.
