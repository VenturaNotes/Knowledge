- (GNP) The gross domestic product (GDP) with the addition of interest, profits, and dividends received from abroad by UK residents and with those payments made from the UK to overseas residents deducted. The GNP better reflects the welfare of the population in monetary terms, although it is not as accurate a guide as to the productive performance of the economy as the GDP. See also NET NATIONAL PRODUCT.
