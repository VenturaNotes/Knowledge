- (GNP) The gross domestic product (GDP) with the addition of interest, profits, and dividends received from abroad by UK residents and with those payments made from the UK to overseas residents deducted. The GNP better reflects the welfare of the population in monetary terms, although it is not as accurate a guide as to the productive performance of the economy as the GDP. See also NET NATIONAL PRODUCT.
## Source[^2]
- (GNP) One of the main measures of national economic activity. The GNP of a country is defined as the total market value of all final goods and services produced by the residents of this country in a given period of time (usually a calendar year). 'Gross' indicates that it is measured without subtracting any allowance for capital consumption; 'national' that it includes residents' incomes from economic activities carried out abroad as well as at home, and excludes incomes produced at home but belonging to non-residents. 'Product' indicates that it measures real output produced rather than real output absorbed by residents. GNP is reported at both current and constant prices.
