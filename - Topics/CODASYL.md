- A now-defunct organization dedicated mainly to the development of the data processing language Cobol and associated software. It originated at a meeting, the Conference on Data Systems Languages, called in the Pentagon by the US Department of Defense in 1959 to consider both the desirability and feasibility of establishing a common language for data processing. The acronym for that conference, CODASYL, became the name of the continuing organization. The initial version of the language, COBOL-60, was published the following year, with subsequent versions being adopted by ISO.
- During 1965-67 CODASYL established a Database Task Group (DBTG) to investigate and develop proposals for a common database management system to be used in association with Cobol as the host language (see DATABASE LANGUAGE). In 1969 a report giving a specification was published and widely discussed. A revised report published in 1971 allowed also for other languages to be used as the host programming language. IDMS is the leading product based on these proposals.
- CODASYL itself no longer exists, although some of its committees continue to operate. See CODASYL NETWORK MODEL.
