- (letter of identification) A letter issued by a bank to a customer to whom a letter of credit has been supplied. The letter has to be produced with the letter of credit at the negotiating bank; it provides evidence of the bearer's identity and a specimen of his or her signature. It is used particularly with a circular letter of credit carried by travelers, although traveller's cheques are now more widely used.
