- The first electron acceptor in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. It accepts an electron from the excited form of photosystem II (see PHOTOSYSTEMS I AND II), and passes it on via another acceptor, $\mathrm{Q}_{\mathrm{A}}$, to plastoquinone. Pheophytin is a form of chlorophyll $a$ in which the magnesium ion is replaced by two hydrogen ions. It participates in the crucial step of converting light energy to chemical energy.
