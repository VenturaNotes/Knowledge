- A complex system has many constituent parts which interact with one another in various, usually complicated ways. Thus, modelling complex systems is problematic and usually involves some simplifications.
- The Earth's climate is an important example. Biological systems, whether in the case of a single cell or an individual organism or species' interactions, are complex systems. Many aspects of human existence and society-use of the Internet, spread of disease, population movements, economies-are all complex systems.
- Complex systems are commonly represented as networks with vertices representing the parts and edges representing interactions. As the number of individual elements may be too great to treat each as a part, homogeneous subsets may be compartmentalized together; for example, an entire city may be treated as a single component.
