- adj. describing the condition of one who firmly believes that he or she belongs to the gender opposite to his or her biological sex. A transgender person will often seek gender reassignment, i.e. to be legally recognized as belonging to the gender opposite to that on his or her birth certificate. The transition may involve hormone treatment and/or surgery but there is no requirement for this. Under current UK law, the person must supply evidence that he or she has been medically diagnosed with gender dysphoria, has lived in his or her acquired gender for the past two years, and intends to remain in it until death. A proposed reform to the law would replace this process with one of simple self-declaration (although this idea has aroused some opposition). 'Transgender' is now preferred to the older term transsexual, as this refers more narrowly to those who have undergone surgery to change gender. See also GENDER DYSPHORIA.
