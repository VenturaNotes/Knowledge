- $n$. abnormal posterior and sideways curvature of the spine, i.e. kyphosis combined with scoliosis. The deformity may occur during growth for no apparent reason (idiopathic kyphoscoliosis) or may result from any of several diseases involving the vertebrae and spinal muscles. Special braces can reduce the extent of the deformity if this is mild. Severe deformity may require surgical correction by fusion of the spine.
