## Source [^1]
- A specialized device for storing data on a network. It fulfills a similar role as a file server, but more efficiently because it is dedicated to and optimized solely for storing data efficiently and securely. A NAS device consists of a disk-storage subsystem controlled by a NAS head, which interfaces with the network. Compare SAN.
## Source[^2]
- Network-attached storage refers to a storage device that is accessed through and connected to a network. It is often compared to cloud storage, because they both provide access to data remotely, but they are different. One of the biggest differences between the two is that with cloud storage, another party is responsible for the security of your data, while you are responsible for your data with a NAS.
