- $n$. a variety of white blood cell distinguished by a lobed nucleus and the presence in its cytoplasm of coarse granules that stain orange-red with Romanowsky stains. Eosinophils are capable of ingesting foreign particles, is present in large numbers in lining or covering surfaces within the body, is involved in allergic responses, and may be involved in host defence against parasites. There are normally $40-400 \times 10^{6}$ eosinophils per litre of blood. See also POLYMORPH.
## Source[^2]
- A type of white blood cell (leucocyte) that has a granular cytoplasm (see GRANULOCYTE) and is found chiefly in tissues, with only small numbers in the circulation. Eosinophils attack antibody-coated parasites by releasing from their granules powerful enzymes and free radicals. When activated they also release mediators such as prostaglandins, cytokines, and leukotrienes, which amplify the inflammatory response. Defective regulation of eosinophil activation, as in certain allergies and hypereosinophilia, can cause serious damage to body tissues.
