- The compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is the average rate of growth of revenue, sales, or investments over time. CAGR takes the effects of compounding interest and exponential growth rates into account.
- The CAGR equation is CAGR = $\frac{EV}{SV}^\frac 1n-1$ where:
	- EV is the end value SV is the start value n is the number of years or periods
- Here's an example. Suppose that a company's net revenue starts at a value of $100,000/year and ends at a value of $225,000 over a period of two years. Using the above equation, the CAGR of the company's revenue is (225000/100000)^(1/2) - 1 = (2.25)^(1/2) - 1 = 1.5 - 1 = 0.5 (or 50%). If we assume that revenue grew at the same rate each year, it grew from $100,000 to $150,000 in the first year and $150,000 to $225,000 in the second year, both times by 50%.
