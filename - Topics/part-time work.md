- Working for fewer than the number of hours per week normal for full-time workers in the country and occupation concerned. This may suit the preferences of employers or employees. Employers may prefer part-time to full-time work because it fits the time pattern of their need for labour, or offers more flexibility. Employers may also prefer part-time workers if they enjoy less stringent legal protection than full-time workers, or tax and social security contributions for them are lower. Workers may prefer part-time work because this is convenient given other claims on their time: for example, parents with young children, part-time students, or voluntary workers.
