- A system in which two (or more) machines are connected by a high-speed link in order to perform the total workload. Typically a small machine, the master, deals with file editing, job submission, and all scheduling. Larger jobs that would take too long to process on this small machine are passed to a larger machine, the slave, for processing, the results being returned to the user via the small machine.
