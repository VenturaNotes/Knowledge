- A device used to remove and collect small animals, such as insects, from a sample of soil or leaf litter. The sample is placed on a coarse sieve fixed across the wide end of a funnel and a 100-watt light bulb, in a metal reflector, is placed about 25 cm above the funnel. The heat from the bulb dries and warms the sample, causing the animals to move downwards and fall through the sieve into the funnel, which directs them into a collecting dish or tube below. The dish can contain water or alcohol to prevent the animals from escaping.
