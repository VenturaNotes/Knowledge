- Transmission of information as sequential units. For example, if two computers connected by a single wire wish to communicate an 8-bit unit of information, the sending computer would transmit each of the eight bits in sequence over the wire, while the receiving computer would reassemble the sequential bits into the original 8 -bit units. Compare PARALLEL TRANSFER.
