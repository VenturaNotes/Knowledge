- There are two possible contexts in the digital world where the term “shrink-wrapped” is used. Shrink-wrapped software may refer to one application or several bundled together, usually non-bespoke and not customized for the business in any way. It can also mean that the software license has not been “signed” yet. In most cases, this means that a company needs to use a code or digital form to register the software to themselves. Another term for this is “click-wrapped.” These meanings mirror the definition of shrink-wrapping outside the digital world, in which items are carefully and tightly packaged, often to ensure they're kept separate from other items.
