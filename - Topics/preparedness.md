- $n$. (in psychology) a quality of some stimuli that makes them much more likely to trigger a pathological fear. For example, animals or high places are much more likely to become the subject of a phobia than are plants or clothes. One theory is that individuals are genetically predisposed to conditioning of fear to objects that have been a biological threat during human evolution.
