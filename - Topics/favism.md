- $n$. an inherited defect in the enzyme glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase causing the red blood cells to become sensitive to a chemical in fava beans (broad beans). Eating these beans results in destruction of red blood cells (haemolysis), which may lead to severe anaemia, requiring blood transfusion.
