## Source [^1]
- An interview used in marketing research in which the interviewer asks the questions exactly as they appear on the questionnaire, adding and explaining nothing to the respondent. The questions can only be answered 'yes', 'no', or 'don't know'. Although this type of marketing research produces easily tabulated data quickly, it places a heavy burden on the designer of the questionnaire to ensure that the data is not misleading.
- Structured questionnaires and (less rigidly) structured interviews are also sometimes used in personnel selection.
