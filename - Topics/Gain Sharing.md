- Gain sharing is a way to incentivize third parties with a promise of business growth. Gains share or gain sharing can be between a business and a vendor, or a business and its employees. In either relationship, there are always benefits for both parties. As the profits of the business grow, so do the gains of the third party. The exact specifics of this will vary from contract to contract.
