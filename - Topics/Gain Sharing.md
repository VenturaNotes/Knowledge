- Gain sharing is a way to incentivize third parties with a promise of business growth. Gains share or gain sharing can be between a business and a vendor, or a business and its employees. In either relationship, there are always benefits for both parties. As the profits of the business grow, so do the gains of the third party. The exact specifics of this will vary from contract to contract.

- A form of output-based incentive that operates at company or workplace level. There are a variety of forms, including the Scanlon and Rucker plans and Improshare, but common to most is an attempt to link payment to a measure of value added. Here, value added is calculated by removing labor costs and expenditure on raw materials, energy, and support services from the income derived from the sale of the finished product. If value added increases above a target level, then it is shared between workforce and company in accordance with a preset formula. The aim is to create a group incentive that reflects the contribution of the work force to business performance more directly than profit-sharing schemes or profit-related pay.
