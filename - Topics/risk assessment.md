- (1) A systematic and disciplined approach to assessing the significance in terms of safety of the complete set of risks that may occur with a system
- (2) An assessment in quantitative terms of the damage that would be sustained if a computer system were exposed to postulated threats. A quantitative risk analysis may ascribe a probable financial loss if each specified threat successfully exploited each possible vulnerability of the system
## Source[^2]
- (in psychiatry) an assessment of the risk that a patient may pose at a given time, which is part of every mental state examination. Risk assessments are based primarily on past behaviour and certain aspects of current behaviour. They are usually divided into risk to the patient him- or herself, risk to others, and risk of neglect. Such assessments are more reliable for predicting short-term risk than long-term risk.
