- A curve defined as a function of independent variables. For example, a curve in 3-space may be thought of as the path of a moving point and can be described by the values of the position vector $\mathbf{r}$ at successive instants in time $t$. Adding higher-order terms in $t$ past the linear form gives curves of different complexity. If $t^{2}$ appears only, then it is a quadratic; if $t^{3}$ appears it is a cubic, and so on.
