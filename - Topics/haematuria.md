- $n$. the passage of blood in the urine. This may be seen by the naked eye (frank, macroscopic, or visible haematuria) or detected by urine microscopy or urine dipstick (microscopic or nonvisible haematuria) The latter is subclassified into symptomatic nonvisible or asymptomatic nonvisible haematuria. Haematuria is a very important symptom because it is associated with transitional cell carcinoma, most commonly in the bladder, and kidney cancer. It may also be due to urinary-tract infections, stone disease, or some forms of glomerulonephritis.
