- A SIM application toolkit (STK) is an ETSI standard. It allows developers to program additional information onto a SIM card. STK enables a SIM to execute actions that provide enhanced user functionality. That includes customized cell phone menus and interfaces. This standard allows phone users to access services from network operators and third-party providers such as mobile banking or news headlines. STKs send and receive commands between a phone and a network. They are independent of a phone's manufacturer and model.
