- n. A mental disorder characterized by amnesia, especially an impairment in ability to retain newly acquired information, typically accompanied by confabulation$\textendash$a tendency to invent explanations to cover areas of memory lossâ€”but with other cognitive functions usually well preserved, in contrast to dementia. It is caused by a deficiency of thiamine (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{1}$) usually resulting from alcohol dependence. Also called alcohol amnestic disorder or Korsakoff's syndrome. See also dorsomedial thalamus. \[Named after the Russian neuropsychiatrist Sergei Sergeievich Korsakoff (1854-1900) who first described it in 1887]
