- Dual-view displays are displays that use two different LCD screens. These screens use parallax barrier technology, which means that screens will show the same image from multiple angles. This will allow a variety of advanced visualization techniques to occur. They can also be used to make multitasking easier, as a person is able to quickly look back and forth between two different displays.
