## Source[^2]
- Application release automation (ARA) packages and deploys new or updated applications across multiple environments in an automated fashion. ARA tools provide IT teams, particularly software development and operations (DevOps), with a consistent method of releasing new or updated applications and associated configurations in less time, with better code testing and security. ARA, or application release orchestration, is necessary for practicing continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) in the software development lifecycle. Key components of ARA platforms include version control, release scheduling, and sandbox-based code testing.
