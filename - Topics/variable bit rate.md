## Source [^1]
- A stream of data in which the data arrives at a variable number of bits per second. For example, where data are to be transferred out of the memory of one computer system, across a network, and into the memory of a second computer system, it is perfectly feasible to suspend the transfer at some stage and to restart it later, without any detriment to the transfer. Such changes in the rate of delivery of data are not tolerable when transmitting digitally encoded speech. See also CODEC, CONSTANT BIT RATE.

## Source[^2]
- Variable Bit Rate (VBR) is a type of encoding that allows for more efficient bandwidth use by varying its bit rate depending on the material being encoded. It works well with video because it can reduce file size without sacrificing quality too much; however, this technique may not work well if there are different types of sounds within an audio track. VBRs come in two types: constant (CBR) and variable (VBR).
