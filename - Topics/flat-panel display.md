- (flat screen) A type of display device where the depth is much less than a conventional cathode-ray tube for the same image size. Various flat-panel technologies, including LCDs and plasma panels, are competing to produce reliable high-resolution colour displays, both large and small. As costs have fallen flat-panel displays have come to dominate the desktop market.
