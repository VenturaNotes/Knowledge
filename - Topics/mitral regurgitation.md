- (mitral incompetence) failure of the mitral valve to close, allowing a reflux of blood from the left ventricle of the heart to the left atrium. It may be due to mitral valve prolapse (MVP) in which one or both valve leaflets flop back into the left atrium (also known as 'floppy mitral valve'). It also results from chronic rheumatic scarring of the valve, or is secondary to left ventricular muscle damage. Its manifestations include breathlessness, atrial fibrillation, embolism, enlargement of the left ventricle, and a systolic murmur. Mild cases are symptomless and require no treatment, but in severe cases the affected valve should be repaired or replaced with an artificial one (mitral prosthesis).
