- The local habitat of a particular organism or microorganism. There are normally a number of different microhabitats within a large habitat (macrohabitat), each with its distinct set of environmental conditions. For example, in a stream macrohabitat there will exist different microhabitats, depending on oxygen content, pH , speed of water flow, and other factors in localized areas of the stream.
