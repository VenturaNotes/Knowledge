- A vector space V together with a Lie bracket, a map $V \times V \to V$ denoted by $[x, y]$ where $x,y \in V$, which is bilinear, alternating so that $[x, x] = 0$ for all $x$, and which satisfies Jacobi's identity. One example is $V = \mathbb{R}^3$ with the Lie bracket being the vector product. For any Lie group, the tangent space at the identity element is a Lie algebra. The Lie algebra of a Lie group G is often denoted in gothic as $\mathfrak g$
