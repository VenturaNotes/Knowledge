## Source [^1]
- A study carried out prior to a development project in order to establish whether the proposed system is feasible and can serve a useful purpose. Feasibility studies can be purely paper exercises or can involve the construction of experimental or prototype systems. Often a feasibility study will not address the entire scope of the proposed system, but will concentrate on specific areas where the feasibility is regarded as questionable or the potential risk is greatest.
