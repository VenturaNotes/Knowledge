- An insurance policy that pays a specified amount of money to the policyholder in the event of the loss of one or more eyes or limbs in any type of accident. It also pays a sum to the dependants of the policyholder in the event of his or her death. These policies first appeared in the early days of railway travel, when passengers felt a train journey was hazardous and they needed some protection for their dependants if they were to be killed or injured.
