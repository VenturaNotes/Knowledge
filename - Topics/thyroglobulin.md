## Source [^1]
- $n$. a protein in the thyroid gland from which the thyroid hormones (thyroxine and triiodotyrosine) are synthesized.
## Source[^2]
- (TGB) A glycoprotein, made in the thyroid gland, that consists of about 5000 amino acids, some of which are tyrosine residues. TGB is the precursor of the thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine. Iodine binds to the tyrosine residues in thyroglobulin, which is then hydrolysed into iodotyrosines that combine to form triiodothyronine $\left(\mathrm{T}_{3}\right)$ or thyroxine (tetraiodothyronine or $\mathrm{T}_{4}$).
