- Wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA) is a standard third-generation (3G) wireless communication technology that's used for digital mobile networks. Also known as wideband CDMA, it's a channel-access method that allows multiple transmitters to send both voice and data simultaneously over the same communication channel. WCDMA uses spread spectrum technology, which allows multiple users to share bandwidth with no interference. Users can also install WCDMA modems on their portable tablets, laptops, and other devices.
