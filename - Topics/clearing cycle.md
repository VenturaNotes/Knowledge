- The process by which a payment made by cheque, etc., through the banking system is transferred from the payer's to the payee's account. In the UK the average time for a cheque to be cleared for value is two working days. However, it may be another two working days before the cheque is cleared for withdrawal (i.e. before the payee can withdraw money against the funds transferred) and six working days in all before the cheque is cleared for fate.
