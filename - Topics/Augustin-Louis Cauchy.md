- (1789-1857) One of the most important mathematicians of the early 19th century. His work ranged enormously in almost 800 papers, but he is chiefly remembered as one of the founders of rigorous mathematical analysis. His Cours d'Analyse of 1821 is the first to involve epsilon-delta notation. He was also a pioneer of complex analysis, with many theorems carrying his name.
