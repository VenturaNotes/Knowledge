- $n$. A change in the pronunciation of English that took place at the end of the Middle Ages: most long vowels, such as the vowel in see (which before the shift rhymed with the modern French th√©), were raised, and the already close vowels in shine (which was pronounced like today's sheen) and mouse (which was pronounced like today's moose) became the diphthongs that they now are.
