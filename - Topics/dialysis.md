## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a method of separating particles of different dimensions in a liquid mixture, using a thin semipermeable membrane whose pores are too small to allow the passage of large particles, such as proteins, but large enough to permit the passage of dissolved crystalline material. A solution of the mixture is separated from distilled water by the membrane; the solutes pass through the membrane into the water while the proteins, etc., are retained. The principle of dialysis is used in the dialyser (see also HAEMODIALYSIS). The peritoneum is used as an autogenous semipermeable membrane in the technique of peritoneal dialysis.

- A method by which large molecules (such as starch or protein) and small molecules (such as glucose or amino acids) in solution may be separated by selective diffusion through a semipermeable membrane. For example, if a mixed solution of starch and glucose is placed in a closed container made of a semipermeable substance (such as Cellophane), which is then immersed in a beaker of water, the smaller glucose molecules will pass through the membrane into the water while the starch molecules remain behind. The plasma membranes of living organisms are partially permeable, and dialysis takes place naturally in the kidneys for the excretion of nitrogenous waste. An artificial kidney (dialyser) utilizes the principle of dialysis by taking over the functions of diseased kidneys.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The diffusion of small particles in a solution across a semipermeable membrane from the side where the solution is more concentrated to the side where it is less concentrated. Compare osmosis. \[From Greek dialysis a dissolution, from dia through or across + lysis a loosening]
