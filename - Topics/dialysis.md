- $n$. a method of separating particles of different dimensions in a liquid mixture, using a thin semipermeable membrane whose pores are too small to allow the passage of large particles, such as proteins, but large enough to permit the passage of dissolved crystalline material. A solution of the mixture is separated from distilled water by the membrane; the solutes pass through the membrane into the water while the proteins, etc., are retained. The principle of dialysis is used in the dialyser (see also HAEMODIALYSIS). The peritoneum is used as an autogenous semipermeable membrane in the technique of peritoneal dialysis.
