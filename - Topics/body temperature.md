- The temperature of the body, as measured by a thermometer. Body temperature is accurately controlled by a small area at the base of the brain (the hypothalamus); in normal individuals it is maintained at about $37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(98.4^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. Heat production by the body arises as the result of vital activities (e.g. respiration, heartbeat, circulation, secretion) and from the muscular effort of exercise and shivering. A rise in body temperature occurs in fever.
