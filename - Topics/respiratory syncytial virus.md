- (RSV) a paramyxovirus (see MYXOVIRUS) that causes infections of the nose and throat. It is a major cause of bronchiolitis and pneumonia in young children. In tissue cultures infected with the virus, cells merge together to form a conglomerate (syncytium). RSV is thought to have a role in sudden infant death syndrome. Vulnerable children can be treated with ribavirin, but most children just require supportive measures.
