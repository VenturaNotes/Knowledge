- $n$. an amide-type local anaesthetic used in dentistry. With a lower pKa of 7.8 (more rapid onset) and high lipid solubility (depth of anaesthesia), it is of significant benefit when infection is present. It also has the ability to penetrate bone. Although a causal relationship has not been proven, articaine has been associated with a higher risk of nerve damage when used as a block technique.
