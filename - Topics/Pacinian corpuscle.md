- (lamellated corpuscle) Any of certain sensory receptors that respond to pressure and vibration and are found in the subcutaneous layer of the skin, muscles, tendons, mesenteries, and joints of mammals. Each consists of a nerve ending surrounded by an oval capsule made of concentric layers of connective tissue. Pacinian corpuscles are fast adapting, and hence respond primarily to changes in pressure rather than sustained pressures. They are named after Italian anatomist Filipo Pacini (1812-83).

- $n$. A type of sensory nerve ending, the size and colour of a grain of rice, attached to the end of a single nerve fibre in the skin and joints, abundantly present along the sides of the fingers, in the palms, and in the joints, sensitive to pressure and vibration. Also called a Pacinian body, Pacini's corpuscle, or a Vater-Pacini corpuscle. See also pallaesthesia. Compare free nerve ending, Golgi tendon organ, Meissner's corpuscle, Merkel cell, Ruffini corpuscle. \[Named after the Italian anatomist Filippo Pacini (1812-83) who rediscovered it in the fingers in 1835 and gave a full description of it in 1840, although the German anatomist Abraham Vater (1684-1751) had discovered it some time prior to 1741]
