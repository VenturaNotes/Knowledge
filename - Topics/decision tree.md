- Decision trees are a kind of [[machine learning algorithm]] that can help with a wide variety of tasks. There are two kinds of decision trees:
	- A [[classification tree]] helps group items categorically such as grouping all of the passengers on the titanic into categories of "Survived" or "Didn't Survive"
	- A [[regression tree]] helps you predict a specific number along a continuous span, such as deciding a credit score based on an individual's history and behavior. 
- Decision trees are a basic model used for both classification and regression
	- When given training data to practice with, they can predict specific features about new data.
## Source[^2]
- A graphical representation of the choices in a decision-making process. A tree is composed of nodes, branches, and endpoints. Each node represents a point at which a decision has to be taken. The branches emanating from nodes are the alternatives from which a choice can be selected. Each endpoint of the tree has an associated value which is the pay-off from reaching that endpoint.

## Source[^3]
- A binary tree where every nonterminal node represents a decision. Depending upon the decision taken at such a node, control passes to the left or right subtree of the node. A leaf node then represents the outcome of taking the sequence of decisions given by the nodes on the path from the root to the leaf. See also BIFURCATION.
