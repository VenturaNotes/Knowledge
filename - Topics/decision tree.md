## Source [^1]
- Decision trees are a kind of [[machine learning algorithm]] that can help with a wide variety of tasks. There are two kinds of decision trees:
	- A [[classification tree]] helps group items categorically such as grouping all of the passengers on the titanic into categories of "Survived" or "Didn't Survive"
	- A [[regression tree]] helps you predict a specific number along a continuous span, such as deciding a credit score based on an individual's history and behavior. 
- Decision trees are a basic model used for both classification and regression
	- When given training data to practice with, they can predict specific features about new data.
## Source[^2]
- A graphical representation of the choices in a decision-making process. A tree is composed of nodes, branches, and endpoints. Each node represents a point at which a decision has to be taken. The branches emanating from nodes are the alternatives from which a choice can be selected. Each endpoint of the tree has an associated value which is the pay-off from reaching that endpoint.

## Source[^3]
- A binary tree where every nonterminal node represents a decision. Depending upon the decision taken at such a node, control passes to the left or right subtree of the node. A leaf node then represents the outcome of taking the sequence of decisions given by the nodes on the path from the root to the leaf. See also BIFURCATION.
## Source[^4]
- A diagram that illustrates the choices available to a decision maker and the estimated outcomes of each possible decision. Each possible decision is shown as a separate branch of the tree, together with each estimated outcome for each decision and the subjective probabilities of these outcomes actually occurring. From this information the expected values for each outcome can be determined, which can provide valuable information in decision making. For an example see the diagram.

	- Decision tree. A decision tree showing the outcome of a speculative sale and purchase of a commodity, assuming that there is an equal probability of a 10 point market rise and a 10 point market fall. It is assumed that there is a stop loss order to cover after an adverse market movement of 10 points, but profits are allowed to run.
