- Decision trees are a kind of [[machine learning algorithm]] that can help with a wide variety of tasks. There are two kinds of decision trees:
	- A [[classification tree]] helps group items categorically such as grouping all of the passengers on the titanic into categories of "Survived" or "Didn't Survive"
	- A [[regression tree]] helps you predict a specific number along a continuous span, such as deciding a credit score based on an individual's history and behavior. 
- Decision trees are a basic model used for both classification and regression
	- When given training data to practice with, they can predict specific features about new data.
