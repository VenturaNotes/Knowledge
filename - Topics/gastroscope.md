- $n$. an illuminated optical endoscope used to inspect the interior of the gullet (oesophagus), stomach, and duodenum. For many years these were rigid or semi-rigid instruments affording only limited views, but their modern counterparts are flexible instruments that house advanced digital systems to allow high-definition imaging of the oesophagus, stomach, and the proximal segments of the duodenum. Biopsies can be taken of visualized areas of mucosal abnormality, and therapeutic procedures (e.g. to stop a bleeding ulcer, remove a polyp, insert a gastrostomy, dilate a stricture, or insert a self-expandable metal stent) may be performed. As the same instruments can usually be introduced into the duodenum they are also known as gastroduodenoscopes or oesophagogastroduodenoscopes. $\textemdash$gastroscopy $n$.
