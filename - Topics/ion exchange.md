## Synthesis

- The exchange of ions of the same charge between a solution (usually aqueous) and a solid in contact with it. The process occurs widely in nature, especially in the absorption and retention of water-soluble fertilizers by soil. For example, if a potassium salt is dissolved in water and applied to soil, potassium ions are absorbed by the soil and sodium and calcium ions are released from it. The soil, in this case, is acting as an ion exchanger. Synthetic ion-exchange resins consist of various copolymers having a cross-linked three-dimensional structure to which ionic groups have been attached. An anionic resin has negative ions built into its structure and therefore exchanges positive ions. A cationic resin has positive ions built in and exchanges negative ions. Ion-exchange resins are used as the stationary phase in ion-exchange chromatography.
