- An acquisition plan is a business document that corporations use when attempting to procure and acquire certain assets, services, or even other organizations. Corporations use acquisition plans to outline all of the costs, needs, risks, qualities, drawbacks, and benefits related to a new company acquisition. Mapping out the fine details of an acquisition using an acquisition plan helps companies mitigate the various financial and legal risks associated with acquiring new assets, services, or other corporations.
