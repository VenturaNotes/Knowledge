- (Kawasaki syndrome, mucocutaneous lymph node syndrome) a condition of unknown cause affecting young children, usually less than five years old and most commonly of Japanese or Korean descent, and characterized by fever, conjunctivitis, a sore throat, and a generalized rash and reddening of the palms and soles. This is followed by peeling of the fingers and toes. The fever usually persists for 1-2 weeks. In approximately one-fifth of children there is involvement of the coronary arteries and heart muscle (myocardium), resulting in myocarditis and aneurysms of the coronary arteries. About 2% of cases are fatal. The aneurysms will usually resolve spontaneously but slowly. Treatment involves aspirin therapy, and gammaglobulin reduces the risk of coronary artery disease. \[T. Kawasaki (20th century), Japanese physician]
