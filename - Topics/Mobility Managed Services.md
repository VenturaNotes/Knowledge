- Mobility managed services (MMS) describe the IT and process management services used by a company to acquire and support mobile devices. The goal of MMS is to improve 'mobility' in an organization, where employees use technologies to move around more freely and improve productivity. MMS devices include smartphones, tablets, and hard-wearing technology used by field force workers. Although the MMS market largely caters to devices purchased by a company, MMS also supports technology purchased by individuals and bring-your-own devices that access a company's data and resources.
