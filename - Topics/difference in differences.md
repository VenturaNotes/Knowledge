- A method of estimation of the causal effect of a treatment, or a policy intervention, using panel data. The estimation is based on the calculation of the difference between the average changes over time in the variable of interest, or the treatment outcome, for two samples: those who did receive the treatment and those who did not. If the treatment is exogenous to the sample, the causal effect is identified.
