It moved to the University of Chicago in 1939, and to Yale University in 1955, when it was renamed the Cowles Foundation. The major contributions of the Cowles Commission have been in the fields of econometrics and general equilibrium theory. Many economists have been awarded Bank of Sweden Prizes (Nobel prizes in economics) for work undertaken at the commission.
