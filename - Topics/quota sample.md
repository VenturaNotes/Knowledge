- A sample including representatives of different sections of the population being sampled in fixed proportions, but not necessarily the same proportions as the overall population. This applies, for example, to choosing people from different sex and age groups. This is intended to ensure that particular groups are represented in the sample, although the sample may not be representative of the population. See also RANDOM SAMPLE; STRATIFIED SAMPLE.
