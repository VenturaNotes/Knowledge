- $n$. in law, the unlawful killing of a person that does not amount to murder owing to the absence of malicious intent. It comprehends both voluntary manslaughter, where the killing was a deliberate act but is held to have arisen from diminished responsibility (i.e. from an abnormality of mind that does not amount to insanity), and involuntary manslaughter, where the killing was an accident arising from recklessness or gross negligence. In rare cases, medical professionals have been convicted of the involuntary manslaughter of their patients.
