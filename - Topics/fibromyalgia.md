- $n$. a disorder characterized by pain in the fibrous tissue components of muscles without any inflammation (compare FIBROMYOSITIS). Widespread aching and stiffness with specific tender points are accompanied by extreme fatigue and often associated with headache, numbness and tingling, and various other symptoms. Fibromyalgia is frequently triggered by anxiety, stress, sleep deprivation, and straining or overuse of muscles; it appears to be closely related to CFS/ME/PVF.
