- $n$. In logic, a theorem of semantic entailment in propositional calculus according to which if a set of premises $P$ entails a conclusion $q$, then the addition of further premises from a larger set $S$ that includes $P$ cannot affect the truth of the conclusion $q$. The theorem underpins the monotonicity of logic. See also default reasoning, non-MONOTONIC REASONING.
