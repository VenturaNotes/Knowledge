- adj. Of, relating to, or consisting of a distorted image that regains its correct proportions when viewed from a particular angle or in a curved mirror. An anamorphic picture or image is usually so distorted that it is difficult or impossible to interpret with normal viewing, but when examined with an anamorphoscope (usually a polished cylinder or cone), or when viewed at a steep slant, the distortion is corrected and the normal proportions of the image are restored, the most famous example in fine art being The Ambassadors painted in 1533 by the German artist Hans Holbein the Younger (1497-1543), which contains an elongated human skull that becomes recognizable only when the painting is viewed from its edge at a downward angle of 27 degrees. \[From Greek ana back or again + morphe a shape or form + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
