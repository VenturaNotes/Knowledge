- $n$. the formation of dentine by odontoblasts. Although dentinogenesis continues throughout life, very little dentine is formed later than a few years after tooth eruption unless it is stimulated by caries, abrasion, or trauma. Dentinogenesis imperfecta is a hereditary condition in which dentine formation is disturbed; this may result in loss of overlying enamel and excessive wear of the dentine.
