- The six major areas that can be used to build a power base by a person or unit working in a large organization:
	- Political network$\textemdash$support is built up by communication with peers, subordinates, and those not in direct authority. This method is dependent on the person's communication channels within an organization.
	- Perception of dependence$\textemdash$support comes from the belief that the person controls scarce resources and has the power to allocate them.
	- Work unit power$\textemdash$power deriving from a department's ability to deal with uncertainty, the uniqueness of its functions, changes in its external environment, etc.
	- Work activities$\textemdash$power arising by exploiting the visible and necessary differences within the organization.
	- Charisma$\textemdash$a person who is continuously successful, especially one who takes high risks, often comes to be highly regarded by others, who become inspired by his or her ideas and committed to implement them (see CHARISMATIC LEADER; TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP). This in turn strengthens the person's knowledge, reputation, and credibility.
