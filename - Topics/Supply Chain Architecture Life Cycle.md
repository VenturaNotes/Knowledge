- Supply chain architecture life cycle (SCALe) is a process that helps businesses manage and optimize their supply chains by taking into account their strategic objectives and current capabilities and limitations. SCALe considers the life cycle of every supply chain capability, including its inception, design, launch (physical, financial, and digital), use for delivery of orders, performance tracking, improvement, and eventual retirement of the processes, structures, and governance associated with that capacity.
