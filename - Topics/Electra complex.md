- n. In analytical psychology, the female Oedipus complex. Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) introduced the term in an article in 1913 in the Jahrbuch f√ºr psychoanalytische und psychopathologische Forschungen, although Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) stated in 1920 that he did not consider the term useful (Standard Edition, XVIII, p. 155n), and in an article on 'Female Sexuality' in 1931, he went further in denying the existence of such a complex: 'It is only in the male child that we find the fateful combination of love for one parent and simultaneous hatred for the other as a rival' (Standard Edition, XXI, pp. 225-43, at p. 229). See also complex (2). \[Named after Electra in Greek mythology who arranged for the murder of her mother Clytemnestra, who in turn had murdered Electra's father Agamemnon]
