- $n$. a genetically determined skin disorder (see GENODERMATOSIS) in which there is abnormal scaling of the skin (the scaly condition of the skin is reflected in the name of this disorder, which is derived from the Greek word for fish). Ichthyosis may be caused by a variety of genetic defects in skin shedding; the pattern of scaling varies according to the underlying defect. The commonest form, ichthyosis vulgaris, is inherited as an autosomal dominant and occurs in 1 in 300 of the population. Lamellar ichthyosis is a very rare condition in which the skin, particularly on the palms and soles, is thickened and lizard-like. Treatment of ichthyosis is mainly by the regular use of emollients. See also XERODERMA.
