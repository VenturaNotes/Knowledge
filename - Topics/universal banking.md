- Banking that involves not only services related to loans and savings (retail or commercial banking) but also trading on financial markets and making investments in companies. Universal banking has traditionally been most common in Germany, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. The Glass-Steagall Act 1933 prohibited universal banking in the USA, but the restrictions placed on it were effectively removed in 1999. In the UK it was largely avoided until the late 1990s, after which there was rapid expansion in the trading activities of leading banks. In the wake of the financial crisis of 2007-08 there have been growing calls for a renewed separation between retail and investment banking.
