- Unemployment which is deliberately chosen by the person unemployed. An unemployed person may refrain from applying for jobs which they could have got had they applied, or may apply in such a way as to be refused the offer of a job. This could be because they do not want to work at all, at least at the present time, or because they do want to work, but are searching for a better job opportunity.
