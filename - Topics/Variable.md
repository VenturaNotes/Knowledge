- Line 4 consists of a variable
	- A variable is a location in memory to store a value that may change (as the program is running)

## Source[^2]
- A storage location paired with an associated symbolic name, which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value. Variables are fundamental in programming for storing and manipulating data.

## Source[^3]
- (1) A unit of storage that can be modified during program execution, usually by assignment or read operations. A variable is generally denoted by an identifier or by a name. 
- (2) The name that denotes a modifiable unit of storage. 
- (3) See PARAMETER. 
- (4) (in logic) a name that can stand for any of a possibly infinite set of values.
## Source[^4]
- A characteristic of a product or service that can be measured on a continuously variable scale, e.g. length, weight, time, price. Compare ATTRIBUTE.
## Source[^5]
- A quantity which is liable to change. Economic variables may measure prices, interest rates, income levels, quantities of goods, etc. An exogenous variable is one where the changes originate from causes outside the scope of a given model; an endogenous variable is determined within the model. See also RANDOM VARIABLE.
## Source[^6]
- $n$. (in statistics) any characteristic (e.g. age, lifestyle, or habit) relating to an individual or group that can take a number of different values. Categorical or qualitative variables are descriptive characteristics, such as sex, race, or occupation; quantitative variables relate to a numerical scale and are subdivided into discrete variables, found only at fixed points (e.g. number of children), and continuous variables, found at any point on a scale (e.g. weight). See also CONFOUNDING; CORRELATION.
