- The two self-dual laws$$\begin{aligned}& x \vee(x \wedge y)=x \\& x \wedge(x \vee y)=x\end{aligned}$$(see DUALITY) that are satisfied by all elements $x, y$ in a Boolean algebra possessing the two operations $\lor$ and $\land$.

## Source[^2]
- For all sets $A$ and $B$, $$A\cap(A\cup B)=A \text{ and }A \cup(A \cap B)=A.$$These are the absorption laws.
