- Latin for 'first do no harm', a traditional medical aphorism, similar to the Greek for 'abstain from doing harm' in the Hippocratic Oath and also to the prima facie principle of nonmaleficence. It is a reminder to first consider whether a proposed medical intervention risks causing more harm than good. See also RISK-BENEFIT ANALYSIS.
