- surgical excision of the anal sphincter, rectum, and part of the sigmoid colon because of cancer involving the anal canal or the lower third of the rectum. The remaining length of sigmoid colon is brought through the abdominal wall (see COLOSTOMY; STOMA). This procedure may be performed using abdominal and perineal incisions or laparoscopically; it is indicated for tumors close to the anal canal and in patients with poor sphincter function.
