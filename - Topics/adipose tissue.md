- A body tissue comprising cells containing fat and oil. It is found chiefly below the skin (see SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE) and around major organs (such as the kidneys and heart), acting as an energy reserve, providing insulation and protection, and generating heat. Secretion of the hormone leptin by adipose tissue regulates the amount of adipose tissue and adjusts the body's energy balance. See BROWN FAT; THERMOGENESIS.

- fibrous connective tissue packed with masses of fat cells (adipocytes). In human adults it consists mostly of white fat (see also BROWN FAT). It forms a thick layer under the skin and occurs around the kidneys and in the buttocks. It serves both as an insulating layer and an energy store; food in excess of requirements is converted into fats and stored within these cells.
