- A body tissue comprising cells containing fat and oil. It is found chiefly below the skin (see SUBCUTANEOUS TISSUE) and around major organs (such as the kidneys and heart), acting as an energy reserve, providing insulation and protection, and generating heat. Secretion of the hormone leptin by adipose tissue regulates the amount of adipose tissue and adjusts the body's energy balance. See BROWN FAT; THERMOGENESIS.
