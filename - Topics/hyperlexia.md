- $n$. A reading disorder characterized by advanced wordrecognition skills in a person with pronounced cognitive and language deficits. People with hyperlexia manifest word-recognition skills by their ability to pronounce single words presented to them out of context, but they lack the ability to understand printed words and texts and therefore have poor reading comprehension. The condition was first identified and named by Norman E(sau) Silberberg (1931-2007) and Margaret C. Silberberg (1927-82) in 1967. See also attentional dyslexia, dyslexia. \[From Greek hyper over + lexis a word + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
