- A condition that occurs when a process which is waiting for either an external event or the expiry of a preset time interval reaches the end of the time interval before the external event is detected. For example, if the process has sent a message and no acknowledgment has been detected at the end of the preset time period, then the process may take appropriate action, such as retransmitting the message.
- The word is also used as a verb.
