## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A collection of information, referred to by file name; for example, a user-created document, program data, or the program itself. With a program, the information is held on backing store (i.e. usually on magnetic disk) in order (a) to enable it to persist beyond the time of execution of a single job and/or (b) to overcome space limitations in main memory. Files with a very brief existence (i.e. in case (b) above, or where they simply carry information between one job and the next in sequence) are called [[work file|work files]]. See also DATA FILE, MASTER FILE.
## Source[^2]
- A file (also referenced as a computer file) is a collection of data stored on a computer system under a unique filename. There are various categories of files; the most widely used file types include document files, image files, audio files, video files, log files, software library files, and application files.
- Each file category contains various file formats. For example, image files contain an array of formats such as JPEGs, GIFs, BMPs, or PNGs. Computer users can determine a file's format by viewing either its file icon or its file extension (which is often a part of its file naming scheme).
- Files can be opened, saved, deleted, and organized in file folders. In a business setting, employees typically transfer files throughout their organization over a company network as a means of information sharing.
