- A generalization of the concept of a graph in which each edge is associated not with the normal two vertices but with an ordered set of $n$ vertices; such an edge is known as a hyperedge and $n$ is the type of that edge. The hyperedges thus relate an arbitrary number of vertices in a given subset of the graph.
