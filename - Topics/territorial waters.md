- The part of the sea around a country's coastline over which it has jurisdiction according to international law. Historically, it was the sea within three nautical miles of the coast, a practical distance determined by the range of a cannon ball. Since disputes have arisen over fishing rights, off-shore oil mining, and mineral rights below the ocean, the universal three-mile rule has been abrogated and various nations have made different claims, some, but not all, of which have been accepted internationally. Ten to fifteen nautical miles is now quite common in definitions of territorial waters. The Territorial Sea Act 1987 fixes the UK territorial waters at 12 nautical miles. The UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982) defines a 200-mile exclusive economic zone, giving a country sovereign rights over all the resources of the sea, seabed, and subsoil within this zone. To date, this Convention has been subscribed to by 148 nations, including the UK.
