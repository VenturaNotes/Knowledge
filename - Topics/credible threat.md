- A threat that the maker is expected to carry out. $A$ 's threat to $B$ is that if $B$ acts in certain ways, $A$ will harm $B$. This threat is credible only if it is rational for $B$ to believe that $A$ will carry it out; if the threatened action also harms $A$, the threat will not seem credible to $B$. This holds unless $B$ believes that $A$ will feel that loss of credibility from failure to carry out the threat is even worse than the direct effects of the action itself. A reputation for ruthlessness or even irrationality thus makes threats more credible.
