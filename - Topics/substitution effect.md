- The effect on the demand for good $i$ of an increase in the price of good $j$ when the consumer is compensated sufficiently to remain at the same level of utility. The substitution effect is determined by a move along an indifference curve. Hence, the substitution effect of an increase in a good's own price is always non-positive, and is strictly negative whenever any substitution is possible. See also SlutSKY EQUATION.
