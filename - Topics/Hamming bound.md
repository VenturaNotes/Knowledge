- (sphere-packing bound) The theorem that the number, $N$, of codewords in a binary linear code is bounded by

  

$$

N \leq 2^{n} \int_{r \geq 0}^{\xi}\binom{n}{r}

$$

  

where the code length is $n$ digits, and the code is capable of correcting $e$ errors. See also CODING BOUNDS, GILBERT-VARSHAMOV BOUND.
