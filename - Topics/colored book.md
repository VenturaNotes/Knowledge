- The UK academic networking community was one of the earliest to attempt to devise a complete set of open systems interconnection (OSI) standards for all aspects of its networking requirements, and to make a concerted effort to apply these to the entire community. A main thrust of the approach was the definition of protocols for each of the major networking requirements, each protocol being issued in a different colored binder. The important protocols were:

| Protocols   | Description                                                                                        |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Yellow Book | defining a transport service, roughly equivalent to layer 4 of the ISO seven-layer reference model |
| Green Book  | defining a terminal connection protocol                                                            |
| Blue Book   | defining a file transfer protocol                                                                  |
| Grey Book   | defining an electronic mail service                                                                |
| Red Book    | defining a job transfer and submission protocol                                                    |
| Pink Book   | defining a transport service to run over an ISO OSI CSMA/CD service                                |
| Orange Book | defining a network service running over a Cambridge Ring                                           |
- Colors have been used to identify various other standards, including CD-ROM format standards.
