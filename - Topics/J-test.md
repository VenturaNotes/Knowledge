- A test of overidentifying restrictions in the generalized method of moments (GMM) model. The test statistic is the sum of weighted squared deviations of the sample moments evaluated at the GMM estimates, and under the null hypothesis of the restrictions it has asymptotically chi-square distribution with the number of degrees of freedom equal to the number of restrictions tested.
