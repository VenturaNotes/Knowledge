- $n$. a recombinant protease with activity against components of the interface between the retina and the vitreous humour, used for treatment of symptomatic vitreomacular adhesion. It works by dissolving the proteins that link the vitreous to the macula in this condition, thus preventing posterior detachment of the vitreous from the retina (see RETINAL DETACHMENT).
