- A sparse matrix in which the nonzero elements are located in a band about the main diagonal. If $A$ is a band matrix such that$$\begin{aligned}& a_{i j}=0 \text { if } j-i>p \\& \text { or } i-j>q\end{aligned}$$where $p$ and $q$ are the distances above and below the main diagonal, then the bandwidth $\mathbf{w}$ is given by$$w=p+q+1$$
