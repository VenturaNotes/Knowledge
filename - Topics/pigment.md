- $n$. a substance giving color. Physiologically important pigments include the blood pigments (especially haemoglobin), bile pigments, and retinal pigment (see RHODOPSIN). The pigment melanin occurs in the skin and in the iris of the eye. Important plant pigments include chlorophyll and the carotenoids.

- A compound that gives color to a tissue. Pigments perform a variety of functions. For example, haemoglobin in vertebrate erythrocytes gives blood its characteristic red color and enables the transport of oxygen throughout the body (see RESPIRATORY PIGMENT). Other biological pigments include chlorophyll, a photosynthetic pigment in plants that is responsible for their green coloration; and melanin, a brown pigment in animals that provides protection from ultraviolet light and can be used in camouflaging colorations. See also RHODOPSIN.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any substance, including the visual pigments contained in the rods and cones in the retina of the eye, whose constituent molecules absorb some wavelengths of light and reflect others. See also chromophore. \[From Latin pigmentum painted, from pingere to paint]
