- a superficial reflex in males elicited by stroking the inner side of the upper thigh with a sharp object. If the reflex is intact the scrotum on that side is pulled upwards as the cremaster muscle contracts. Absence or reduction of both cremasteric reflexes indicates an upper motor neuron lesion; absence of the reflex on one side suggests a lower motor neuron lesion at the level of the first lumbar spinal nerve.
