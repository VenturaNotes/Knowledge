- Database encryption is a type of data security that protects the contents of an entire database from unauthorized access. The process involves encrypting all information in the database using an encryption key so that only those with access to it can read what's inside. It also prevents hackers from stealing sensitive information such as credit card numbers or Social Security Numbers (SSNs). It is important to note that multiple types of database encryptions are available, each with its benefits and drawbacks. Some common database encryption types include external database encryption, column-level encryption, full database encryption, and more.
