- $n$. an RNA-containing virus that can convert its genetic material into DNA by means of the enzyme reverse transcriptase, which enables it to become integrated into the DNA of its host's cells. Retroviruses have been implicated in the development of some cancers and are associated with conditions characterized by an impaired immune system (HIV is a retrovirus). They are also used as vectors in gene therapy.

- An RNA-containing virus that converts its RNA into DNA by means of the enzyme reverse transcriptase; this enables it to become integrated into its host's DNA as a provirus. Some retroviruses can cause cancer in animals: they contain oncogenes (cancercausing genes), which are activated when the virus enters its host cell and starts to replicate. Also, their insertion into the host genome may activate growth-promoting host genes abnormally. The special properties of retroviruses make them useful as vectors for inserting genetic material into eukaryotic cells. The best-known retrovirus is HIV, responsible for AIDS in humans.
