- $n$. an inability to make skilled movements with accuracy. This is a disorder of the cerebral cortex resulting in the patient's inability to organize the movements rather than clumsiness due to weakness, sensory loss, or disease of the cerebellum. It is most often caused by disease of the dominant parietal lobe of the brain and sometimes by disease of the frontal lobe, causing, for example, difficulty in walking (gait apraxia).
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A loss or diminution in ability, caused by neurological impairment usually in the left hemisphere of the brain, to perform purposeful bodily movements or gestures (1) on request, though often with apparently unimpaired ability to perform them when they arise in natural contexts (such as when circumstances call for waving goodbye to someone), the impairment not being due to paralysis or poor comprehension. The major forms are: akinetic apraxia (impaired ability to perform a spontaneous gesture); amnesic apraxia (impaired ability to perform purposeful bodily movements or gestures on request because of amnesia for the request, also written amnestic apraxia); constructional apraxia (impaired ability to copy simple drawings or patterns); dressing apraxia (impaired ability to dress); gait apraxia (impaired ability to walk); ideational apraxia (impaired ability to repeat previously well-established actions); ideomotor apraxia (impaired ability to imitate unfamiliar actions, also called motor apraxia or ideokinetic apraxia); left-sided apraxia (impaired ability to carry out verbal requests with the left side of the body, resulting from damage to the corpus callosum preventing impulses from the left hemisphere reaching the right motor cortex, also called callosal apraxia, sympathetic apraxia, unilateral limb apraxia); oculomotor apraxia (impaired ability to make eye movements, also called ocular apraxia or optic apraxia); oral apraxia (impaired ability to perform actions of the mouth and tongue, such as opening the mouth or protruding the tongue); paramimia (impaired ability to gesture); sensory apraxia (another name for ideational apraxia); speech apraxia (impaired ability to speak, without other language impairments). See also adiadochokinesia, alien hand sign, KINESICS. \[From Greek apraxia inaction, from $a$- without + praxis a deed or action + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
