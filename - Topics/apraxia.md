- $n$. an inability to make skilled movements with accuracy. This is a disorder of the cerebral cortex resulting in the patient's inability to organize the movements rather than clumsiness due to weakness, sensory loss, or disease of the cerebellum. It is most often caused by disease of the dominant parietal lobe of the brain and sometimes by disease of the frontal lobe, causing, for example, difficulty in walking (gait apraxia).
