- $n$. the process by which mature spermatozoa are produced in the testis (see illustration). Spermatogonia, in the outermost layer of the seminiferous tubules, multiply throughout reproductive life. Some of them divide by meiosis into spermatocytes, which produce haploid spermatids. These are transformed into mature spermatozoa by the process of spermiogenesis. The whole process takes 70-80 days.

## Source[^2]
- The series of cell divisions in the testis that results in the production of spermatozoa. Within the seminiferous tubules of the testis germ cells grow and divide by mitosis to produce spermatogonia. These divide by mitosis to produce spermatocytes, which divide by meiosis to produce spermatids. The spermatids, which thus have half the number of chromosomes of the original germ cells, then develop into spermatozoa.
