- $n$. the process by which mature spermatozoa are produced in the testis (see illustration). Spermatogonia, in the outermost layer of the seminiferous tubules, multiply throughout reproductive life. Some of them divide by meiosis into spermatocytes, which produce haploid spermatids. These are transformed into mature spermatozoa by the process of spermiogenesis. The whole process takes 70-80 days.
