- A local area network in which (some of) the physical links are carried by a free-space signaling system. Much of the cost of a LAN lies in the final flexible link between the network outlet, which is wired in as a fixed part of the fabric, and the actual end-user device such as a PC or workstation. The presence of this link also places restrictions on the location of equipment. A WLAN replaces this final link by a free-space link, using either infrared (very occasionally, most generally in an informal setting) or microwave as a carrier, allowing freedom of movement for the user and a simplified wiring installation for the fixed wiring.
