- $n$. inturning of the eyelid towards the eyeball. The lashes may rub against the eye and cause irritation (see TRICHIASIS). The commonest type is spastic entropion of the lower eyelid, due to spasm of the muscle that closes the eye (orbicularis oculi). Entropion may also be caused by scarring of the lining membrane (conjunctiva) of the lid.
