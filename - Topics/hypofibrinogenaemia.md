- (fibrinogenopenia) $n$. a deficiency of the clotting factor fibrinogen in the blood, which results in an increased tendency to bleed. It may occur as an inherited disorder in which either production of fibrinogen is impaired or the fibrinogen produced does not function in the normal way (dysfibrinogenaemia). Alternatively, it may be acquired. For example, it is the commonest cause of blood coagulation failure during pregnancy, when the blood fibrinogen level falls below the normal pregnancy level of $4-6 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ as a result of disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). This usually occurs as a complication of severe abruptio placentae, prolonged retention of a dead fetus, or amniotic fluid embolism.
