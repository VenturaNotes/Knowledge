- $n$. poisoning by beryllium or its compounds, either by inhalation or by skin contamination. Inhalation of fumes from molten beryllium causes an acute alveolitis and is usually fatal. Subacute and chronic forms can result from extremely low levels of exposure to the powder and can produce granulomata in the skin or lungs very similar to those seen in sarcoidosis. In the lungs, these lead to fibrosis, which can, however, be prevented by prompt use of oral corticosteroids. Although the incidence of berylliosis has been greatly reduced since the use of beryllium compounds in the manufacture of fluorescent light tubes was discontinued in Britain in 1948, new cases are still occurring.
