- A variable whose value is determined by the equilibrium of a system, in contrast to an exogenous variable that is imposed on a system from outside. For example, the resource endowments of an economy are exogenous, whereas equilibrium prices are endogenous. In the context of econometrics, an endogenous variable is correlated with the error term in the regression equation. See also ENDOGENEITY PROBLEM.
