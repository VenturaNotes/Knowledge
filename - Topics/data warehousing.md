- Computer technology enabling data from multiple operational processing systems to be brought together into a single source, which can then be accessed and interrogated. The data can be both current and historical. Warehousing differs from previous management information systems in that designers do not need to think about what questions might be asked of the system. The data is held in detail, rather than prespecified categories; it is therefore possible to ask questions and to relate variables that may never have seemed relevant before, without having to interrupt ongoing operational processes. See also DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM; EXPERT SYSTEM; ONLINE ANALYTICAL PROCESSING.
