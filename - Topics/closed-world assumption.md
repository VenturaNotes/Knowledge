- An approach for dealing with incompleteness in artificial intelligence. In a logic knowledge base, all facts are taken to be either true or false. Any items that have unknown truth values cannot be represented without awkward modifications. The closed-world assumption deals with this by assuming that anything that is not contained within the knowledge base is false; in other words, unknown is equivalent to false.
