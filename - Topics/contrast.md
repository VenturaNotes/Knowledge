- n. 
- (1) short for contrast medium, e.g. post-contrast CT scan. 
- (2) the difference in the shade of grey between different tissues on a diagnostic image, such as radiograph or CT scan (see GREY SCALE).

- $n$. 
- (1) A distinction between things being compared, or an emphasis on the distinction between things that are juxtaposed. 
- (2) In perception, an enhancement of the perceived differences between stimuli resulting from juxtaposing them. In simultaneous contrast the stimuli are presented together; in successive contrast they are presented sequentially. See color CONTRAST, LIGHTNESS CONTRAST, WARMTH CONTRAST. See also CONTRAST RATIO. 
- (3) In statistics, a comparison of two or more means calculated by forming a weighted linear combination of means. For example, the contrast $1 / 2$ (Mean 1) $+1 / 2($Mean 2) - (Mean 3) could be used to test the null hypothesis that the average of Mean 1 and Mean 2 is equal to Mean 3 in the population. In most cases it is necessary for statistical reasons for the contrast to be orthogonal (3), with the coefficients summing to zero, as are the coefficients of $\frac 12,\frac 12$, and -1 in this example. 
- (4) The degree to which areas of an optical image, such as those in television or photographic pictures, differ in luminance, often indexed by $\left(L_{\max }-L_{\min }\right) /\left(L_{\max }+L_{\min }\right)$, where $L_{\text {max }}$ is a measure of the luminance of the brightest area and $L_{\text {min }}$ the luminance of the darkest area. See also contrast ratio, contrast threshold. 
- (5) Exaggerating or increasing the discrepancy between one's own attitude and that of a source of a persuasive communication or message. See also assimilation-contrast theory. Compare assimilation (4).
