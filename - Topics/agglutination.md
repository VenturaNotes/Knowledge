- The clumping together by antibodies of microscopic foreign particles, such as red blood cells or bacteria, so that they form a visible pellet-like precipitate. Agglutination is a specific reaction, i.e. a particular antigen will only clump in the presence of its specific antibody; it therefore provides a means of identifying unknown bacteria and determining blood group. When blood of incompatible blood groups (e.g. group A and group B$\textemdash$see ABO SYSTEM) is mixed together agglutination of the red cells occurs (haemagglutination). This is due to the reaction between antibodies in the plasma (agglutinins) and agglutinogens (antigens) on the surface of the red cells.

- (clumping) $n$. the sticking together, by serum antibodies called agglutinins, of such microscopic antigenic particles as red blood cells or bacteria so that they form visible clumps. Any substance that stimulates the body to produce an agglutinin is called an agglutinogen. Agglutination is a specific reaction; in the laboratory, sera containing different known agglutinins provide an invaluable means of identifying unknown bacteria. When blood of different groups is mixed, agglutination occurs because serum contains natural antibodies (isoagglutinins) that attack red cells of a foreign group, whether previously encountered or not. This is not the same process as occurs in blood coagulation.
