- (luxation) $n$. displacement from their normal position of bones meeting at a joint such that there is complete loss of contact of the joint surfaces. It usually results from trauma (e.g. dislocation of the shoulder, which is common in sports injuries, and dislocation of the mandible from the temporomandibular joint) but may be congenital, in which case it usually affects the hip (see CONGENITAL DISLOCATION OF THE HIP). In a traumatic dislocation the bones are restored to their normal positions by manipulation under local or general anaesthesia (see REDUCTION). Compare SUBLUXATION.
