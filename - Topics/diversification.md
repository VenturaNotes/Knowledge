- (1) A spread of the activities of a firm or a country between different types of products or different markets. The truly single-product firm is highly exceptional and practically all firms are diversified to some extent. The advantage of diversified markets is that a firm or country will be at less risk, as its markets are unlikely all to slump at the same time.
- (2) The division of an investment portfolio between a range of financial assets. If the assets in the portfolio are correctly selected diversification can reduce risk.

- (2) The spreading of an investment portfolio over a wide range of assets to avoid serious losses if a recession is localized to one sector of the market.
