- Termination of employment, for whatever reason. Quits may be initiated by the employee leaving voluntarily, for example to take a better job, or by the employer if an employee is unsatisfactory or redundant. Quits initiated by employees tend to be more common in booms than in slumps; quits initiated by employers tend to be higher in slumps than in booms.
