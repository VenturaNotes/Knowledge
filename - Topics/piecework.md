- The system of pay by which a worker's wages are proportional to the quantity of output produced. This system is suitable only when a worker's output can be reliably measured, and when variations do not arise from factors over which the worker has no control, for example late delivery of materials. It can be contrasted with time rates, where pay simply depends on hours worked.
