- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a defence mechanism in which emotion is detached from an idea and rendered unconscious, leaving the idea bland and emotionally flat. It is especially important in obsessive-compulsive disorder, and in non-disordered people it most often occurs following a traumatic experience. The mechanisms by which the detachment is effected include repetitive intrusive thoughts and ritualistic behaviour. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) expressed his ideas about isolation most clearly in his book Inhibitions, Symptoms and Anxiety (1926, Standard Edition, XX, pp. 77-175, at pp. 120-2). Also called isolation. See also DECATHEXIS.
