- $n$. a disease, common in the tropics and subtropics, caused by the presence in the lymph vessels of the parasitic nematode worms Wuchereria bancrofti and Brugia malayi (see filariA). The worms, which are transmitted to humans by various mosquitoes (including AÃ«des, Culex, Anopheles, and Mansonia), bring about inflammation and eventual blocking of lymph vessels, which causes the surrounding tissues to swell (see ELEPHANTIASIS). The rupture of urinary lymphatics may lead to the presence of chyle in the urine. Filariasis is treated with the drug diethylcarbamazine.
