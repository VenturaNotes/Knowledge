- arg is the abbreviation and symbol for the argument of a complex number
- Suppose that the complex number z is represented by the point P in the complex plane. The argument of z, denoted by arg z, is the angle $\theta$ (in radians) that OP makes with the positive real axis Ox, with the angle given a positive sense anticlockwise from $Ox$. Principal values of $\theta$ may be taken so that $0 \le \text{arg } z \lt 2\pi$, or $-\pi < \text{arg } z \le \pi$, or alternatively arg $z$ may be used to denote any of the values $\theta + 2n\pi$, where $n$ is an integer.
