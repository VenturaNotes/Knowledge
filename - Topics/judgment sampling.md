- A form of non-probability sampling in which a researcher selects a sample from a population on the basis of his or her judgment, rather than by using statistical sampling techniques. For example, in marketing research an interviewer might interview a woman with a child because the questions relate to children's clothing. Although such an approach can be valuable in qualitative marketing research, its drawback is that it does not permit an inference from the sample to a larger population.
