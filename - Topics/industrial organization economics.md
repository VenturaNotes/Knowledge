- An approach to microeconomics that focuses on the strategic behavior of firms in a state of imperfect competition. In particular, it explores the ways in which different market forms (e.g. monopolistic competition, oligopoly, monopoly) demand different competitive strategies in such areas as production, pricing, marketing and advertising, and investment. The role of government regulation is also analysed. Although highly theoretical in many respects, the field has direct applications in strategic management and government competition policy. In recent decades it has been much influenced by game theory and behavioral finance. See also STRUCTURE-CONDUCT-PERFORMANCE MODEL.
