- $n$. The study of the role of gestures (1) and other body movements in non-verbal communication. Gestures are often classified into emblems (gestures that substitute for words, such as waving the hand for 'goodbye' or putting a forefinger to the lips for 'silence'); illustrators (gestures that accompany speech and depict what is being said, such as moving the hands apart to illustrate a description of a big fish); adaptors (gestures, usually involving self-touching, that help one to cope with emotional reactions, such as covering the eyes with shock or putting a hand over the mouth with surprise); and regulators (gestures that accompany speech and help to coordinate turn-taking, including raising a hand in the air to indicate that one has not finished speaking). In addition to these, affect displays are facial expressions that convey emotional states. Also called body language.
