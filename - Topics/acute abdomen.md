- the sudden uncontrolled development of severe abdominal symptoms secondary to disease or injury. Failure to establish a prompt diagnosis may lead to rapid clinical decline. Perforation of a peptic ulcer, an inflamed appendix or colonic diverticulum, or rupture of the liver or spleen following a crush injury all produce an acute abdomen requiring urgent treatment.
