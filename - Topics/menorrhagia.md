- $n$. abnormally heavy bleeding at menstruation, which may or may not be associated with abnormally long periods. Menorrhagia may be associated with pelvic inflammatory disease, tumours (especially fibroids) in the pelvic cavity, endometriosis, or the presence of an IUCD. In some cases no obvious pathology can be demonstrated; heavy, prolonged, or frequent uterine bleeding not associated with pelvic or systemic disease is known as dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Medical treatment for menorrhagia includes NSAIDs, antifibrinolytic drugs, and hormonal therapy, such as progestogen-only pills, gonadorelin analogues, or the IUS (Mirena). Surgical treatments include endometrial ablation and hysterectomy. In some extreme cases a blood transfusion may be necessary.
