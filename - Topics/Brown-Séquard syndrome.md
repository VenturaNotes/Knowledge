- the neurological condition resulting when the spinal cord has been damaged. In those parts of the body supplied by the damaged segment there is a flaccid weakness and loss of feeling in the skin. Below the lesion there is a spastic paralysis on the same side and a loss of pain and temperature sensation on the opposite side. The causes include trauma and multiple sclerosis. \[C. E.
