- In number theory, an algebraic equation in one or more unknowns, with integer coefficients, for which integer solutions are sought. As examples: 
	- (i) $14x + 9y = 1$ has solutions $x = 2+9t$, $y = -3-14t$, where $t$ is any integer
	- (ii) $x^2+1=2y^4$ has two solutions $x=1, y=1$ and $x = 239, y=13$
	- (iii) $x^3+y^3=z^3$ has only trivial solutions
