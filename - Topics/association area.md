- an area of cerebral cortex that lies away from the main areas that are concerned with the reception of sensory impulses and the start of motor impulses but is linked to them by many neurons known as association fibres. The areas of association are thought to be responsible for the elaboration of the information received by the primary sensory areas and its correlation with the information fed in from memory and from other brain areas. They are thus responsible for the maintenance of many higher mental activities. See also BODY IMAGE.

- $n$. Another name for a tertiary projection area, or more loosely any area of the cerebral cortex not devoted to primary sensory or motor functions, or to primary and secondary sensory or motor functions (usage is not consistent). Also called an association centre or an area of the association cortex.
