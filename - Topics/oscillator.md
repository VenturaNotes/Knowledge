- An electronic circuit that switches back and forth between states. Oscillators are mainly used to provide clock signals or a frequency reference, in which applications they are normally crystal controlled. A specialized form is the VCO (voltage controlled oscillator) in which the frequency may be modified within limits by a control voltage, the free-running frequency being determined by external components.
