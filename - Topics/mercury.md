- $n$. a silvery metallic element that is liquid at room temperature. Its toxicity caused a decline in the use of its compounds in medicine during the 20th century; mercurial compounds were formerly used in the treatment of syphilis and as purgatives, teething pastes and powders, fungicides, and antiparasitic agents. Mercury is still widely used in dentistry as a component of amalgam fillings; when the mercury is combined with the filling alloy, it is nontoxic. Symbol: Hg. See also MERCURIALISM; PINK DISEASE.
