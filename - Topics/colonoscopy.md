- $n$. an invasive endoscopic procedure for examining the interior of the colon and the terminal ileum. A colonoscope is a flexible, steerable telescopic instrument that houses a high-definition digital video camera to allow direct visualization of the colonic mucosa. It is inserted into the anus and guided around the loops of the large bowel to the caecum and terminal ileum. Its progress may be aided by using an external 3-D magnetic imager (e.g. ScopeGuide). It is possible to obtain biopsies for microscopic examination using flexible forceps passed through the colonoscope (diagnostic colonoscopy) and to remove polyps, dilate strictures with endoscopic balloons, or insert self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) into benign or malignant strictures (therapeutic colonoscopy).
