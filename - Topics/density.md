## Synthesis
- The density formula is: $\rho = \frac MV$ 
	- $\rho$ = density
	- M = Mass
	- V = Volume
## Source [^1]
- The average density of a body is the ratio of its mass to its volume. In general, the density of a body may not be constant throughout the body. The density at a point P, denoted by $\rho(P)$, is equal to the limit as $\Delta V \to 0$ of $\Delta m / \Delta V$, where $\Delta V$ is the volume of a small region containing P and $\Delta m$ is the mass of the part of the body occupying that small region.
- Consider a rod of length $l$, with density $\rho (x)$ at the point a distance x from one end of the rod. Then the mass $m$ of the rod is given by $$m = \int_0^l\rho(x)dx$$
## Source[^2]
- (1) A measure of the amount of information in a given dimension of a storage medium. The density of information on a disk is almost always a fixed number of bits per sector, sectors per track, and tracks per disk. For magnetic tape it is the amount of information recorded per unit length of tape, usually in bits per inch or bits per millimeter. In general the number of flux reversals per inch (or per mm ) is different because of redundancy in the coding. The density is stated for a single track. A tape transport can often read tapes with different densities under program control.
