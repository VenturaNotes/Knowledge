- The average density of a body is the ratio of its mass to its volume. In general, the density of a body may not be constant throughout the body. The density at a point P, denoted by $\rho(P)$, is equal to the limit as $\Delta V \to 0$ of $\Delta m / \Delta V$, where $\Delta V$ is the volume of a small region containing P and $\Delta m$ is the mass of the part of the body occupying that small region.
- Consider a rod of length $l$, with density $\rho (x)$ at the point a distance x from one end of the rod. Then the mass $m$ of the rod is given by $$m = \int_0^l\rho(x)dx$$
