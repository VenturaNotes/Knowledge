- $n$. A personality disorder in DSM-5 characterized by a pervasive pattern of preoccupation with orderliness, perfectionism, and control, at the cost of flexibility, openness, and efficiency, beginning by early adulthood and indicated by such signs and symptoms as excessive preoccupation with details, rules, and order; perfectionism that interferes with task completion; excessive devotion to work at the expense of leisure; excessive conscientiousness and scrupulousness; tendency to hoard worthless objects; reluctance to delegate tasks to others; thrifty or stingy attitude towards money; rigidity and stubbornness. The absence of true obsessions or compulsions makes this condition easily distinguishable from obsessive-compulsive disorder, despite the similarity of their names, and also suggests that obsessive-compulsive personality disorder is a misnomer. Also called anankastic personality disorder. See also anal CHARACTER, ANAL TRIAD.
