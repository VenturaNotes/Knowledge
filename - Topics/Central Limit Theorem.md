- A fundamental theorem of statistics connects the distribution of a growing sample from a given distribution with the normal distribution. Formally, let $X_1, X_2, X_3,...$be a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables with mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2$, and let $$\overline X_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}, Z_n = \frac{(\overline{X}_n-\mu)}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}.$$Then, as $n$ increases, the distribution of $Z_n$ converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.
- It implies that for a large sample, the sample mean has approximately the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2/n$

- $n$. In statistics, a theorem showing (roughly) that the sum of any sufficiently large number of unrelated variables tends to be distributed according to the normal distribution, irrespective of how the individual variables are distributed, except in certain special cases. It explains why psychological and biological variables that are due to the additive effects of numerous independently acting causes are often distributed approximately normally. The earliest version of it was proved in 1818 by the French mathematician Pierre Simon Marquis de Laplace (1749-1827).
