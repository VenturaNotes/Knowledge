- A fundamental theorem of statistics connects the distribution of a growing sample from a given distribution with the normal distribution. Formally, let $X_1, X_2, X_3,...$be a sequence of independent, identically distributed random variables with mean $\mu$ and finite variance $\sigma^2$, and let $$\overline X_n = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}, Z_n = \frac{(\overline{X}_n-\mu)}{\sigma/\sqrt{n}}.$$Then, as $n$ increases, the distribution of $Z_n$ converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1.
- It implies that for a large sample, the sample mean has approximately the normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^2/n$
