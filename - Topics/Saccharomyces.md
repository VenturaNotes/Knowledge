- An industrially important genus of yeasts. S. cerevisiae, of which there are at least 1000 strains, is used in baking (see BAKER's YEAST), brewing, and wine making; it is also used in the production of various proteins and other compounds in biotechnology, including industrial alcohol, and as a model organism for experimental studies in cell biology and genetics. Other yeasts used in the production of beer include S. uvarum (or carlsbergensis); it is distinguished from S. cerevisiae by its ability to ferment the disaccharide melibose using $\alpha$-galactosidase, an enzyme not produced by $S$. cerevisiae. $S$. boulardii is used as a probiotic dietary supplement for the prevention and treatment of diarrhoeal diseases.
