- Wages that adjust instantaneously in response to a change in economic environment to balance supply and demand for labor. In some economic theories it is assumed that real wages are flexible but nominal wages are fixed in the short run (by wage contracts, unionized bargaining, etc.). This assumption of nominal rigidity in the labor market is used in such theories to explain involuntary unemployment.
