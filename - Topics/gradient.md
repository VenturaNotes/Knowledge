- The vector obtained by applying the differential operator del, $$\nabla = \textbf i \frac {\partial}{\partial x} + \textbf j \frac{\partial}{\partial y} + \textbf k \frac{\partial}{\partial z},$$to a scalar function of position $\phi(r)$. This gives the gradient of $\phi$ as grad$$\phi=\nabla\phi = \textbf i \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} + \textbf j \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} + \textbf k \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial z}$$The gradient of $\phi$ points in the direction in which $\phi$ is increasing fastest.
