- Control over wage rates, as part of a prices and incomes policy. As there are many different wage rates, no control body could actually determine them all from first principles: pay control has usually been content with limiting increases, either to some percentage or some flat-rate increase. A pay freeze is a particularly drastic form of pay control where the target rate of increase is set at zero.
