- A technique used to prevent web crawler bots from signing on to web services intended for human users. It typically consists of an image that features distorted text easily recognized by humans, but too difficult for current image or text recognition software to handle. The user enters the recognized text into a dialogue box to prove that the entity interacting with the system is in fact human. See also Turing TEST.
