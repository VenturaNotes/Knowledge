- The real function $f$ of one variable is differentiable at $a$ if $\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}$ has a limit as $h \to 0$; that is, if the derivative of $f$ at $a$ exists. Informally a function is differentiable if it is possible to define the gradient of the graph $y = f(x)$ and hence define a tangent at the point. The function $f$ is differentiable in an open interval if it is differentiable at every point in the interval; and $f$ is differentiable on the closed interval $[a, b],$ where $a < b$, if it is differentiable in $(a,b)$ and if the right derivative of $f$ at $a$ and the left derivative of $f$ at $b$ exist.
