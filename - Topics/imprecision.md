- Humans have expert abilities to reason with vague information; they seem to use approximations, abstractions, and qualitative data very effectively, in place of precise numeric information. This has been explored in artificial intelligence with reasoning systems that employ approximate models and vague values. In order to implement these ideas, techniques such as fuzzy logic and qualitative reasoning have been developed.
