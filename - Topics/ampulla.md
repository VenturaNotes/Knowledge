- $n$. (pl. ampullae) an enlarged or dilated ending of a tube or canal. The semicircular canals of the inner ear are expanded into ampullae at the point where they join the vestibule. The ampulla of Vater is the dilated part of the common bile duct where it is joined by the pancreatic duct.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A small vessel such as a miniature two-handled ancient Roman flask; also any membranous vesicle, especially the bulge in each semicircular canal with its crest-shaped inner surface or crista containing hair cells. It is part of the vestibular system and plays a part in sensations of body orientation. \[From Latin ampulla a small flagon, irregular diminutive of amphora a flagon]
## Source[^3]
- (pl. ampullae) 
- (1) An enlargement at one end of each of the semicircular canals of the inner ear. Each ampulla contains a group of receptors$\textendash$sensory hair cells$\textendash$embedded in a gelatinous cap (cupula), which detects movement in one particular dimension, corresponding to the plane of the canal. Movement of the head causes the cupula (and the hairs within it) to bend in a direction opposite to that of the head movement (see illustration); this stimulates nerve impulses in the receptors, which are interpreted by the brain as movement in a particular dimension. 
- (2) Any small vesicle or saclike process. 
- (3) (ampulla of Lorenzini) See ELECTRORECEPTOR.
