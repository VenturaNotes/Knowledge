- $n$. In analytical psychology, a term introduced by Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) in the Tavistock lectures, delivered in London in 1935, to denote a process of allowing fantasies (2) to run free, as if dreaming with open eyes. He had expounded the concept (though not the terminology) earlier (Collected Works, 6, paragraphs 712-14, 723n). See also ABAISSEMENT DU NIVEAU MENTAL.
