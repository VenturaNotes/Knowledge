- (exodermis) The outermost layer of cells in the plant cortex, lying immediately below the epidermis. These cells are sometimes modified to give additional structural support or to store food materials or water. After the loss of the piliferous layer of the root the hypodermis takes over the protective functions of the epidermis.
