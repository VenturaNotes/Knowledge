- (contrast agent) a substance administered to enhance the visibility of structures (i.e. increase the contrast) during imaging. In radiography a positive contrast agent (e.g. barium sulphate or a water-soluble iodine-containing compound) increases the density of a structure. Gas is a negative contrast agent. Positive and negative contrast media can be used together (e.g. barium sulphate and gas in a double-contrast barium enema). Magnetic resonance (MR) contrast agents contain either a positive contrast atom (usually gadolinium) to increase the signal or a negative contrast atom (such as iron) to decrease it. Ultrasound contrast medium consists of tiny ( $1-10 ~\mu \mathrm{m}$ diameter) bubbles of gas, which reflect back the sound waves strongly. They can also be made to resonate or rupture to increase the signal to the ultrasound probe.
