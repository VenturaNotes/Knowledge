- $n$. Simultaneous presentation of a different tactile stimulus (such as letter shapes or novel shapes without names) to each of the two hands, shielded from vision, in order to study laterality of functions, based on the fact that the touch receptors in each hand are projected predominantly to the opposite or contralateral somatosensory cortex, the results generally confirming a left hemisphere dominance for linguistic or sequential functions and a right hemisphere dominance for spatial functions. Also spelt dichaptic . Compare DICHoptic, DICHotic. \[From Greek dicha in two, from dis twice + haptein to touch]
