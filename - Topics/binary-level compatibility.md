- Compatibility that exists when a program in executable binary form may be executed on different computer systems without recompilation. This will normally only be possible between systems with the same operating system and with processors or emulations of processors capable of executing the same instruction set. See also ABI, SOURCE-LEVEL COMPATIBILITY.
