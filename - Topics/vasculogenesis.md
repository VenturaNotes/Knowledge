- $n$. the formation of new blood vessels resulting from the directed migration and differentiation of angioblasts (precursor cells) into endothelial cells. The primitive vessels undergo further growth and remodelling by angiogenesis. Although largely confined to the embryo, vasculogenesis has recently been shown to occur in adults from circulating angioblasts.
