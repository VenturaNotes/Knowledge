- (active center) The site on the surface of an enzyme molecule that binds and acts on the substrate molecule. The properties of an active site are determined by the three-dimensional arrangement of the polypeptide chains of the enzyme and their constituent amino acids. These govern the nature of the interaction that takes place and hence the degree of substrate specificity and susceptibility to inhibition. Binding of the substrate involves the formation of weak bonds between it and the enzyme, which induces subtle changes in shape of the active site so it fits more tightly around the substrate$\textemdash$a so-called induced fit mechanism.
