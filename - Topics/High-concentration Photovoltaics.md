## Source [^1]
- High-concentration Photovoltaics (HCPV) are systems that use concentrated sunlight to generate solar power. Businesses might benefit from HCPV if they use solar panels to produce electricity. Here's the science: HCPV systems use solar optical devices made of dish reflectors and Fresnel lenses. These optical devices concentrate sunlight onto photovoltaic cells found in solar panels that some business owners install on their roofs. HCPV systems can concentrate sunlight onto solar panelsÂ 100-1,000 times, making them more energy efficient than low-concentration and medium-concentration PV.
