## Source [^1]
- (deoxyribonucleic acid) the genetic material of nearly all living organisms, which controls heredity and is located in the cell nucleus (see CHROMOSOME; GENE). DNA is a nucleic acid composed of two strands made up of units called nucleotides (see illustration). The two strands are wound around each other into a double helix and linked together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of the nucleotides (see BASE PAIRING). The genetic information of the DNA is contained in the sequence of bases along the molecule (see GENETIC CODE); changes in the DNA cause mutations. The DNA molecule can make exact copies of itself by the process of replication, thereby passing on the genetic information to the daughter cells when the cell divides.

## Source[^2]
- (deoxyribonucleic acid) The genetic material of most living organisms, which is a major constituent of the chromosomes within the cell nucleus and plays a central role in the determination of hereditary characteristics by controlling protein synthesis in cells (see also GENETIC CODE). It is also found in chloroplasts and mitochondria (see EXTRANUCLEAR GENES; MITOCHONDRIAL DNA). DNA is a nucleic acid composed of two chains of nucleotides in which the sugar is deoxyribose and the bases are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and thymine (compare RNA). The carbon atoms of each deoxyribose unit are numbered 1' (i.e. 1 'prime') to 5'. Attached to each 5' carbon atom is a phosphate group, via which a covalent bond forms with the 3 ' carbon of the ribose of the adjoining nucleotide. The chains run in opposite directions$\textemdash$they are antiparallelâ€”with 3' and 5' chain ends apposed at either end of the molecule. The two chains are wound round each other and linked together by hydrogen bonds between specific complementary bases (see BASE PAIRING) to form a spiral ladder-shaped molecule (double helix; see also SUPERCOILING). Van der Waals forces between adjacent bases on the same strand also contribute to chain stability. See illustration.
- When the cell divides, its DNA also replicates in such a way that each of the two daughter molecules is identical to the parent molecule (see DNA REPLICATION). Synthesis of DNA from scratch is a key technology of synthetic biology and particularly crucial to fulfilling the potential of DNA as a medium for storing digital data. See also COMPLEMENTARY DNA.

## Source[^3]
- abbrev. Deoxyribonucleic acid (also written desoxyribonucleic acid), a self-replicating molecule that is the major functional constituent of chromosomes and is also found inside mitochondria in the cytoplasm of cells, containing the genes transmitted from parents to offspring in most organisms, and consisting of two strands of complementary chemical base (1) pairs (adenine paired with thymine and cytosine with guanine) incorporating the genetic information, the strands being linked to a backbone composed of the sugar deoxyribose alternating with a phosphate and coiled into a double helix (spiral) (see illustration). Human DNA contains approximately 21,000 to 23,000 genes, each gene consisting of a sequence of base pairs encoding a corresponding sequence of amino acids that constitute a specific protein.
