- (deoxyribonucleic acid) the genetic material of nearly all living organisms, which controls heredity and is located in the cell nucleus (see CHROMOSOME; GENE). DNA is a nucleic acid composed of two strands made up of units called nucleotides (see illustration). The two strands are wound around each other into a double helix and linked together by hydrogen bonds between the bases of the nucleotides (see BASE PAIRING). The genetic information of the DNA is contained in the sequence of bases along the molecule (see GENETIC CODE); changes in the DNA cause mutations. The DNA molecule can make exact copies of itself by the process of replication, thereby passing on the genetic information to the daughter cells when the cell divides.
