- $n$. a small particle found in the cytoplasm of cells, near the nucleus. Centrioles are involved in the formation of the spindle and aster during cell division. During interphase there are usually two centrioles in the centrosome; when cell division occurs these separate and move to opposite sides of the nucleus, and the spindle is formed between them.
