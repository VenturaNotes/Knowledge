- $n$. In analytical psychology, a term introduced in 1912 by Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) to denote a form of projective identification in which a person gains influence over another. Jung borrowed the term from the French anthropologist Lucien Lévy-Bruhl (1857-1939) who used it to denote a phenomenon whereby people identify themselves with a physical object such as a holy artefact or a totem. \[French: literally mystical involvement]
