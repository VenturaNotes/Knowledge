- a condition in which segments of the gastrointestinal tract become inflamed, thickened, ulcerated, and scarred. It can affect any part of the tract from mouth to anus; common areas affected are the small bowel and colon. It commonly affects the terminal ileum and may mimic acute appendicitis. The main symptoms are abdominal pain, diarrhoea, tiredness, and loss of weight. Longstanding poorly controlled Crohn's disease may predispose to malabsorption, strictures, and intestinal obstruction. Fistulae around the anus, between adjacent loops of intestine, or from intestine to skin, bladder, etc., may complicate Crohn's disease. The cause is unknown, but various environmental and genetic factors are thought to be involved. Treatment includes aminosalicylates, corticosteroids, immunosuppressant drugs, monoclonal antibodies, antibiotics, dietary modification, or (in many cases) surgical correction or removal of the affected part of the intestine. \[B. B. Crohn (1884-1983), US physician]
