- A charter of a ship or of cargo space for a fixed number of voyages rather than for a fixed period (compare TIME CHARTER). The shipowner usually warrants that the ship will arrive at an agreed port on an agreed day, will be in seaworthy condition, and will be properly equipped. The charterer agrees to load and unload in the agreed number of lay days.
