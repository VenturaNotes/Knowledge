- The rate of return that a company's shareholders expect for holding stock in that company, used as part of the calculation of the total cost of capital for a firm. It represents the opportunity cost to investors of holding shares. The cost can be calculated by a formula dividing dividends per share by current market value, and adding the dividend growth rate.
