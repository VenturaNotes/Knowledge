- An electronic logic gate whose output is logic 0 (false) only when all (two or more) inputs are logic 1 (true), otherwise it is logic 1 . It thus implements the logical NAND operation and has the same truth table. The diagram shows the usual circuit symbol of a two-input gate (which implies by the small circle that it is equivalent to an AND gate whose output has been inverted) and the associated truth table.
