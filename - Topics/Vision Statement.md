- A vision statement is a description of why an organization exists and how it plans to achieve its long-term goals. In other words, a vision statement assigns purpose to a company and motivates teams to work together to achieve set business goals. Vision statements are often quite brief and focus on one clear objective for a business to achieve in the future. Vision statements focus on the big picture of an organization, enabling internal departments to set individual priorities and goals that benefit the entire organization.
