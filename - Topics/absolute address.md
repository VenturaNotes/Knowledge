- A unique number that specifies a unique location within the address space where an operand is to be found/deposited, or where an instruction is located. It generally specifies a memory location but in some cases specifies a machine register or an I/O device. In the case of a binary machine, it is an $n$-bit number specifying one of $2^{n}$ locations. The result of calculating an effective address is usually an absolute address.
