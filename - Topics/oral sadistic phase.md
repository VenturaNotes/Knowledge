- $n$. The second of the two phases of the oral stage, corresponding to the teething period, according to a subdivision suggested in 1924 by the German psychoanalyst Karl Abraham (1877-1925) in his book Versuch einer Entwicklungsgeschichte der Libido (A Study of the Developmental History of the Libido). It is characterized by biting, in contrast to the early oral phase, which is characterized by sucking. In a chapter in a co-authored book Developments in Psycho-Analysis in 1952, the British-based Austrian psychoanalyst Melanie Klein (1882-1960) rejected Abraham's distinction between the early sucking and later biting phases of the oral stage, and she declared the oral stage to be sadistic from the start: 'aggression forms part of the infant's earliest relation to the breast, though it is not usually expressed in biting at \[the early] stage'. Also called the oral sadistic stage or the cannibalistic stage. See also ORAL-AGGESESSIVE CHARACTER.
