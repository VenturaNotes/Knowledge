- (1) (of a set $S$ on which the partial ordering < is defined) An element $l$ with the property that $l<s$ for all $s$ in $S$. Also $l$ is a greatest lower bound if, for any other lower bound $h, h<l$.
- Since numerical computing demands the truncation of infinite arithmetic to finite arithmetic, the computation of greatest lower bounds of real numbers, indeed of any limit, can only be achieved to a machine tolerance, usually defined to be machine precision: the smallest epsilon eps, such that$$1.0+\text { eps }>1.0$$in computer arithmetic. See also UPPER BOUND. 
- (2) (of a matrix or vector) See ARRAY.
