- Global delivery refers to delivering IT services from anywhere in the world. This means that an information technology professional will work from a remote location. They will provide IT assistance while doing so. This has added challenges for IT professionals. They must not only possess all necessary skills, but also the ability to communicate these skills from a remote location.
