## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- comparison of a group of people with a disease or condition and a control group of people free from that disease (e.g. people diagnosed with lung cancer and people without lung cancer). The groups are compared in terms of the frequency of variables in their backgrounds (e.g. cigarette smoking). This method can be used to investigate risk factors for diseases. In the more precise matched pair study each individual with the disease is paired with a control matched on the basis of (say) age, sex, and occupation: this places greater emphasis on the factors for which the pairs have not been matched. Compare CROSS-SECTIONAL STUDY, LONGITUDINAL STUDY.
