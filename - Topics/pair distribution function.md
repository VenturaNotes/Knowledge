- A function that gives the probability of finding the centre of a particle at a distance r from the centre of another particle. This function is used extensively in the theory of liquids and disordered solids. In the case of hard spheres, the function is zero until twice the radius of the sphere, then has a maximum value at this point. After this it consists of peaks and troughs that get smaller with increasing r.
