- $n$. 
- (1) either of the two lower chambers of the heart, which have thick muscular walls. The left ventricle, which is thicker than the right, receives blood from the pulmonary vein via the left atrium and pumps it into the aorta. The right ventricle pumps blood received from the venae cavae (via the right atrium) into the pulmonary artery. 
- (2) one of the four fluid-filled cavities within the brain (see illustration). The paired first and second ventricles (lateral ventricles), one in each cerebral hemisphere, communicate with the third ventricle in the midline between them. This in turn leads through a narrow channel, the cerebral aqueduct, to the fourth ventricle in the hindbrain, which is continuous with the spinal canal in the centre of the spinal cord. Cerebrospinal fluid circulates through all the cavities. $\textemdash$ventricular adj.

## Source[^2]
- (1) A chamber of the heart that receives blood from an atrium and pumps it into the arterial system. Amphibians and fish have a single ventricle, but mammals, birds, and reptiles have two, pumping deoxygenated blood to the lungs and oxygenated blood to the rest of the body, respectively. 
- (2) Any of the four linked fluid-filled cavities in the brain of vertebrates. One of these cavities is in the medulla oblongata, two are in the cerebral hemispheres (see CEREBRUM), and the fourth is in the posterior part of the forebrain. The ventricles contain cerebrospinal fluid filtered from the blood by the choroid plexus.
