- $n$. Another name for an obsessive-compulsive disorder. The term was introduced in German (Zwangsneurose) by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) in an article on 'Heredity and the Aetiology of the Neuroses' (1896): 'I was obliged to begin my work with a nosolographic innovation. I found reason to set alongside of hysteria the obsessional neurosis as a self-sufficient and independent disorder' (Standard Edition, III, pp. 143-56, at p. 146). See also TRANSFERENCE NEUROSIS.
