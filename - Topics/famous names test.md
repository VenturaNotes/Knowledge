- $n$. A technique for measuring long-term memory and providing evidence for amnesia. Respondents are presented with the names of people who were famous for limited periods up to several decades previously and are asked to try to identify them and recall what they were famous for. The names that are chosen are usually of people such as Winston Churchill, John F. Kennedy, and Elvis Presley, who were so famous that respondents with intact memories are expected to remember all of them.
