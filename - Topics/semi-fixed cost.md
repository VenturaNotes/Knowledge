- (stepped cost) An item of expenditure that increases in total as activity rises but in a stepped, rather than a linear, function (see LINEAR COST FUNCTION). For example, the costs of one supervisor may be required for a particular range of activity, although above this level the cost of an additional supervisor would be incurred.
