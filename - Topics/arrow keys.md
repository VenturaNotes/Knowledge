- (direction keys) Four keys on a computer keyboard with arrows engraved on the keycaps pointing up, down, left, and right. They can be separate keys, usually found to the right of the typewriter keys, or combined with other keys. A 102-key PC keyboard has separate arrow keys as well as arrow keys on the numeric keypad. A laptop keyboard will often have the arrow keys combined with the typewriter keys and activated by a special shift key. The action performed by arrow keys is under program control, but usually involves moving the cursor or some part of the display in the indicated direction.
