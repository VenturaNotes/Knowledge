- (centigrade temperature) temperature expressed on a scale in which the melting point of ice is assigned a temperature of $0^{\circ}$ and the boiling point of water a temperature of $100^{\circ}$. For many medical purposes this scale has superseded the Fahrenheit scale (see FAHRENHEIT TEMPERATURE). The formula for converting from Celsius (C) to Fahrenheit (F) is: $\mathrm{F}=9 / 5 \mathrm{C}+32$. \[A. Celsius (1701-44), Swedish astronomer]
