- An expression of the form$$e_{1} \& \ldots \& e_{n} \rightarrow e$$which means that if the equations $e_{1}, \ldots, e_{n}$ hold then the equation $e$ holds. Conditional equations have many properties in common with equations; in particular, sets of conditional equations possess initial algebras and generalizations of Birkhoff's completeness theorem.
