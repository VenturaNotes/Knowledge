- A basis used in absorption costing for absorbing the manufacturing overhead into the cost units produced. The formula is:$$\begin{align}\text{budgeted manufacturing overhead /} &\\ \text{budgeted machine hours.}\end{align}$$
- This rate may not be very useful for managers if overheads do not increase or decrease as machine hours increase or decrease. Activity-based costing systems can provide a more accurate cause-and-effect allocation of costs.
