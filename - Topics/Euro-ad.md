- An advertisement designed to be used in all countries of the European Union. Certain products, particularly those that have been in use for long enough for national traditions to build up, are not suitable for multinational advertisements. Food is an example: there would be no point in advertising tinned baked beans in France. On the other hand, advertisements for cars, a more recent product, can have an equal appeal in all European countries.
