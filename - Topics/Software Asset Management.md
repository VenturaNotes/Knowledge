- Software asset management (SAM) is the process of managing and optimizing software assets in an organization. SAM includes aspects such as software identification, maintenance, update, and license compliance. Software assets are valuable for businesses, but they are also vulnerable to thefts or misuse if not correctly managed. Software tools also tend to become outdated quickly, so it's essential to track which versions a business uses and whether the vendor still supports the existing versions.
