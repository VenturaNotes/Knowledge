- $n$. In DSM-5, a trauma- and stressor-related disorder following exposure to a traumatic event, with a similar pattern of symptoms to post-traumatic stress disorder, including dissociation (such as dissociative amnesia, depersonalization, derealization), but occurring within four weeks of the traumatic event. If the symptoms persist beyond four weeks, then a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder may be considered. To meet the diagnostic criteria of DSM-5, the traumatic event must be persistently re-experienced either in recurrent images, thoughts, dreams, illusions, flashback episodes, or sensations of reliving the experience; or as distress when reminded of the event. There must also be evidence of marked avoidance of reminders of the trauma, and the disturbance must have persisted for at least two days. See also trauma- and STRESSOR-RELATED DISORDERS. ASD abbrev. \[From Latin acutus sharpened, from acuere to sharpen, from acus a needle]
