- Integration-as-a-Service (IaaS) is a system that connects on-site data to data in the cloud. Information is shared between an organizationâ€™s systems and third-party vendors. IaaS is used for data storage, website hosting, application development, and data analytics. Vendors usually provide the servers, software, and other tools needed to manage cloud-based applications.
