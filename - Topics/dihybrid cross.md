- A genetic cross between parents that differ in two characteristics, controlled by genes at different loci. Mendel performed a dihybrid cross using pea plants and the characteristics of seed color and texture: the parental plants had either smooth yellow seeds (SSYY)—the dominant characteristics$\textemdash$or wrinkled green seeds (ssyy)—the recessive characteristics. All the offspring had smooth yellow seeds, being heterozygous (SsYy) for the two alleles. Crossing between these offspring produced an $\mathrm{F}_{2}$ generation of plants with smooth yellow, smooth green, wrinkled yellow, and wrinkled green seeds in the ratio 9:3:3:1 (see illustration). Mendel used these results as the basis for his Law of Independent Assortment (see MENDEL'S LAWS). Compare MONOHYBRID CROSS.
