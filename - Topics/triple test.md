- (1) (in prenatal screening) a blood test that can be performed between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy but has largely been replaced by combined first-trimester PAPP-A screening and nuchal translucency scanning. Levels of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), unconjugated oestriol $\left(\mathrm{uE}_{3}\right)$, and human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in the serum are computed with maternal age to determine the statistical likelihood of the fetus being affected by Down's syndrome or spina bifida. The double test is similar but omits measurement of $\mathrm{uE}_{3}$.
