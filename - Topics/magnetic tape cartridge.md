- (tape cartridge) A casing containing one or more reels carrying a length of magnetic tape, so arranged that it can be loaded on a suitable tape transport for access without the tape being handled by the operator. There are many forms of tape cartridge, some containing both the file reel on which the tape is wound and the take-up reel, and some the file reel only. The term is also used to describe a file reel without a separate casing but with some other provision, such as a special leader to protect the tape and avoid the need for the operator to touch it.
