- A satellite dish is a type of parabolic microwave antenna that transmits and receives satellite signals. The dish collects video or data signals from satellites in orbit and directs them to a feed horn, located on a dish system between the antenna reflector and transceiver. The feed horn then passes signals to a satellite receiver or integrated receiver/decoder (IRD). The term satellite dish comes from the dish-shaped reflector on the system.
