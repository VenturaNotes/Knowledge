- an inflammatory condition of the arteries, especially in the legs, that predominantly affects young male cigarette smokers. Intermittent claudication (pain due to reduced blood supply) and gangrene of the limbs may develop. Coronary thrombosis may occur and venous thrombosis is common. The treatment is similar to that of atheroma but cessation of smoking is essential to prevent progression of the disease. Medical name: thromboangiitis obliterans. \[L. Buerger (1879-1943), US physician]
