- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a type of instinct that is concerned with relations to an external object, distinguished by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) in his early (1910-15) classification from an ego instinct, which is a self-preservation instinct. Freud introduced the concept (though not yet the term) in 1910 in an article on 'The Psycho-Analytic View of Psychogenic Disturbance of Vision' (Standard Edition, XI, pp. 211-18, at pp. 214-15). After 1920, he recognized two varieties of object instincts, namely libidinal instincts, driven by Eros (the life instincts), and destructive instincts, driven by Thanatos (the death instinct).
