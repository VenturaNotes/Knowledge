- A real or complex number that is the root of a non-zero polynomial equation with integer coefficients. All rational numbers are algebraic, since $a/b$ is the root of the equation $bx-a = 0$. Some irrational numbers are algebraic; for example, $\sqrt{2}$ is the root of the equation $x^2-2=0$. An irrational number that is not algebraic (such as $\pi$) is called a transcendental number. The algebraic numbers are a denumerable subfield of $\mathbb{C}$. See minimal polynomial.
