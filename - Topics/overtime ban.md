- A form of industrial action in which employees refuse to work overtime, thus causing considerable dislocation to normal working but clearly less than would occur in a total strike. Overtime bans are usually supported and often organized by unions. See also WORK-TO-RULE.
## Source[^2]
- A refusal by employees to work for more than normal working hours. This is used in industrial disputes to inconvenience employers, and to press them to increase the numbers employed, in particular to avoid redundancies. While an overtime ban reduces workers' pay, it causes a much less severe drop in their incomes than a strike.
