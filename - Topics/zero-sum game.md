- A game in which the sum of the pay-offs to players is zero for every outcome. In a two-player zero-sum game a positive pay-off for one player implies a negative pay-off (of equal absolute value) for the other player. Zero-sum games represent direct opposition between the interests of the players and are used to model conflict. See also MAXIMIN.
