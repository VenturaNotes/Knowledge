- (NIF; note purchase facility) A means of enabling short-term borrowers in the eurocurrency markets to issue euronotes, with maturities of less than one year, when the need arises rather than having to arrange a separate issue of euronotes each time they need to borrow. A revolving underwriting facility (RUF) achieves the same objective.
