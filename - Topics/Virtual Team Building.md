- Virtual team building allows teams that work remotely or at a variety of locations to bond by joining in on virtual activities. These activities usually focus on building trust, promoting innovation and creativity, or simply getting to know one another better. They may also help a team focus on the business mission, and clarify and align work and projects with business goals. Businesses use tools such as Zoom, Skype, and Google Hangouts to create virtual spaces for team-building activities.
