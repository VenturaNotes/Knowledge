- (L-dopa) $n$. a naturally occurring amino acid (see DOPA) used in the treatment of parkinsonism. It is combined with benserazide in cobeneldopa or with carbidopa in co-careldopa. These drugs prevent the breakdown of levodopa to dopamine outside the brain, which reduces the severity of side-effects and enables lower doses of levodopa to be given. Side-effects may include nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, faintness on standing up, and involuntary facial movements.
