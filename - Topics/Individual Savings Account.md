- (ISA) A savings portfolio for small investors introduced in the UK in 1999, replacing personal equity plans (PEPs) and Tax Exempt Special Savings Accounts (TESSAs). Under current rules ISAs entitle individuals to save up to $£ 15,240$ per year free of tax in the form of cash, stocks and shares, or any combination of the two. The former restriction on the amount that could be saved in cash was abolished from July 2014. ISAs can be cashed in at any time without loss of the tax relief, which includes exemption from personal income tax and capital gains tax. In 2011 the government introduced Junior ISAs, which currently entitle individuals born on or after 3 January 2011 to invest up to $£ 4,080$ per year; money cannot normally be withdrawn until the holder is 18. Help to Buy ISAs, which were introduced in 2015, are for those saving for the deposit on a house; for each $£ 200$ saved, the government will add an extra $£ 50$ (to a maximum of $£ 3,000$ added). See also ISA MORTGAGE.
