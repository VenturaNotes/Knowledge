- $n$. the shaky movements and unsteady gait that result from the brain's failure to regulate the body's posture and the strength and direction of limb movements. In cerebellar ataxia, due to disease of the cerebellum, there is clumsiness of willed movements. The patient staggers when walking; he or she cannot pronounce words properly and may have nystagmus. The common causes are alcohol, drugs (e.g. phenytoin), multiple sclerosis, hereditary degenerative conditions, and paraneoplastic syndromes. Friedreich's ataxia is an inherited disorder appearing first in adolescence. It has the features of cerebellar ataxia, together with spasticity of the limbs. The unsteady movements of sensory ataxia, caused by disease of the sensory nerves, are exaggerated when the patient closes his eyes (see Romberg's SIGN). See also ATAXIA TELANGIECTASIA; TABES DORSALIS. $\textemdash$ ataxic adj.
