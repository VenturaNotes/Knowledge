- $n$. An umbrella term for several variants of the idea that theories of the universe are constrained by the necessity to allow for human existence. The most widely accepted weak anthropic principle asserts that physical and cosmological constants, including the age of the universe, are fine-tuned to allow carbon-based life to evolve. For example, if the strong nuclear force were even slightly stronger than it is, then all the hydrogen would be converted to helium, hence there would be no water for life to evolve, and if it were slightly weaker, then atoms with multiple protons would not hold together, hence hydrogen would be the only element in the universe. This explains why conditions happen to be just right for the existence of intelligent life at the present time: if the constants were slightly different, then we would not be here to observe them. Stronger (and more debatable) versions of the principle have been used to support theories of creationism or intelligent design. The principle was named by the Australian theoretical physicist Brandon Carter (born 1942) in a paper entitled 'Large Number Coincidences and the Anthropic Principle in Cosmology' delivered at a symposium in 1973 and published in the proceedings in 1974, although he later claimed that a better name would have been the 'cognizability principle'. See also Goldilocks effect. \[From Greek anthropos man or the human species + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
