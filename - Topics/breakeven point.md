- The level of production, sales volume, percentage of capacity, or sales revenue at which an organization makes neither a profit nor a loss. The breakeven point may be determined either by the construction of a breakeven chart or by calculation. The formulae are: $$\begin{align} \text{breakeven point (units) =}\\\text{total fixed costs/contribuion per unit;}\\ \\ \text{breakeven point (sales) = (total fixed}  \\\text{cost} \times \text{selling price per unit)/}\\ \text{contribution per unit.}\end{align}$$
