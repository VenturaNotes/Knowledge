- (RFA) the selective destruction of abnormal conducting tissue in the heart by the targeted delivery of radiofrequency energy via a catheter under X-ray and electrocardiographic guidance. It is usually curative in patients with supraventricular re-entrant tachycardia and is the treatment of choice for this condition (see SuPRAVENTRICULAR tachycardia; Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome). It can be used for a variety of other arrhythmias with varying degrees of success. Cryoablation is an alternative approach that uses freezing to destroy the abnormal tissue.
