- In a context where the outcomes are not determined solely by the decisions an individual takes, the expected utility of a decision is the average value of the utility function weighted by the probability distribution attached to the possible outcomes of the decision.

- The expected value of utility from entering a risky prospect. Assume the risky prospect has $n$ potential outcomes. Let the probability of outcome $i$ occurring be $p_{i}$ and the pay-off if $i$ occurs be $X_{i}$. If the utility derived from pay-off $X$ is $U(X)$, then expected utility is$$

E[U]=p_{i} U\left(X_{1}\right)+\ldots+p_{n} U\left(X_{n}\right)

$$The expected utility theorem states that if a consumer satisfies a set of axioms describing rationality they should act in risky situations as if they maximize expected utility. If utility is a linear function of $X$, then $E[U]=$ $U\left[E\left(X_{i}\right)\right]$, that is, expected utility is the utility of the expected value of the pay-offs. If utility is a concave function of pay-off, that is, $d^{2} U / d X^{2}<0$, then the expected utility of a risky prospect is less than the utility of the expected pay-off, $E[U]<U\left[E\left(X_{i}\right)\right]$, so the consumer prefers a sure pay-off to a risky prospect of the same expected value.
