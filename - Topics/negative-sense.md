## Source [^1]
- (in genetics) Describing RNA or a single strand of DNA whose base sequence is complementary to that of the messenger RNA (mRNA) required for translation into protein. By convention, the anticoding strand of duplex DNA is the negative-sense strand$\textemdash$i.e. the one that undergoes transcription to mRNA. Similarly, negative-sense viral genomes must first be transcribed into a complementary mRNA to replicate inside a host cell. Compare POSITIVE-SENSE.
