- $n$. (in physiology) sluggishness or absence of activity in certain smooth muscles. In uterine inertia the muscular wall of the uterus fails to contract adequately during labor, making the process excessively long. This inertia may be present from the start of labor or it may develop because of exhaustion following strong contractions and can lead to increased risk of atonic postpartum haemorrhage. See also SHOULDER DYSTOCIA.
