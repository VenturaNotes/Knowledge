- n. X-ray examination of the gall bladder. In oral cholecystography a radiopaque contrast agent is administered by mouth, absorbed by the intestine, and excreted into bile, which is then concentrated in the gall bladder. An X-ray image (cholecystogram) may now be taken. As a technique to demonstrate the presence of gallstones, this has been replaced by ultrasound scanning. However, cholecystography is still sometimes used to look for any leakage or obstruction to drainage after surgery; in this case, the contrast medium is administered directly by catheter.
