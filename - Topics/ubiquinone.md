## Source [^1]
- $n$. a coenzyme that acts as an electron transfer agent in the mitochondria of cells (see ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN).
## Source[^2]
- (coenzyme Q) Any of a group of related quinone-derived compounds that serve as electron carriers in the electron transport chain reactions of cellular respiration. Ubiquinone molecules have side chains of different lengths in different types of organisms but function in similar ways. They are small hydrophobic molecules and the only components of the electron transport chain that are not proteins. They move freely within the inner mitochondrial membrane.
