- (ISD) An EU directive (1993) providing a regulatory framework for securities dealing. It enshrined the principle that securities firms admitted by their domestic regulator should be allowed to operate at a European level. From 2007 the ISD was superseded by the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), which greatly strengthens the single market for financial services.
