- A nucleotide sequence in a gene that codes for part or all of the gene product and is therefore expressed in mature messenger RNA, ribosomal RNA, or transfer RNA. In eukaryotes, exons are separated by noncoding sequences called introns. Both exons and introns are transcribed into pre-messenger RNA, and subsequently the intronic sequences are removed and the exons spliced together (see RNA PROCESSING).
