- $n$. a wavelike movement that progresses along some of the hollow tubes of the body. It occurs involuntarily and is characteristic of tubes that possess circular and longitudinal muscles, such as the intestines. It is induced by distension of the walls of the tube. Immediately behind the distension the circular muscle contracts. In front of the distension the circular muscle relaxes and the longitudinal muscle contracts, which pushes the contents of the tube forward. $\textendash$peristaltic adj.
## Source[^2]
- Repeated waves of smooth muscular contraction and relaxation that pass along the alimentary canal, forcing food contents along. It is brought about by contraction of the circular muscles of the gut wall in sequence. Similar muscular movements are used by burrowing worms for locomotion or to irrigate their burrows. Compare SEGMENTATION (sense 3).
