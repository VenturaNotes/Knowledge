- The first named underwriting syndicate on a Lloyd's insurance policy. When a broker seeks to cover a risk he will first try to get a large syndicate to act as lead, which encourages smaller syndicates to cover a share of the risk. The premium rate is calculated by the lead; if others wish to join in the risk they have to insure at that rate. On a collective policy the lead insurer is the first insurer on the schedule of insurers; he issues the policy, collects the premiums, and distributes the proportions to the coinsurers.

- lead${ }^{1} :n$. a soft bluish-grey metallic element that forms several poisonous compounds. Acute lead poisoning, which may follow inhalation of lead fumes or dust, causes abdominal pains, vomiting, and diarrhoea, with paralysis and convulsions and sometimes encephalitis. In chronic poisoning a characteristic bluish marking of the gums ('lead line') is seen and the peripheral nerves are affected; there is also anaemia. Treatment is with edetate. The use of lead in paints is now strictly controlled. Symbol: Pb .

- (1) a portion of an electrocardiographic record that is obtained from a single electrode or a combination of electrodes placed on a particular part of the body (see ELECTROCARDIOGRAM; ELECTROCARDIOGRAPHY). In the conventional ECG, 12 leads are recorded. Each lead represents the electrical activity of the heart as 'viewed' from a different position on the body surface and may help to localize myocardial damage. 
- (2) a flexible steerable insulated wire introduced into the heart under X-ray control to allow electrical stimulation of the heart for the purpose of pacing (see PACEMAKER).
