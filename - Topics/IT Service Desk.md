- An information technology (IT) service desk is a technical support center that helps users find solutions and answers to their IT problems and questions. This includes answering IT service requests and resolving incidents or bugs. Fully-staffed IT service desks can help with everything from data migration to software debugging. Beyond incident resolution and service requests, IT service desks may also maintain a knowledge base or self-service portal to help users resolve basic issues.
