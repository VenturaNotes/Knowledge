- a form of bariatric surgery in which a band is placed around the stomach to effectively reduce its size and therefore restrict the amount of food it can accommodate. Weight loss should result. The procedure can be performed either in open operation or laparoscopically. The bands can be of a fixed size or adjustable (to vary calorie intake) by means of a small reservoir situated under the skin into which fluid can be injected or removed by the patient.
