- A policy package intended to restrain the level of demand by restricting credit. This may include restricting the money supply, raising interest rates, restricting the level of lending by particular banks or other credit intermediaries, or restricting the type of transactions for which credit is available. For example, limits could be placed on the maximum percentage of the price of goods which could be covered by hire purchase, or the maximum percentage of house prices which could be covered by a mortgage.
