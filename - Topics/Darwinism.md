- The theory of evolution proposed by Charles Darwin in On the Origin of Species (1859), which postulated that present-day species have evolved from simpler ancestral types by the process of natural selection acting on the variability found within populations. This was a fuller account of a paper written jointly by Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace and presented to the Linnean Society in 1858. On the Origin of Species caused a furore when it was first published because it suggested that species are not immutable nor were they specially created$\textemdash$a view directly opposed to the doctrine of special creation. However, the wealth of evidence presented by Darwin gradually convinced most people and the only major unresolved problem was to explain how the variations in populations arose and were maintained from one generation to the next. This became clear with the rediscovery of Mendel's work on classical genetics in the 1900s and led to the present theory of neo-Darwinism.
