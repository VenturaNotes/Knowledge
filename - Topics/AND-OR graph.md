## Source [^1]
- A form of graph or tree used in problem solving and problem decomposition. The nodes of the graph represent states or goals and their successors are labelled as either AND or OR branches. The AND successors are subgoals that must all be achieved to satisfy the parent goal, while OR branches indicate alternative subgoals, any one of which could satisfy the parent goal.
