- (1) Denoting an asset that earns back its original cost out of income over a fixed period. 
- (2) Denoting a loan in which the money is used to finance a project that will provide sufficient yield to repay the loan and its interest and leave a profit. 
- (3) Denoting a sales-promotion offer that pays for itself. For example, if a seller of tea bags offers a free tea mug in exchange for a specified number of vouchers, each taken from a box of tea bags, the seller expects the extra number of tea-bag boxes sold during the promotion to pay for the costs of buying and despatching the mugs.
