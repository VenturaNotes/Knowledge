- Business intelligence (BI) services analyze current and past business data. The resulting information helps leadership teams learn what they've been doing right and what needs improvement. This improves overall executive decision-making, which can make businesses more competitive and profitable. BI relies on software programs, data analytics, technology applications, and technology platforms to create real solutions about a specific industry or business. In short, BI services provide strategies that companies can use to improve their operations and finances.
