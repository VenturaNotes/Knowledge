- Business intelligence (BI) services analyze current and past business data. The resulting information helps leadership teams learn what theyâ€™ve been doing right and what needs improvement. This improves overall executive decision-making, which can make businesses more competitive and profitable. BI relies on software programs, data analytics, technology applications, and technology platforms to create real solutions about a specific industry or business. In short, BI services provide strategies that companies can use to improve their operations and finances.
