## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A form of circuit packaging (integrated circuit or discrete component) where connections between the device and the mounting substrate are made purely on the surface. No drilled holes are needed to mount these components, the physical connection being achieved by re-flow soldering, normally by means of an infrared heat source. Extremely high packing densities are achievable. This, combined with automatic placement and soldering, yield very cost-effective products. See also SMD.
