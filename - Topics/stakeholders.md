## Synthesis
- Stakeholders can be part of the internal staff of a software company. They could test the software before it reaches external testers
	- #question Is this true? Are stakeholders really part of the internal staff? I thought the company works for stakeholders. Not the other way around
	- #question Do stakeholders really test software? I thought stakeholders were the end users of the product.

- All those with interests in an organization; for example, as shareholders, employees, suppliers, customers, or members of the wider community (who could be affected by environmental consequences of an organization's activities). Stakeholder theory is an approach to business that attempts to incorporate the interests of all stakeholders in a business, as opposed to the view that a firm is responsible only to its owners (see SHAREHOLDER VALUE). It thus attempts to adopt an inclusive rather than a narrow approach to business responsibility.
