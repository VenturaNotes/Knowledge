## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Application programming interface is a set of rules and definitions that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
	- #question How does API work? Is it connected to a server?
	- #question I need more details about this. I don't understand application programming interfaces
	- #question How can software applications communicate with each other through API?

## Source[^2]

### Example
- [[Google Maps API]]

### Details
- An Application Programming Interface (API) acts like a messenger between different software systems, ensuring they can talk to each other without the developer needing to understand how the other system works internally.
	- #question How is an API called for or used? Is an API a device?
- APIs come in different types:
	- [[REST APIs]] (Representational State Transfer) – Used for web applications, where clients make HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with data.
	- [[SOAP APIs]] (Simple Object Access Protocol) – Used in enterprise applications for structured communication.
	- GraphQL APIs – Allow clients to request specific data, reducing unnecessary responses.
	- Operating System APIs – Like Windows API or macOS APIs, which allow software to interact with the OS.

## Source[^3]
- An application programming interface (API) is code that enables two software programs to communicate.

## Source[^4]
- An interface that is defined in terms of a set of functions and procedures, and enables a program to gain access to facilities within an application. A typical example would be a CASE tool that provides an API to enable users to develop special programs to utilize the information within the CASE tool's internal database. The use of such facilities enables users to customize the application for their own purposes and to integrate the application into a customized development environment.
