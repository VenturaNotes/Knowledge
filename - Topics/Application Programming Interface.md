## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Application programming interface is a set of rules and definitions that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
	- #question How does API work? Is it connected to a server?
	- #question I need more details about this. I don't understand application programming interfaces
	- #question How can software applications communicate with each other through API?

## Source[^2]

### Example
- [[Google Maps API]]

### Details
- An Application Programming Interface (API) acts like a messenger between different software systems, ensuring they can talk to each other without the developer needing to understand how the other system works internally.
	- #question How is an API called for or used? Is an API a device?
- APIs come in different types:
	- [[REST APIs]] (Representational State Transfer) – Used for web applications, where clients make HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with data.
	- [[SOAP APIs]] (Simple Object Access Protocol) – Used in enterprise applications for structured communication.
	- GraphQL APIs – Allow clients to request specific data, reducing unnecessary responses.
	- Operating System APIs – Like Windows API or macOS APIs, which allow software to interact with the OS.

## Source[^3]
- An application programming interface (API) is code that enables two software programs to communicate.
