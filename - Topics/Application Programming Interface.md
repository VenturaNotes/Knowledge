## Synthesis
### Example
- [[Google Maps API]]
### Details
- An Application Programming Interface (API) acts like a messenger between different software systems, ensuring they can talk to each other without the developer needing to understand how the other system works internally.
	- #question How is an API called for or used? Is an API a device?
- APIs come in different types:
	- [[REST APIs]] (Representational State Transfer) - Used for web applications, where clients make HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to interact with data.
	- [[SOAP APIs]] (Simple Object Access Protocol) - Used in enterprise applications for structured communication.
	- GraphQL APIs - Allow clients to request specific data, reducing unnecessary responses.
	- Operating System APIs - Like Windows API or macOS APIs, which allow software to interact with the OS.
## Source [^1]
- Application programming interface is a set of rules and definitions that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.
	- #question How does API work? Is it connected to a server?
	- #question I need more details about this. I don't understand application programming interfaces
	- #question How can software applications communicate with each other through API?
## Source[^2]
- An application programming interface (API) is code that enables two software programs to communicate.
## Source[^3]
- An interface that is defined in terms of a set of functions and procedures, and enables a program to gain access to facilities within an application. A typical example would be a CASE tool that provides an API to enable users to develop special programs to utilize the information within the CASE tool's internal database. The use of such facilities enables users to customize the application for their own purposes and to integrate the application into a customized development environment.
## Source[^4]
- An application program interface (API) refers to a set of parameters, protocols, and/or commands that determine how two software programs communicate with each other. Examples include the way the applications on your phone send data to the internet. APIs are critical software intermediaries that allow various data sets and programs to exchange information. As such, they are a critical component of the internet and are commonly used by software developers who are building applications for larger platforms. For instance, Apple and Google have numerous APIs.
