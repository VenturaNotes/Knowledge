- Unable to realize potential profit. Goods or services may be uncompetitive because their prices are too high relative to alternative suppliers, or may be unsaleable because of defects in quality, where other suppliers offer better products. Inability to compete may apply to a firm, a region, or a country. High costs may be due to dear or poor quality inputs of labour or materials, or to obsolete equipment and poor management. Products may be unsaleable at any price because of poor design, unreliability, failure to meet promised delivery dates, or failure to comply with health and safety regulations in possible markets.
