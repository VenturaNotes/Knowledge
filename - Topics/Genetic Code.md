## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- the code in which genetic information is carried by DNA and messenger RNA. This information determines the sequence of amino acids in every protein and thereby controls the nature of all proteins made by the cell. The genetic code is expressed by the sequence of nucleotide bases in the nucleic acid molecule, a unit of three consecutive bases (a codon) coding for each amino acid. The code is translated into protein at the ribosomes (see transcription; translation). Any changes in the genetic code result in the insertion of incorrect amino acids in a protein chain, giving a mutation.
## Source[^2]
- The means by which genetic information in DNA controls the manufacture of specific proteins by the cell. The code takes the form of a series of triplets of bases in DNA, from which is transcribed a complementary sequence of codons in messenger RNA (see transcription). The sequence of these RNA codons determines the sequence of amino acids during protein synthesis. There are 64 possible codes from the combinations of the four bases present in DNA and messenger RNA and 20 amino acids present in body proteins; also some codons have other functions (see START CODON; STOP CODON; WOBble). Hence, the code is redundant: i.e. any given amino acid can be encoded by more than one codon. However, it is not ambiguous$\textemdash$each codon specifies only one amino acid. See illustration.
