## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- the code in which genetic information is carried by DNA and messenger RNA. This information determines the sequence of amino acids in every protein and thereby controls the nature of all proteins made by the cell. The genetic code is expressed by the sequence of nucleotide bases in the nucleic acid molecule, a unit of three consecutive bases (a codon) coding for each amino acid. The code is translated into protein at the ribosomes (see transcription; translation). Any changes in the genetic code result in the insertion of incorrect amino acids in a protein chain, giving a mutation.
## Source[^2]
- The means by which genetic information in DNA controls the manufacture of specific proteins by the cell. The code takes the form of a series of triplets of bases in DNA, from which is transcribed a complementary sequence of codons in messenger RNA (see transcription). The sequence of these RNA codons determines the sequence of amino acids during protein synthesis. There are 64 possible codes from the combinations of the four bases present in DNA and messenger RNA and 20 amino acids present in body proteins; also some codons have other functions (see START CODON; STOP CODON; WOBble). Hence, the code is redundant: i.e. any given amino acid can be encoded by more than one codon. However, it is not ambiguous$\textemdash$each codon specifies only one amino acid. See illustration.

- $n$. The system by which genetic information is represented in the arrangement of the bases (1) of the DNA and RNA molecules, thereby determining the proteins to be synthesized by the cell. The four bases are arranged in triplets, each specifying a particular amino acid, and the amino acids combine to form proteins (see illustration). Mitochondrial DNA has its own genetic code, slightly different from the universal code of nuclear DNA and subject to variation between species. The idea of a genetic code in the sequence of bases was first suggested in 1954 (the year after the discovery of the double helix) by the Russian-born US physicist George Gamow (1904-68), but the dictionary of codons was worked out in detail between 1961 and 1967 by the US biochemist Marshall Warren Nirenberg (1927-2010), the Indian-born US molecular chemist Har Gobind Khorana (1922-2011), and the US biochemist Robert William Holley (1922-93), for which they shared a Nobel prize in 1968. See also CODON FAMILY, EXON, INTRON.

	- Genetic code. For RNA, the bases uracil (U), cytosine (C), adenine (A), and guanine (G), and the amino acids for which they code: Phe (phenylalanine), Leu (leucine), and so on. For DNA, substitute T for U throughout.
