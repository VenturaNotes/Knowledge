- (EEA) The organization formed in 1992 between the members of the European Union and the members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) except Switzerland. The EEA was intended to come into force in 1993, with the single market of the EU, but owing to Switzerland's rejection of the plan, this was delayed until 1994. The EEA is controlled by a committee of EU and EFTA members and meetings of ministers.
