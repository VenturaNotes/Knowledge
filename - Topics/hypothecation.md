- (1) An authority given to a banker, usually as a letter of hypothecation, to enable the bank to sell goods that have been pledged (see PLEDGE) to them as security for a loan. It applies when the bank is unable to obtain the goods themselves. The goods have often been pledged as security in relation to a documentary bill, the banker being entitled to sell the goods if the bill is dishonoured by non-acceptance or non-payment. 
- (2) A mortgage granted by a ship's master to secure the repayment with interest, on the safe arrival of the ship at her destination, of money borrowed during a voyage as a matter of necessity (e.g. to pay for urgent repairs). The hypothecation of a ship itself, with or without cargo, is called bottomry and is effected by a bottomry bond; that of its cargo alone is respondentia and requires a respondentia bond. The bondholder is entitled to a maritime lien. 
- (3) The practice of reserving the revenue from a tax or duty for spending on a particular stated purpose; for example dedicating revenues received from the tax on tobacco products to health spending.
