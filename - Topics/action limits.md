- The outer limits set on a control chart in a production process. If the observed value falls outside these limits, then action will be taken, often resetting the machine. For the means of samples of sizes $n$ in a process with standard deviation $\sigma$ with target mean $\mu$, the action limits will be set at $\mu \pm 3.09 \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}$
