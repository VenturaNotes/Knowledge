- (vermiform appendix) An outgrowth of the caecum in the alimentary canal. In herbivores, such as the horse, it is a relatively large, muscular organ that contains symbiotic microorganisms that help digest the plant-based diet. In humans it is a vestigial organ containing lymphatic tissue and serves no function in normal digestive processes. Appendicitis is caused by inflammation of the appendix.
