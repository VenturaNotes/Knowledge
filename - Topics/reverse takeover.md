- (1) The buying of a larger company by a smaller company. 
- (2) The purchasing of a public company by a private company. This may be the cheapest way that a private company can obtain a listing on a stock exchange, as it avoids the expenses of a flotation and it may be that the assets of the public company can be purchased at a discount. In the UK many such reverse takeovers are transacted on the Alternative Investment Market.
## Source[^2]
- A situation where a smaller company takes over a larger company, or where a private company takes over a public company. In the latter case the ownership is transferred to the company that is taken over, allowing a private company a possibly easier route to public ownership.
