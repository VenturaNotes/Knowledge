- Object data model (ODM) is a term used to describe the process of storing information about an object. This can include its properties, methods, and related data such as images or audio files. ODM allows developers to easily retrieve this information from databases without having to write code for each item they need access to. By using ODM, developers can focus on creating new features instead of writing repetitive queries every time they need to access data.
