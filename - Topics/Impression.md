- In digital marketing, an impression is the metric used to quantify the number of digital views a piece of online content, such as a post, web page, or advertisement, receives. To be clear, impressions do not measure how many times a piece of digital content is clicked on, but rather how many times it has been viewed. Businesses typically track the amount of impressions their online content receives to track their brand awareness.

- $n$. (in dentistry) a negative imprint (mould) of the teeth and surrounding soft tissues or of a toothless jaw. A soft impression material (e.g. silicone or alginate) is placed over the teeth or jaw and sets within several minutes, producing an elastic mould. Impressions may also be taken with hard-setting materials (e.g. plaster or zinc oxide-eugenol cement). From the impression, a positive reproduction (cast or model) can be made out of plaster or stone. On these are constructed restorations of teeth, dentures, or orthodontic appliances.
