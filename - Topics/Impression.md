- In digital marketing, an impression is the metric used to quantify the number of digital views a piece of online content, such as a post, web page, or advertisement, receives. To be clear, impressions do not measure how many times a piece of digital content is clicked on, but rather how many times it has been viewed. Businesses typically track the amount of impressions their online content receives to track their brand awareness.
