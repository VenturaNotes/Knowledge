- A clocked digital electronic device whose output takes up one and one only of a number, $n$, of distinct states upon the application of each clock pulse (see CLOCK). The output thus reflects the total number of clock pulses received by the counter up to its maximum capacity, $n$. All $n$ states are displayed sequentially for $n$ active transitions of the clock, the sequence then repeating. Since $n$ clocks pulses are required to drive the output between any two identical states, counters provide a 'divide-by-n action' and are thus also known as dividers
- A counter whose output is capable of displaying n discrete states before producing an overflow condition can also be called a [[mod-n-counter]] (or modulo-n counter), since it may be considered to be counting input pulses to a base of $n$. The value of $n$ is often an integer power of 2. Counters are generally formed by a cascaded series of clocked flip-flops (see CASCADABLE COUNTER), each of which provides a divide-by-two action. For a counter consisting of $m$ flip-flops, the maximum capacity of the counter will be $2^m$ since $2^m$ discrete output states are possible, i.e. $n$ is equal to $2^m$. These are known as binary counters
- Count lengths of other than integer multiples of two are possible. For example, a decade counter (or mod-10 counter) exhibits 10 separate and distinct states. To achieve this digitally requires a counter having at least four individual flip-flop elements, giving $2^4$ or 16 possible output states; six of these states are prevented from occurring by a suitable arrangement of logic gates around the individual flip-flops. In [[multimode counter|multimode counters]] the number, $n$, of distinct states can be selected by the user.
