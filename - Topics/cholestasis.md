- $n$. failure of normal amounts of bile to reach the intestine. This may be secondary to mechanical obstruction of the bile ducts, for example by gallstones or tumor (extrahepatic biliary obstruction), or to disturbances in bile formation (intrahepatic cholestasis). Many common drugs are associated with intrahepatic cholestasis, and it may occur in pregnancy (see OBSTETRIC CHOLESTASIS). The cardinal symptom of cholestasis is pruritus (itching); other symptoms include jaundice (more typical of extrahepatic cholestasis), dark urine, and pale stools.
