- $n$. degeneration of the walls of the arteries due to the formation in them of fatty plaques and scar tissue. This limits blood circulation and predisposes to thrombosis. A diet rich in animal fats (see CHOLESTEROL) and refined sugar, cigarette smoking, obesity, and inactivity are the principal causes. Individuals with diabetes, hypertension, or a family history of early atheroma are particularly predisposed to the condition. It may be symptomless but often causes complications from arterial obstruction in middle and late life (such as angina pectoris, heart attack, stroke, and gangrene). Treatment is by prevention, but some symptoms may be ameliorated by drug therapy (e.g. angina by glyceryl trinitrate), by surgical bypass of the arterial obstruction, or by atherectomy. $\textemdash$ atheromatous adj.
