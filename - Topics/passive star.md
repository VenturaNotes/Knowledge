- A network topology in which the outer nodes connect to a single central node that does not process the message in any way but simply connects the transmission paths between the outer nodes. The central node is unlikely to fail due to its passive operation. It is thus unlikely that the entire network will be disabled during normal operation. See also ACTIVE STAR, NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, STAR NETWORK.
