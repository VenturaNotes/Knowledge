- $n$. a method used to selectively destroy parts of the trabecular meshwork and hence reduce intraocular pressure in the treatment of glaucoma. This may be achieved by means of a laser, as in argon laser trabeculoplasty (ALT; see ARGON LASER) and selective laser trabeculoplasty (SLT), in which a YAG laser is used to selectively target melanin within the pigmented trabecular meshwork cells to achieve lowering of the intraocular pressure.
