- (Huntington's chorea) a hereditary disease caused by a defect in a single gene that is inherited as an autosomal dominant characteristic, therefore tending to appear in half of the children of the parents with this condition. Symptoms, which begin to appear in early middle age, include unsteady gait and jerky involuntary movements (see CHOREA), accompanied later by behavioral changes, and progressive dementia. There is a defect in the Huntington gene on chromosome 4; genetic screening is possible for those at risk. \[G. Huntington (1850-1916), US physician]
