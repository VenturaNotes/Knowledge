- (Huntington's chorea) a hereditary disease caused by a defect in a single gene that is inherited as an autosomal dominant characteristic, therefore tending to appear in half of the children of the parents with this condition. Symptoms, which begin to appear in early middle age, include unsteady gait and jerky involuntary movements (see CHOREA), accompanied later by behavioral changes, and progressive dementia. There is a defect in the Huntington gene on chromosome 4; genetic screening is possible for those at risk. \[G. Huntington (1850-1916), US physician]

- $n$. A rare hereditary disorder (affecting about 1 in 20,000 people) transmitted by a single dominant gene on the tip of chromosome 4, with damage to the basal ganglia, characterized by widespread degeneration of the brain, dementia, and chorea, with onset after the age of 40 and slow progression leading to death usually within 10-15 years. Also called Huntington's chorea. HD abbrev. \[Named after the US neurologist George S. Huntington (1850-1916) who described it in 1872, though it had already been described in 1841 by the US physician Charles Oscar Waters (1816-92) in a letter to the US-based English physiologist Robley Dunglison (1798-1869), who reported it in a book entitled Practice of Medicine (volume 2) in 1842]
