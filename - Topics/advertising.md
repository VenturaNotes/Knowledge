- Activity designed to sell products. It seeks to attract the attention of potential customers, inform them of the existence and attributes of a product, and persuade them to start or continue to buy it. It works via the media, that is, newspapers, television, or the internet; by shop displays, posters, or mailshots; or through the actual design of products themselves and their packaging. While there is a logical distinction between informative and persuasive advertising, psychologically these are extremely difficult to distinguish. Political, charitable, and religious bodies, and the government, advertise, as well as commercial organizations.
