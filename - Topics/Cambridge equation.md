- The formulation of the quantity theory of money as $M=k P Y$. Here $M$ is the demand for money balances, $P$ is the price level, $Y$ is the level of real national income, and $k$ is a parameter reflecting economic structure and monetary habits, namely the ratio of total transactions to income and the ratio of desired money balances to total transactions. The Cambridge equation is a modified form of the quantity equation, $M V=P T$, with $k=T /(V Y)$, where $V$ is the velocity of circulation and $T$ is the real volume of transactions.
