- Let $x$ be an approximation to a value $X$. According to some authors, the error is $X - x;$ for example, when 1.9 is used as an approximation for 1.875, the error equals $-0.025.$ Others define the error to be $x - X$. Whichever of these definitions is used, the error can be positive or negative. Yet other authors define the error to be $|X-x|$, the difference between the true value and the approximation, in which case the error is always non-negative. When contrasted with relative error, the error may be called the absolute error
