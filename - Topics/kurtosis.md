- Let $m_2 = E((X-\mu)^2)$ and $m_4 = E((X - \mu)^4)$, where $\mu = E(X)$, be the second and fourth moments about the mean. Then $\frac{m_4}{(m_2)^2}$ is the kurtosis of the distribution. For a normal distribution this has the value 3, which can be taken as a standard for comparison and hence a value of 3 is termed mesokurtic $\textemdash$ from 'meso' meaning 'middle'. For values less than 3, the distribution is termed platykurtic, and for the values greater than 3 it is leptokurtic

- A measure of how 'humped' a probability distribution is, compared to a normal distribution with the same mean and variance. The kurtosis of a variable $x$ with mean $\mu$ is defined by $K=E\left[(x-\mu)^{4}\right] /[E(x-\left.\mu)^{2}\right]^{2}$. A variable with a normal distribution has $K=3$. A distribution with $K$ $>3$ is slim and long-tailed, with more weight in its centre and extremes and less at medium distances from the mean than a normal distribution. A distribution with $K<3$ is fat and short-tailed, with less weight in its center and extremes and more at medium distances from the mean than a normal distribution.

- $n$. In statistics, a measure of the peakedness of a distribution indicating the degree to which a set of scores is concentrated around its mean. A distribution that is more concentrated about its mean than the normal distribution is leptokurtic, one that is concentrated like the normal distribution is mesokurtic, and a distribution that is flatter than the normal distribution is platykurtic. Compare skewness. \[From Greek kurtos arched + -osis indicating a process or state]
