- Let $m_2 = E((X-\mu)^2)$ and $m_4 = E((X - \mu)^4)$, where $\mu = E(X)$, be the second and fourth moments about the mean. Then $\frac{m_4}{(m_2)^2}$ is the kurtosis of the distribution. For a normal distribution this has the value 3, which can be taken as a standard for comparison and hence a value of 3 is termed mesokurtic $\textemdash$ from 'meso' meaning 'middle'. For values less than 3, the distribution is termed platykurtic, and for the values greater than 3 it is leptokurtic
