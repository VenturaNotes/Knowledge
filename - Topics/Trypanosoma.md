- $n$. a genus of parasitic protozoans that move by means of a long trailing flagellum and a thin wavy membrane, which project from the body surface. Trypanosomes undergo part of their development in the blood of a vertebrate host. The remaining stages occur in invertebrate hosts, which then transmit the parasites back to the vertebrates. T. rhodesiense and $T$. gambiense, which are transmitted through the bite of tsetse flies, cause sleeping sickness in Africa. T. cruzi, carried by reduviid bugs, causes Chagas' disease in South America.
