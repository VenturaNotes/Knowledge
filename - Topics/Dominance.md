## Synthesis
- The relationship between different versions of a gene, or alleles, that affect a trait
- [[Dominant allele]]
	- A dominant allele masks the effect of a recessive allele
- Examples of dominant traits
	- Eye color, such as brown eyes (B) being dominant over blue eyes (b)
	- Blood type, such as A being dominant over O
	- Male pattern baldness
	- Webbed fingers
	- Having a second toe that is longer than the first
- Other types of dominance
	- [[Incomplete dominance]]: A gene variant has a partial effect
	- [[Co-dominance]]: Different variants on each chromosome both show their associated traits
