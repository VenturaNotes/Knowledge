- In UNIX systems, a super server is a daemon used to manage other servers. A daemon is a program that runs in the background and performs similar tasks to Windows services. A superserver is usually programmed to start other servers as needed. In the conventional method, a server monitors a process on a port. If there are many ports, numerous processes will be waiting on the list, using up system resources such as memory. However, only the tiny servers will be maintained when you deploy a superserver, which means fewer resources are needed while inactive server functions are running.
