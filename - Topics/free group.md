- Given a set S, the free group $F(S)$ is the set of words using elements x of S and their formal inverses $x^{-1}$ with group operation being concatenation. Two distinct words are equal if and only if this involves replacing a product $xx^{-1}$ or $x^{-1}x$ with the identity $e$ or vice versa, that is, there are no non-trivial relations. Every group is a quotient group of a free group. See presentation.
