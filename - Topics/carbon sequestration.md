- Reduction of the amount of carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ emissions into the atmosphere either by capturing them at source, for example in the chimney of a power plant, and storing the $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ in a reservoir, or by creating and improving carbon sinks. Sequestration complements environmental policies that encourage the reduction of emissions of $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ and other greenhouse gases. The high cost of 'capture-ready' power plants and the availability of cheaper alternatives for power generation have made early sequestration projects economically unattractive.
