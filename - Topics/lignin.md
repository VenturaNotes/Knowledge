## Source [^1]
- A complex organic polymer that is deposited within the cellulose of plant cell walls during secondary thickening. Lignification makes the walls woody and therefore rigid, enabling plants to grow tall against the pull of gravity. It is the second most abundant biopolymer on earth, after cellulose. See SCLERENCHYMA.
