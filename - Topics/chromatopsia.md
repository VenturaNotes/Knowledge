- n. abnormal colored vision: a rare symptom of various conditions. Sometimes everything looks reddish to patients after removal of their cataracts; patients suffering from digitalis poisoning may see things in green or yellow. Similar disturbances of color may be experienced by people recovering from inflammation of the optic nerve.

- $n$. A form of partial blindness characterized by loss or serious impairment of all aspects of vision except color perception, resulting in a form of misidentification exemplified by guessing that a blue vehicle in a television picture is sky in spite of its different form, relative size, and movement. The condition is occasionally found in people who suffer the effects of smoke inhalation during fires, resulting in carbon monoxide poisoning and oxygen deprivation, causing widespread damage to most areas of the visual cortex apart from blobs in Area V1 and the associated thin stripes in Area V2, both of which mediate color perception and are more richly supplied with blood vessels than other areas of the visual cortex and therefore more likely to survive such conditions. Compare achromatopsia. chromatopsic adj. \[From Greek chroma, chromatos color + opsis sight, from ops an eye + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
