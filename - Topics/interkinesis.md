- An abbreviated form of interphase occurring between the first and second nuclear divisions of meiosis in some organisms. The chromosomes begin to uncoil, and there is at least partial re-formation of the nuclear envelope. However, in other organisms meiosis proceeds straight from anaphase I to metaphase II, more or less skipping telophase I, interphase, and prophase II.
