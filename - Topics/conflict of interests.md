- A situation that can arise if a person (or firm) acts in two or more separate capacities and the objectives in these capacities are not identical. The conflict may be between self-interest and the interest of a company for which a person works or it could arise when a person is a director of two companies, which find themselves competing. The proper course of action in the case of a conflict of interests is for the person concerned to declare any interests, to make known the way in which they conflict, and to abstain from voting or sharing in the decision-making procedure involving these interests.
