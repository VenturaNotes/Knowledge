- Shop floor control (SFC) is software that manages manufacturing work orders. It tracks and schedules work activities performed in manufacturing environments such as production plants. It provides users with insights into employees, materials, and manufacturing processes. Some SFC tools generate data visualizations that make it easier to view manufacturing work orders. Most software, however, calculates work orders based on their operation and completion.
