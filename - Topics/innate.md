## Source[^2]
- adj. Present in an organism from birth, hence inborn or congenital. Also, loosely, genetically determined rather than acquired by learning or attributable to environmental factors, though this meaning is avoided in careful usage, because a congenital characteristic is not necessarily genetic in origin. \[From Latin innatus inborn, from in in or into + nasci, natus born]
