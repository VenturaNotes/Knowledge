- The symbols used to enclose a group of symbols or numbers that are to be taken together. Brackets can be used to change the order in which operations are to be done. For example, $7 \times 2+3$ will be $14+3=17$. If the sum intended is $7 \times 5=35$ then brackets can be put round $2+3$ so that the sum is taken before the product, i.e. $7 \times(2+3)$. Brackets may appear as round brackets or parentheses (...), as square brackets \[...], or as braces $\{\ldots\}$, commonly used in set-theoretic notation. Brackets can be nested so that the whole contents of the inner bracket are treated as a single term in the larger bracket. The number of ways $n$ pairs of brackets can be nested equals the $n$th Catalan number. See also BIDMAS.
