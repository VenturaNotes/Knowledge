- $n$. A form of social influence in which the deviant subgroup rejects the established group norm $(1,2)$ and persuades the majority to the minority attitude, opinion, belief, or behavior pattern, thereby changing the norm. The concept was introduced by the Romanianborn French social psychologist Serge Moscovici (born 1925) in his book Social Influence and Social Change (1976), in which he argued that the conflict caused by minorities is a force for innovation. Minorities are most influential when they are consistent, consensual, and in line with the underlying values of the group.
