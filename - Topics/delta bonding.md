- Chemical bonding involving delta ($\delta$) orbitals. A $\delta$ orbital is so called because it resembles a d-orbital when viewed along the axis of a molecule and has two units of orbital angular momentum around the internuclear axis. The formation of $\delta$ bonds originates in the overlap of d-orbitals on different atoms. Delta orbitals contribute to the bonding of cluster compounds of transition metals.
