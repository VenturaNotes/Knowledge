## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Involving or requiring a form of computer control operation in which sequential events take place at fixed times, usually determined by a clock signal of fixed frequency. This requires predetermination of the length of time required by each class/set of events; it requires no acknowledgment that preceding events have been completed. Compare ASYNCHRONOUS.
## Source[^2]
- Synchronous communications have a constant time interval between consecutive pieces of data or events. One example is real-time streaming video via services such as YouTube or Netflix, transmitted continuously to your device. Both systems—the sender and the receiver—must be "in sync" so that the receiver knows when one block of information ends and another begins.
