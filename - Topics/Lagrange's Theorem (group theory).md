- For a group G with subgroup H, the (left or right) cosets of H partition G and are equinumerous. Thus, if G is finite, the order of H divides the order of G, and the order of any group element divides the order of G. The converse is true for finite abelian groups, but is not generally true $\textemdash$ for example, the alternating group $A_4$ has order 12 and no subgroup of order 6
