## Source [^1]
- Computing based on the use of logic elements, in the form of optical switches, that employ light beams as logic signals instead of the voltage or current levels of conventional electronic logic elements. These optical switches may use light beams exclusively or a combination of electronic and optical signals, depending on the application.
