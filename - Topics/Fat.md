## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a substance that contains one or more fatty acids in the form of triglycerides and is the principal form in which energy is stored by the body (in adipose tissue). It also serves as an insulating material beneath the skin (in the subcutaneous tissue) and around certain organs (including the kidneys). Fat is one of the three main constituents of food (see also CARBOHYDRATE; PROTEIN); it is necessary in the diet to provide an adequate supply of essential fatty acids and for the efficient absorption of fatsoluble vitamins from the intestine. Excessive deposition of fat in the body leads to obesity. See also BROWN FAT; LIPID.
## Source[^2]
- A mixture of lipids, chiefly triglycerides, that is solid at normal body temperatures. Fats occur widely in plants and animals as a means of storing food energy, having twice the calorific value of carbohydrates. In mammals, fat is deposited in a layer beneath the skin (subcutaneous fat) and deep within the body as a specialized adipose tissue (see also BROWN FAT). The insulating properties of fat are also important, especially in animals lacking fur and those inhabiting cold climates (e.g. seals and whales).
- Fats derived from plants and fish generally have a greater proportion of unsaturated fatty acids than those from mammals. Their melting points thus tend to be lower, causing a softer consistency at room temperatures. Highly unsaturated fats are liquid at room temperatures and are therefore more properly called oils.
