- $n$. a substance that contains one or more fatty acids in the form of triglycerides and is the principal form in which energy is stored by the body (in adipose tissue). It also serves as an insulating material beneath the skin (in the subcutaneous tissue) and around certain organs (including the kidneys). Fat is one of the three main constituents of food (see also CARBOHYDRATE; PROTEIN); it is necessary in the diet to provide an adequate supply of essential fatty acids and for the efficient absorption of fatsoluble vitamins from the intestine. Excessive deposition of fat in the body leads to obesity. See also BROWN FAT; LIPID.
