- a measure of the intellectual level at which an individual functions; for example, someone described as having a mental age of six years would be functioning at the level of an average six-year-old child. This measure has largely been replaced by a comparison of the functioning of persons of the same age group (see INTELLIGENCE QUOTIENT; INTELLIGENCE TEST).

- $n$. A child's performance on a test of mental ability expressed as the average age of children who achieved the same level of performance in a standardization sample. Thus a 10-year-old child who achieves the same score as the average 12-year-old child in a standardization sample has a mental age of 12. The concept was introduced in 1905 by the French psychologists Alfred Binet (1857-1911) and Th√©odore Simon (1873-1961). See also Binet-Simon scale, iq. Compare chronological age, social age. MA abbrev.
