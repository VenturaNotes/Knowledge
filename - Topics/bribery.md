- Under the Bribery Act 2010, the offense committed by anyone who gives, offers, or promises 'financial or other advantage' to induce another individual to act 'improperly' in the performance of 'any function of a public nature' or 'any activity connected with a business, trade, or profession'. Such a function is performed 'improperly' when the performance breaches: (i) a reasonable expectation of good faith or impartiality; or (ii) a reasonable expectation of how a person in a position of trust should behave. The Act likewise makes it an offense to accept or solicit bribes and creates the specific offense of bribing foreign public officials. The maximum penalty is 10 years' imprisonment together with an unlimited fine.
- Under the Act a commercial organization commits an offense wherever it fails to prevent bribery on its behalf by any 'associated person'. Even where there is no deliberate wrongdoing or direct knowledge on the part of the organization, it will be guilty of the offense unless it can show that it has 'adequate procedures' to prevent bribery by third parties.
- Before the passage of the 2010 Act, the term 'bribery' referred specifically to the common-law offense of making improper payments to judges, magistrates, or other judicial officers. Offenses relating more generally to the improper influencing of public servants and other persons in a position of trust were referred to as corruption.
