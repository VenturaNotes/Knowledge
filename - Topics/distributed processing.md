The processes exchange information with each other over a data communication network to process data or to read decisions that affect multiple processes.

- A system of processing data in which several computers are used at various locations within an organization instead of using one central computer. The computers may be linked to each other in a local area network, allowing them to cooperate, or they may be linked to a larger central computer, although a significant amount of the processing is done without reference to the central computer.
