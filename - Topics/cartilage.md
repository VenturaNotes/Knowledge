- $n$. a dense connective tissue composed of a matrix produced by cells called chondroblasts, which become embedded in the matrix as chondrocytes. It is a semiopaque grey or white substance, consisting chiefly of chondroitin sulphate, that is capable of withstanding considerable pressure. There are three types: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage (see illustration). In the fetus and infant cartilage occurs in many parts of the body, but most of this cartilage disappears during development. In the adult, hyaline cartilage is found in the costal cartilages, larynx, trachea, bronchi, nose, and covering the surface of bones at joints, where wear and damage results in osteoarthritis. Elastic cartilage occurs in the external ear, and fibrocartilage in the intervertebral discs and tendons. Cartilage is the precursor of bone following a fracture (see CALLUS).
