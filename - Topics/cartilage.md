- $n$. a dense connective tissue composed of a matrix produced by cells called chondroblasts, which become embedded in the matrix as chondrocytes. It is a semiopaque grey or white substance, consisting chiefly of chondroitin sulphate, that is capable of withstanding considerable pressure. There are three types: hyaline cartilage, elastic cartilage, and fibrocartilage (see illustration). In the fetus and infant cartilage occurs in many parts of the body, but most of this cartilage disappears during development. In the adult, hyaline cartilage is found in the costal cartilages, larynx, trachea, bronchi, nose, and covering the surface of bones at joints, where wear and damage results in osteoarthritis. Elastic cartilage occurs in the external ear, and fibrocartilage in the intervertebral discs and tendons. Cartilage is the precursor of bone following a fracture (see CALLUS).

## Source[^2]
- (gristle) A firm flexible connective tissue that forms the adult skeleton of cartilaginous fish (e.g. sharks). In other vertebrates cartilage forms the skeleton of the embryo, being largely replaced by bone in mature animals (although it persists in certain areas). Cartilage comprises a matrix consisting chiefly of a glycosaminoglycan (mucopolysaccharide) called chondroitin sulphate secreted by cells (chondroblasts) that become embedded in the matrix as chondrocytes. It also contains collagenous and elastic fibers. Hyaline cartilage consists largely of glycosaminoglycan, giving it a shiny glasslike appearance; this type of cartilage gives flexibility and support at the joints. Fibrocartilage, in which bundles of collagen fibers predominate, is stronger and less elastic than hyaline cartilage; it is found in such areas as the intervertebral discs. Elastic cartilage has a yellow appearance due to the presence of numerous elastic fibers (see Elastin). This cartilage maintains the shape of certain organs, such as the pinna of the ear.
