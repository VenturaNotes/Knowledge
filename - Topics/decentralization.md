- (1) The dispersal of the power and duty to take decisions away from the centre and towards other bodies. Within the public sector this means leaving decisions to local or regional government rather than central government. In the private sector it means devolving decisions to divisions or subsidiaries of firms instead of taking them at headquarters. Decentralization may also be pursued by transferring decisions from the state to private bodies such as housing associations, or by breaking up monopolistic companies.
- (2) The attainment of a chosen economic allocation by the redistribution of initial resources followed by competitive trading. The practical relevance of the decentralization argument depends on the extent to which resources can be redistributed and the absence of market failure. See also Fundamental Theorems of Welfare Economics.

- The delegation of decision-making responsibilities to the subunits of an organization. The advantages claimed for decentralization are that local managers are more aware of immediate problems, are better motivated, and have greater control over local circumstances. The disadvantages of decentralization are the possibility of wasteful competition between subunits, the duplication of certain services and functions, and the loss of central control and access to information. See DIVISIONALIZATION.
