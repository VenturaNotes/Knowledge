- Instructor-led training in the classroom (ILTC) refers to when an instructor provides training to learners in a classroom environment. It differs from eLearning, where learners access training resources via the internet. ILTC is the most popular type of training and is often used in higher education and commercial training courses. It typically involves an instructor giving lectures to learners about a specific topic.
