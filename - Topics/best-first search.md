- A search of a directed graph or tree in which a set of 'best yet' nodes are maintained. As nodes are visited an evaluation function is used to estimate their value (in terms of a problem solution), and the search proceeds by exploring the node with the best value from the set of best yet nodes. The A algorithm is an example method.
