- $n$. an antibiotic, derived from the bacterium Streptomyces orientalis, that is effective against most Gram-positive organisms (e.g. streptococci and staphylococci). Used for treating serious infections (including endocarditis and MRSA) due to strains that are resistant to other antibiotics, it usually has a low toxicity but may cause deafness and blood disorders. Vancomycin and teicoplanin (a related drug with similar uses) are known as glycopeptide antibiotics.
