- $n$. Sudden fear or alarm. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) distinguished in 1920 between fright (German Schreck), anxiety (Angst), and fear (Furcht): fright 'is the name we give to the state a person gets into when he has run into danger without being prepared for it'; anxiety 'describes a particular state of expecting the danger or preparing for it, even though it may be an unknown one'; and fear 'requires a definite object of which to be afraid' (Beyond the Pleasure Principle, Standard Edition, XVIII, pp. 7-64, at pp. 12-13).
