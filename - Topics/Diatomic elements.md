## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Some elements do not exist alone in nature as individual atoms. These diatomic elements are found as covalently-bonded pairs, like [[molecular oxygen]] ($O_2$)
- Other diatomic elements:
	- $H_2, N_2, F_2, Cl_2, I_2, \text { and } Br_2$ 
- Diatomic elements are considered [[molecule|molecules]], but not compounds. A [[compound]] must have two different elements bonded together
