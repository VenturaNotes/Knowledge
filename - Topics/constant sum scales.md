- Scales used in marketing research asking the respondent to divide (usually) 100 points between two or more attributes based on their importance to the respondent. For example, the respondent may be asked to allocate points to the attributes speed, comfort, fuel consumption, and reliability by a car manufacturer. If the average scores of all respondents are: speed 10 , comfort 10 , fuel consumption 30 , and reliability 50 , the manufacturer will have useful information to assist the engineering and design departments.
