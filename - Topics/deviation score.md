- $n$. In statistics, a score representing the difference between the raw score and the arithmetic mean of the raw scores in the group to which it belongs. For example, in the group of raw scores 1, 4, 10, the mean is 5, so the corresponding deviation scores are $(1-5),(4-5)$, and $(10-5)$, that is, $-4,-1$, and 5 . The term is also used to refer to a score expressed in units of standard deviations, also called a z score.
