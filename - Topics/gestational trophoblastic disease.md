- (GTD) a group of disorders spanning the conditions of complete and partial molar pregnancies (see HYDATIDIFORM MOLE) through to the malignant conditions of invasive mole, choriocarcinoma, and the very rare placental site trophoblastic tumor (PSTT). If there is any evidence of persistence of GTD, most commonly defined as a persistent elevation of human chorionic gonadotrophin, the condition is described as gestational trophoblastic neoplasia.
