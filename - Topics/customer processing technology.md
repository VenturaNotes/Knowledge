- The technology that either provides the immediate interface between an organization and its customers (e.g. a bank automated teller machine) or facilitates human interaction with customers. Direct interaction between the customer and the organization has traditionally been a low-technology activity. Increasingly, information technology is being used to make that interaction more efficient; for example, by giving salespersons up-to-date product information and allowing them to transmit orders instantly. This both speeds the back-office operation and makes customers feel that they have received a more customized and responsive service.
