- An insurance policy covering personal possessions against many risks but not, of course, all risks. A policy of this kind does not list the risks covered; instead it lists only the exclusions. Such wide cover often merits very high premiums and items covered on this basis often include jewellery, photographic or electronic equipment, and other valuables.
