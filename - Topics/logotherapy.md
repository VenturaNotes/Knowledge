- n. A form of psychotherapy developed by the Austrian psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl (1905-97) that capitalizes on people's will to meaning (rather than their will to power or the will to pleasure), attempts to restore a sense of meaning by encouraging meaningful and creative activities and experiences of art, nature, and culture, and encourages self-acceptance and an appreciation of one's place in the world by a close study of one's attitudes to work, love, and life in general, using techniques such as paradoxical intention and de-reflection. \[From Greek logos word, discourse, or reason + English therapy, intended to denote meaning-centred therapy]
