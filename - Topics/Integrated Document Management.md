- Integrated document management (IDM) combines library services, document-interchange technologies, and document manufacturing with business-process applications. In other words, it integrates the tools, technologies, and techniques organizations use to manage documents. IDM turns document management from an end-user application (a system designed for one person) to a network-based service (a system that benefits an entire organization). It can include custom-developed applications that optimize document management, making it easier to capture information on files, store paperwork, back up documents and protect documents from unauthorized access.
