- (HDL) the smallest and densest of the lipoproteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides around the body, which is derived mainly from precursors produced in the liver. HDL has an important role in reverse cholesterol transfer, i.e. the removal of cholesterol from the circulation and the blood vessel walls and its transfer to the liver. Higher levels of HDL have been shown to be associated with lower levels of cardiovascular disease.
