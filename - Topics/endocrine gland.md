- (ductless gland) a gland that manufactures one or more hormones and secretes them directly into the bloodstream (and not through a duct to the exterior). Endocrine glands include the pituitary, thyroid, parathyroid, and adrenal glands, the ovary and testis, the placenta, and part of the pancreas.
## Source[^2]
- (ductless gland) Any gland in an animal that manufactures hormones and secretes them directly into the bloodstream to act at distant sites in the body (known as target organs or cells). Endocrine glands tend to control slow long-term activities in the body, such as growth and sexual development. In mammals they include the pituitary, adrenal, thyroid and parathyroid glands, the pineal gland, the ovary and testis, the placenta, and part of the pancreas (see ISLETS OF LANGERHANS). The activity of endocrine glands is controlled by negative feedback, i.e. a rise in output of hormone inhibits a further increase in its production, either directly or indirectly via the target organ or cell. See also NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM. Compare EXOCRINE GLAND.

- $n$. Any of the ductless glands, including the adrenal glands, islets of Langerhans, ovaries, parathyroid glands, pineal gland, pituitary gland, testes, thymus gland, and thyroid glands, that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream, where they come into contact with specific receptors on target cells, allowing the endocrine system to function as an extensive signaling system within the body, alongside but independently of the nervous system. Secretions from the hypothalamus control those of the pituitary gland, the master endocrine gland, and secretions from the pituitary in turn control those of the other endocrine glands. Also called a ductless gland. Compare exocrine gland. See also NEUROENDOCRINE. \[From Greek endon within + krinein to separate]
