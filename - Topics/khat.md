- (qat, kat) n. the leaves of the shrub Catha edulis, which contain a stimulant. In Yemen these leaves are wrapped around betel nuts and chewed: this habit is associated with the development of oral leukoplakia. In 2014 khat became a class-C drug in the UK owing to its increasing use. Possession of the drug can result in up to two years in prison and an unlimited fine.
