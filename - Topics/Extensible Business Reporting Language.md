- The eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) is a free global standard for managing and exchanging financial information. It replaces text-based reporting by letting businesses access, compare, and review information in a computer-readable format. XBRL tags each dataset, making it easier to search for and find relevant information. Many organizations display financial statements in the XBRL format.
