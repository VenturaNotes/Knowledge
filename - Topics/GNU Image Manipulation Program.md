- GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP) is a free, open-source raster graphics editing software program that graphic and web designers often use to create user interface mockups, logos, animations, and web designs. Photographers often use GIMP to crop, retouch, and adjust the color and lighting elements of photographs.
- Photography companies often use GIMP as their primary editing tool because it offers a variety of editing features and simplifies the photo editing process. The tools and features of GIMP include free-form drawing, automatic image enhancing, image cropping, color correction and adjustment, layer masking, and even animation capabilities.
- GIMP is supported by all major operating systems, including Windows OS, macOS, and Linux OS.
