- Removal of land from agricultural production. Farmers may be either compelled or paid to set aside part of their land. Set-aside is part of agricultural policy, in particular the Common Agricultural Policy of the European Union. Set-aside land may be allowed to lie fallow, or may be diverted to forestry, or, subject to planning permission, to amenity or residential use.
