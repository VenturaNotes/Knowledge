- (BRUE) a sudden, brief (less than 30 to 60 seconds), and resolved episode in an infant that includes one or more of the following: decreased or irregular breathing; change in muscle tone; pallor or cyanosis or altered responsiveness. The episode is frightening for the person caring for the infant. BRUE is a description rather than a diagnosis and the term is used only when there is no explanation for the event after a thorough history and examination.
