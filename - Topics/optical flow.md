- An image in which the color of a pixel represents the motion occurring at that location in the image. An optical flow field is the instantaneous velocity vector field for an image of a moving environment. From operations on local velocity contours it is possible to deduce the movements of objects in the image and the general relative movement of the observer. See also active VISION.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. The instantaneous velocity of points in a retinal image or visual field, resulting either from movements of objects or images in the visual field or from movements of the head or eyes. Also called optic flow.
