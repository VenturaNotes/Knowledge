- A generalization of expected utility theory. The alternative outcomes are ranked from lowest to highest, and the probabilities of the outcomes are transformed in a way that ensures unlikely extreme outcomes are over-weighted. If $\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ are the ranked outcomes and $\left(p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}\right)$ the probabilities with which they occur, then the rank dependent expected utility function is $U=\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}\left(p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}\right) U\left(x_{i}\right)$, where $w_{i}\left(p_{1}, \ldots, p_{n}\right), i=1, \ldots, n$, are the weighting functions. The motivation for this construction is to obtain a pay-off function that can explain the choices observed in the Allais paradox and other similar anomalies.
