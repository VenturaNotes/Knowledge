- any disorder of the blood vessels of the brain and its covering membranes (meninges). Most cases are due to atheroma and/or hypertension, clinical effects being caused by rupture of diseased blood vessels (cerebral or subarachnoid haemorrhage) or inadequacy of the blood supply to the brain (ischaemia), due to cerebral thrombosis or embolism. The term cerebrovascular accident is given to the clinical syndrome accompanying a sudden and sometimes severe attack, which leads to a stroke.
