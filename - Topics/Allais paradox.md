- An example of choice under uncertainty where the outcome for most experimental subjects violates the axioms of expected utility theory. In the first experiment subjects are requested to choose between winning $£ 1$ million for sure and a gamble in which the prizes are $£ 1$ million with probability $0.89, £ 5$ million with probability 0.10 , and nothing with probability 0.01. Most experimental subjects would choose the option of $£ 1$ million for sure. In the second experiment the choice is between two different gambles. For the first gamble the prizes are nothing with probability 0.89 and $£ 1$ million with probability 0.11. The second gamble has prizes of nothing with probability 0.90 and $£ 5$ million with probability 0.10. Most subjects choose the second gamble. These typical choices violate the independence axiom of expected utility theory: if the first option is chosen in the first experiment then the first option should also be chosen in the second experiment. The Allais paradox and other similar examples have motivated the search for alternatives to expected utility theory. See also ANOMALIES; BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS; DECISION THEORY; PROSPECT THEORY.

- Allais paradox n. A paradox of decision making that usually elicits responses inconsistent with expected utility theory. First, a choice is made between
	- $A~ \$ 500,000$ with probability 1 (certainty)
	- $B~ \$ 2,500,000, \$ 500,000$, or $\$ 0$ with probabilities 10 per cent, 89 per cent, and 1 per cent respectively.
- Second, a choice is made between
	- $C ~\$ 500,000$ or $\$ 0$ with probabilities 11 per cent and 89 per cent
	- $D~ \$ 2,500,000$ or $\$ 0$ with probabilities 10 per cent and 90 per cent respectively.
- Most people prefer $A$ to $B$, because they prefer the certainty of winning a large amount to the small probability of winning an even larger amount coupled with a risk of winning nothing at all. But most of the same people prefer $D$ to $C$, because the chances of winning are nearly the same in both cases but the prize is much larger in $D$ than in $C$. Writing $u(2,500,000)$, $u(500,000)$, and $u(0)$ for the utilities that a person attaches to the corresponding amounts of money, the first preference implies that$$.11 u(500,000)>.10 u(2,500,000)+.01 u(0)$$and the second implies that$$.11 u(500,000)<.10 u(2,500,000)+.01 u(0)$$a contradiction, showing that expected utility theory does not accurately describe human choice behavior.
