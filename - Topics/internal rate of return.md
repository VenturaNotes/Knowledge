- (IRR) An interest rate that gives a net present value of zero when applied to the projected cash flow from an asset, liability, or financial decision. This interest rate, where the present values of the cash inflows and outflows are equal, is the internal rate of return for a project under consideration, and the decision to adopt the project will depend on its size compared with the cost of capital. The approximate IRR can be computed manually by interpolation but most computer spreadsheet programs now include a routine enabling the IRR to be computed quickly and accurately. The IRR technique suffers from the possibility of multiple solution rates in some circumstances. If it suggests a different decision to that obtained from net present value it should be disregarded, because net present value is a superior decision tool.
## Source[^2]
- (IRR) The interest rate at which the net present value of a project is zero. If the net cash flow on a project starts off negative, and once it becomes positive it remains so, the IRR is unique; but if cash flow at the end becomes negative, as can happen if there are costs of making a plant safe after its useful life is over, the IRR may not be unique. A project is worth investing in if its IRR exceeds the sum of the risk-free rate of interest and an appropriate risk premium.
