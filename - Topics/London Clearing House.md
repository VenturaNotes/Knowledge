- (LCH) A clearing house established in 1888 (known before 1991 as the International Commodities Clearing House). It provides commodities, futures and options markets with netting and settlement services as well as becoming a counterparty (see COUNTERPARTY RISK) to every transaction between its members. In this capacity LCH takes the risk of its members defaulting, which it covers by collecting margins from members; it also provides an independent guarantee from its shareholders and from the insurance market. Exchanges making use of LCH facilities include the London Stock Exchange, the London Metal Exchange, and the International Petroleum Exchange (ICE Futures Europe). In 2003 LCH merged with the Continental clearing house Clearnet to form LCH.Clearnet; the group serves markets across Europe and is the sole clearer for Euronext NV.
