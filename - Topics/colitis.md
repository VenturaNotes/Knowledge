- $n$. inflammation of the colon due to infection, inflammation, or ischaemia. It is diagnosed by clinical assessment combined with radiological imaging, stool cultures, and endoscopic evaluation. Infectious colitis may be due to viruses, bacteria, or protozoans (for example, Entamoeba histolytica causes amoebic colitis: see DYSENTERY). Inflammatory colitis encompasses Crohn's disease (Crohn's colitis), ulcerative colitis, and microscopic colitis. Microscopic colitis can only be seen under a microscope (at endoscopy the colon appears normal). Symptoms of inflammatory colitis may include diarrhoea, abdominal pain, and the passage of blood and mucus in the stools. Ischaemic colitis occurs when there is partial or complete cessation of the blood supply to a particular region of the colon.
