- A catchphrase coined by Flip Wilson in his ‘Geraldine Jones’ impersonation in 1969. In computer systems it has come to mean a system where the screen displays text and graphics almost exactly as it would be printed. There may be minor differences in resolution and fonts used. Wysiwyg is considered to be a desirable feature of word processing, desktop publishing, and other programs where the appearance of the final printed product is important
## Source[^2]
- WYSIWYG is an acronym that stands for “what you see is what you get.” This term is often used in the software development industry to describe a type of editing software that allows users to edit content in the same form that it would be displayed as a finished product. WYSIWYG software allows users to manipulate the layout of documents without having to type out editing commands. Today, many content management systems (CMSs) are considered WYSIWYG solutions, as they allow web developers to create dynamic websites using little to no code.
