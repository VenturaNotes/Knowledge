- A catchphrase coined by Flip Wilson in his ‘Geraldine Jones’ impersonation in 1969. In computer systems it has come to mean a system where the screen displays text and graphics almost exactly as it would be printed. There may be minor differences in resolution and fonts used. Wysiwyg is considered to be a desirable feature of word processing, desktop publishing, and other programs where the appearance of the final printed product is important
