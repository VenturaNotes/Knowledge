- Codd refers to Ted Codd, who did a lot of work on relational databases, which are the standard types of databases used by many businesses. Codd’s Rule Zero is used for classifying relational database management systems, or RDBMSs. The rule ensures that these types of databases are truly relational. Even if other factors come into play, the relational nature of the way data is managed has to be the core function. It’s called “Rule Zero” because it’s considered the fundamental rule for all RDBMSs.
