- For a sample from a population with an unknown parameter, the likelihood function is the probability that the sample could have occurred at random; it is a function of the unknown parameter. The method of the maximum likelihood estimator selects the value of the parameter that maximizes the likelihood function. The concept applies equally well when there are two or more unknown parameters.
