- Condorcet paradox The observation that the preference order resulting from pairwise majority voting can be intransitive. Assume there are three options $x, y$, and $z$, and three individuals $A, B$, and $C$. Assume the individuals rank the alternatives as follows (preferred option given first): $A$ : $x, y, z ; B: y, z, x$; and $C: z, x, y$. If a vote is taken over the pair $x$ and $y$ then $x$ will win with a majority of two votes against one. Similarly, $y$ will defeat $z$, and $z$ will defeat $x$. The preference order obtained from the voting process is cyclical, and therefore intransitive. The Condorcet paradox was an early example of Arrow's impossibility theorem. See also COLLECTIVE CHOICE.
