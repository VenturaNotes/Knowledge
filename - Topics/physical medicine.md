- a medical specialty established by the Royal Society of Medicine in 1931. Initially the members pioneered clinics devoted to the diagnosis and management of rheumatic diseases, but later extended their interests to the rehabilitation of patients with physical disabilities ranging from asthma and hand injuries to back trouble and poliomyelitis. The term has caused confusion in recent years, with many doctors preferring the description rheumatology and rehabilitation for this specialist activity. Since 1972, however, when the Royal College of Physicians approved it, physical medicine has become the generally accepted term. See also RHEUMATOLOGY.
