- $n$. (in psychology) a technique of behavior modification in which a complex skill is taught by being broken down into its separate components, which are gradually built up into the full sequence. Usually the last component in the sequence is taught first, because it is this component that is followed by reinforcement: this is termed backwards chaining.
