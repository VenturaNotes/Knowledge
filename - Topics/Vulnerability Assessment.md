- A vulnerability assessment evaluates a company's systems and networks to determine whether they have been compromised or if any other weaknesses may allow hackers access. This type of testing can help businesses identify potential threats before they become a problem so they can take steps toward fixing them quickly. It also allows them to test their existing security measures against new vulnerabilities as new attack methods are developed.
