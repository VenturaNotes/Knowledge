- $n$. Preferences violating the condition that if one alternative is preferred to a second, and the second is preferred to a third, then the first should be preferred to the third. The following is the simplest example of intransitive preferences: $x$ is preferred to $y, y$ to $z$, and $z$ to $x$. It is often interpreted as necessarily irrational, but it can arise from the aggregation of rational individual preferences into a group preference ranking, as in Condorcet's paradox, and it can even arise plausibly in an individual's preferences from a lexicographic semiorder, or when multiple attributes are involved, as in a person who rates three similarly priced cars, $x, y$, and $z$ on three equally important attributes as follows:

- This person evidently prefers $x$ to $y$ because it is better on two of the three equally valued attributes, $y$ to $z$ for the same reason, and $z$ to $x$ for the same reason.
