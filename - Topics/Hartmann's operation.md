- a method of reconstruction after surgical removal of the distal colon and proximal rectum, in which the rectal stump is closed off and the divided end of the colon is brought out as a colostomy. The technique allows for a second operation to join up the bowel ends and obviates the need for a stoma. It is often used temporarily where primary anastomosis is unsafe (e.g. in cases of perforated diverticular disease) or permanently as a palliative procedure (e.g. for unresectable colonic cancer). \[H. Hartmann (1860-1952), French surgeon]
