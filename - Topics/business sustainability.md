- The term business sustainability refers to a corporationâ€™s efforts to reduce or eliminate the negative environmental and social impact it may cause in the world. Many businesses often struggle to balance business profitability with environmentally and socially ethical practices (also referred to as the triple bottom line). For instance, to be more socially ethical, businesses can provide a healthy environment for their workforce. This may include purchasing ergonomic office furniture or offering competitive wages. Companies can be more environmentally ethical by using energy-efficient lighting in the workplace and encouraging their employees to recycle their food and beverage containers while at work. Organizations that engage in sustainable business practices and prioritize their triple bottom line often gain a more positive public reputation, lower overhead costs, and increase employee retention rates.
