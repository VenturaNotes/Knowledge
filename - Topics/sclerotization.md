- A process in which proteins undergo natural hardening, or 'tanning', as in conversion of the relatively soft elastic larval protein into the rigid cuticle of the adult insect. A similar process occurs following moulting (see ECDYSIS). Enzymatically generated orthoquinones react with the free amino groups of the cuticular proteins to form crosslinkages, thereby producing a hard rigid covering consisting of structural proteins called sclerotins.
