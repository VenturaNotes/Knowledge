## Source [^1]
- $n$. a small cell produced as an intermediate stage in the formation of spermatozoa. Spermatids become embedded in Sertoli cells in the testis. They are transformed into spermatozoa by the process of spermiogenesis (see SPERMATOGENESIS).
## Source[^2]
- A nonmotile cell, produced during spermatogenesis, that subsequently differentiates into a mature spermatozoon. Four spermatids are formed after two meiotic divisions of a primary spermatocyte and therefore contain the haploid number of chromosomes.
