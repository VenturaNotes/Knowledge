- instrumental introduction of semen into the vagina in order that a woman may conceive. Insemination is timed to coincide with the day on which the woman is expected to ovulate (see MENSTRUAL CYCLE). The semen specimen may be provided by the husband (AIH artificial insemination husband), for example in cases of erectile dysfunction, or by an anonymous donor (DI - donor insemination), usually in cases where the husband is sterile.
