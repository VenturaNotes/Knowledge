- A scale on a diagram where distances from the origin represent the logarithm of a variable. Logarithmic scales are used particularly in diagrams with time on one, usually the horizontal, axis, and some real or nominal variable such as gross domestic product or the price level on the vertical axis. The slope of a curve in such a diagram shows the proportional growth rate of the variable, and a constant proportional growth trend is represented by a straight line. If both axes use logarithmic scales, the slope of a curve is proportional to the elasticity of one variable with respect to the other. Neither zero nor negative numbers can be represented on a Logarithmic scale.
