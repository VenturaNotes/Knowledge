- $n$. the end stage of every person's life, lasting often for several days before the actual death. Having a duty to save life, clinicians may fail to notice the moment when death becomes inevitable and they must now provide the care appropriate for a dying patient. This point is recognized by a change in demeanour, social involvement, and even vital signs, and in some cases the patient may tell (or try to tell) others, including professional carers, that this is happening. In the best care, after the physician recognizes the patient's state, treatments that may be burdensome are stopped and replaced by those that may benefit someone dying: symptom relief is the key factor. See also HOSPICE; PALLIATIVE.
