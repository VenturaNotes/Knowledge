- Incomes received by residents of a country from activities carried out abroad. This includes remittances by migrants working abroad, profits earned by companies operating abroad, and interest received on loans made abroad. Gross factor incomes from abroad are the total amounts so received; net factor incomes from abroad are these receipts minus any expenditure on similar items earned within the country by non-residents. Net factor incomes from abroad can thus be negative.
