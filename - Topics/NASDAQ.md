- A US electronic market for securities that began operations in 1971, as the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations System. The first screen-based trading system to have no market floor, it is now the second-largest stock market in the USA, listing more than 3,000 companies. The system was owned and operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. until 2002. In 2008 NASDAQ acquired the Swedish exchange group OMX.
