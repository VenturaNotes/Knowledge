- the total number of events (e.g. cases of lung cancer) expressed as a rate per 1000 population. When factors such as age structure or sex of populations can significantly affect the rates (as in mortality or morbidity rates) it is more meaningful to compare age/sex specific rates using one or more age groups of a designated sex (e.g. lung cancer in males aged 55-64 years). More complex calculations, which take account of the age and sex structure of a population as a whole, can produce standardized rates and standardized mortality ratios (SMR).
