- n. A paradox of intransitive preferences arising from the aggregation of individual transitive preferences under majority rule. Its simplest manifestation is in a group of three voters choosing among three alternatives $x, y$, and $z$, the first voter preferring the three alternatives in the order $x y z$, the second $y z x$, and the third $z x y$. In a majority vote, $x$ is preferred to $y$ by a majority of two to one (the first and third voters preferring the alternatives in that order), and similarly $y$ is preferred to $z$ by a majority, and $z$ is preferred to $x$ by a majority. Also called a cyclic majority or the paradox of voting. See also Arrow's impossibility theorem. \[Named after the French philosopher and mathematician Marie Jean Antoine Nicolas de Caritat Condorcet (1743-94) who discovered it in 1785]
