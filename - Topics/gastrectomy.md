- $n$. a surgical operation in which the whole or a part of the stomach is removed. Total gastrectomy, in which the oesophagus is joined to the jejunum, is usually performed for stomach cancer but occasionally for the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. In partial (or subtotal) gastrectomy the upper part of the stomach is joined to the duodenum or small intestine (gastroenterostomy); this operation (with vagotomy) was the definitive treatment for refractory peptic ulcer before the advent of antisecretory drugs. It is still performed in the treatment of gastric antral disease. After gastrectomy capacity for food is reduced, sometimes leading to weight loss. Other complications of gastrectomy include dumping syndrome, ulceration at the anastomosis, anaemia, and malabsorption.
