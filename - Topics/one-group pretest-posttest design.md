- $n$. One of the most frequently used quasi-experimental research designs in which a single group of research participants or subjects is pretested, given some treatment or independent variable manipulation, then posttested. If the pretest and posttest scores differ significantly, then the difference may be attributed to the independent variable, but because the research design is not strictly experimental and there is no control group, this inference is uncertain, and the difference may be due to extraneous variables such as order effects or regression towards the mean. See also interRUPTED TIME-SERIES DESIGN, NON-EQUIVALENT GROUPS DESIGN.
