- (TSE) The principal stock exchange of Japan, which is currently the third largest in the world by market capitalization. There are three sections. The first lists some 1,900 of the largest issues in the market. The second section has around 500 stocks, with less stringent listing requirements, while the third section is for new high-growth companies (currently about 200). Electronic trading for all transactions was introduced in 2000. TSE members are either regulars, who deal in securities as principals, or agents (saitori), who can only act as intermediaries between regular members. The main market indicator is the Nikkei Stock Average of 225 Japanese industrial companies. In 2013 the TSE merged with the Osaka Securities Exchange to form the Japan Exchange Group (JPX).
