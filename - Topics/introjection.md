## Source[^2]
- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a defence mechanism whereby an instinctual object is symbolically, or in fantasy, absorbed by a person, or instinctual energy is turned inward, as when a depressed person turns aggression back on the self. The term was introduced in 1909 by the Hungarian psychoanalyst Sandor Ferenczi (1873-1933) in an article entitled 'Introjection and Transference', where he contrasts it with projection (1): 'Whereas the paranoiac expels from his ego the impulses that have become unpleasant, the neurotic helps himself by taking into the ego as large as possible a part of the outside world, making it the object of unconscious phantasies' (First Contributions to Psycho-Analysis, 1952, p. 43). See also IDENTIFICATION (2), INCORPORATION, INTERNALIZATION.
