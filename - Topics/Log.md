- A log, commonly referred to as a log file, is a data file that automatically records and tracks the computing events, including transactions, intrusions, and errors, of an operating system, a computing device, a server, or a software tool. A log file has three basic elements: timestamp, user information, and event information. The timestamp records the exact time a computing event occurred, and the event information details what action was taken. Log files allow IT teams to track activities running behind the scenes of a computing system. These files are often used to diagnose computer issues or for auditing purposes.
