- CSU is a telecommunications term that refers to the device at the end of a T-carrier line. It terminates data transmission from one network, converts it into electrical signals for passage over fiber optic or copper wires, and then re-transmits the signal to another network. CSUs can be used in conjunction with DSU (Data Service Units)
