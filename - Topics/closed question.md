- $n$. A question to which an answer must be selected from a limited set. Questionnaire items with fixed response categories are closed questions, and questions in interviews or informal conversations can be open or closed. Are you angry about that? is a closed question, because it implies a yes/no answer, whereas How do you feel about that? is an open-ended question, because the range of possible answers is unlimited. Open-ended questions are more effective in breaking the ice or drawing out responses in tense or awkward social situations. Also called a close-ended question.
