- $n$. the alleged 'science' concerned with the improvement of the human race by means of the principles of genetics, strongly associated with ideas of selective breeding, discrimination, and immoral regimes, such as the Nazis in 20th-century Germany. Interventions used in reproductive medicine, such as preimplantation genetic diagnosis, antenatal screening, diagnostic testing, and abortion, are regarded by some as potentially eugenic. â€”eugenic adj.
## Source[^2]
- The study of methods of improving the quality of human populations by the application of genetic principles. Positive eugenics would seek to do this by selective breeding programmes, a strategy that is generally deemed reprehensible. Negative eugenics aims to eliminate harmful genes (e.g. those causing haemophilia and color blindness) by counselling any prospective parents who are likely to be carriers.
