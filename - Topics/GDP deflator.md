- The factor by which the value of GDP (see GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT) at current prices must be reduced (deflated) to express GDP in terms of the prices of some base year (e.g. 2000). The GDP deflator is thus a measure of inflation.
## Source[^2]
- A price index used to assess whether there has been a real rise or fall in gross domestic product (GDP) from one year to another. GDP at current prices is divided by the GDP deflator to obtain an index of GDP at base-year prices. A GDP deflator is based on a broader class of goods than the retail price index (RPI), since it needs to take account of the prices of investment goods and goods bought by the public sector as well as consumer goods prices.
