- Describing a body of water, such as a lake, that contains large amounts of undecomposed organic matter derived from terrestrial plants. Dystrophic lakes are poor in dissolved nutrients and therefore unproductive; they are common in peat areas and may develop into peat bogs. Compare EUTROPHIC; MESOTROPHIC; OLIGOTROPHIC.
