- Data definition language (DDL) is a computer programming language used to alter and modify data within a database. In particular, DDL consists of commands that can modify structures, tables, and other organizational formats. “Create,” “truncate,” “alter,” and “drop” are the most frequently used DDL commands, and are typically associated with modifying tables in a database.
