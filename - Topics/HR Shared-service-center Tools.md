- HR shared-service-center tools are software applications that help companies provide human resource (HR) services to their employees. HR shared-service centers are designed to be more efficient than decentralized models by allowing fewer HR professionals to serve a greater number of employees and managers. These solutions are frequently used to handle essential employee data such as performance or medical information. These technologies often connect to core HR management system (HRMS) systems.
