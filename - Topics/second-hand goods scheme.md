- An arrangement in which the value added tax due on second-hand goods sold is calculated on the trader's margin, rather than the total selling price of the goods. This applies regularly with sales of second-hand cars. In order to qualify, the trader must retain detailed records of car purchases and sales, which must be available for inspection at a VAT control visit.
