- $n$. The validity of a test determined by its correlation with a factor (2) determined by factor analysis. The idea behind this form of validity was introduced by the English statistician and psychologist Charles Spearman (1863-1945) in an article in the American Journal of Psychology in 1904, where he interpreted intelligence as the factor $g$ that underlies all test items and subtests with good content validity (that is, items and subtests that appear to require intelligence) and argued that the most valid tests are those with highest loadings on the factor $g$.
