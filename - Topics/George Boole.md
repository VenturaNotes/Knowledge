- (1815-64) British mathematician. Largely self-taught in mathematics, Boole began to publish a series of original in influential papers in 1839. In 1849 he became professor of mathematics at Queen's (now University) College, Cork, despite having no degree himself. From the perspective of computer science, his most important work was his innovative algebraic treatment of logic, first presented in his pamphlet 'Mathematical Analysis of Logic' (1847) and subsequently elaborated in An Investigation into the Laws of Thought, on Which Are Founded the Mathematical Theories of Logic and Probabilities (1854). This system, in which symbols representing logical values are manipulated by operators according to the principles of logic, is now called Boolean algebra and is fundamental to the operation of computers.
