- The risk that either of the parties to a contract (counterparties) will fail to honour their obligations under the contract. In organized markets this risk is reduced by the clearing house becoming counterparty to the contract, i.e. the buyer contracts to buy from the clearing house and the seller contracts to sell to the clearing house (see NOVATION). Traditionally, the risk has been much, greater in over-the-counter transactions, although recent years have seen new requirements for such trades to be cleared via a regulated platform.
