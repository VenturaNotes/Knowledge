- An operation on logical values, producing a Boolean result (see also Boolean algebra). The operations may be monadic or dyadic, and are denoted by symbols known as operators. In general there are 16 logic operations over one or two operands; they include AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, exclusive-OR, and equivalence.
- Logic operations involving more than two operands can always be expressed in terms of operations involving one or two operands. Those involving two operands can be expressed in terms of other operations involving one or two operands.
- Logic circuits are fabricated for the implementation of logic operations on their input signals. The inputs may be words (or bytes), and the logic operation is applied to each bit in accordance with Boolean algebra.
