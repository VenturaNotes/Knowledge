- (capital gearing; equity gearing; financial gearing; leverage) The relative size of the funds provided to a company by its ordinary shareholders and the long-term funds with a fixed interest charge, such as debentures and preference shares. A company is said to be high geared when its fixed interest capital is dominant and low geared when its capital is predominantly in ordinary shares, especially in relation to other similar companies. A high-geared company is considered to be a speculative investment for the ordinary shareholder and will be expected to show good returns when the company is doing well. See also DEBT-EQUITY RATIO; FINANCIAL DISTRESS.

- The ratio of a company's debt to its equity. High gearing means high reliance on debt financing. This is risky for the shareholders, as debt service absorbs a large proportion of profits in a normal year, and in a bad year the cost of debt service may exceed total profits. This could lead to dividends being reduced or passed, and possibly to loss of control of the company to creditors or debenture holders. The US term for gearing is leverage.
