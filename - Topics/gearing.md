- (capital gearing; equity gearing; financial gearing; leverage) The relative size of the funds provided to a company by its ordinary shareholders and the long-term funds with a fixed interest charge, such as debentures and preference shares. A company is said to be high geared when its fixed interest capital is dominant and low geared when its capital is predominantly in ordinary shares, especially in relation to other similar companies. A high-geared company is considered to be a speculative investment for the ordinary shareholder and will be expected to show good returns when the company is doing well. See also DEBT-EQUITY RATIO; FINANCIAL DISTRESS.
