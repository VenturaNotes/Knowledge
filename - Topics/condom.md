- $n$. a sheath made of latex rubber, plastic, or silk that is fitted over the penis during sexual intercourse. Use of a condom protects both partners against sexually transmitted diseases (including AIDS) and, carefully used, it is a reasonably reliable contraceptive (between 2 and 10 pregnancies per 100 woman-years). A more recent development is the female condom (e.g. Femidom), which is fitted into the vagina. Manufactured from similar materials as male condoms, they too act as both contraceptives and as barriers to sexually transmitted diseases.
