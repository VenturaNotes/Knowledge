- a technique for demonstrating an abnormal blood supply to an organ by injecting a radioactive tracer or contrast medium. One of the most common uses, often in conjunction with ventilation scanning (see VENTILATION-PERFUSION SCANNING), is to detect obstruction of pulmonary arteries due to embolism by thrombus (see PULMONARY EMBOLISM). Particles labelled with radioactive tracer are injected intravenously and become temporarily lodged in the capillaries in the lungs. Areas not being perfused show up as holes on the gamma-camera images. In magnetic resonance imaging or computerized tomography, contrast medium is injected and a series of images is obtained. The rate of change of enhancement is an index of the blood supply to the area of interest. This technique can be used to study blood supply to the brain, heart, or kidneys (in particular), to help diagnose arterial strictures or blockages, or tumours in which blood supply may be increased by abnormal vessels.
