- Equations that have the same general form as recurrence relations; however, the term also refers to situations in which the solution is not determined recursively from initial conditions. Difference equations play a large part in numerical computation. The equations are sometimes expressed in terms of differences of function values rather than function values themselves. The standard difference representations are:
- forward difference,$$\Delta f(x)=f(x+h)-f(x)$$
- backward difference,$$\Delta f(x)=f(x)-f(x-h)$$
- central difference,$$\delta f(x)=f(x+1 / 2 h)-f(x-1 / 2 h)$$
- Difference equations arise in the application of the finite-difference method.
