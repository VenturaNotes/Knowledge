- $n$. the outer and shorter bone of the forearm (compare ULNA). It partially revolves about the ulna, permitting pronation and supination of the hand. The head of the radius articulates with the humerus. The lower end articulates both with the scaphoid and lunate bones of the carpus (wrist) and with the ulna (via the ulnar notch on the side of the bone). $\textemdash$radial adj.

- (pl. radiuses or radii) (in anatomy) The smaller of the two bones in the lower section of the forelimb of a tetrapod vertebrate (compare ULNA). The radius articulates with some carpal bones and the ulna at the wrist and with the humerus at the elbow. This sophisticated articulation of the radius enables humans (and some other animals) to twist the forearm (see PRONATION; SUPINATION).
