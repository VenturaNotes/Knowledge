- $n$. A mental image or memory that is extraordinarily clear and vivid, as though actually being perceived, a significant minority of children and a much smaller proportion of adults being capable of such imagery, according to some authorities. More specifically, it is a clear and vivid visual image representing a previously perceived stimulus, persisting for more than a few seconds and often for several or many minutes, appearing to be located in front of the eyes. It is distinguished from an afterimage, which does not have these properties. \[From Greek eidetikos belonging to a (visual) image, from eidos form + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
