- A gamble with an expected pay-off of zero. For example, consider a gamble that involves winning $£ 2$ with probability $1 / 3$ and losing $£ 1$ with probability $2 / 3$. The expected pay-off is $(1 / 3) 2-(2 / 3) 1=0$. A fair gamble is said to have actuarially fair odds. Someone who is strictly risk-averse will not accept a fair gamble.
