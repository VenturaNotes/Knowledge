- The criteria that distinguish trading from investment for taxation purposes. Whereas six badges of trade were set out by the Royal Commission on the Taxation of Profits and Income in 1954, a total of nine such badges was identified in the important case Rosemoore Investments $v$ Inspector of Taxes (2002). Dealing on the commodity markets is normally regarded as trading and profits are subject to income tax or corporation tax; dealing on security markets is often (but not always) treated as investment and profits are subject to capital gains tax. The manner in which a capital gain is calculated frequently, but not invariably, gives a lower tax charge.
