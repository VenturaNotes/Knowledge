## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to a specific amino acid residue of an intracellular protein (usually serine, threonine, or tyrosine), thereby affecting the biological activity of the protein. Protein kinase inhibitors are drugs that block the action of protein kinases in tumour cells and are used in the treatment of cancer. They include sorafenib, sunitinib, and temsirolimus. See also TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITOR.

- An enzyme that catalyses the transfer of a phosphate group from ATP to an intracellular protein, thereby affecting the biological activity of the protein (see KINASE). Protein kinases phosphorylate specific amino-acid residues of their target proteins, usually either serine, threonine, or tyrosine. They play an important role in increasing or decreasing enzyme activity and in transmitting signals from receptors on the cell surface (see SIGNAL transduction). The activity of the protein kinases is itself controlled by cyclic AMP, calcium ions, or other intracellular chemicals. It can be reversed by the action of phosphatase enzymes in the cell.
