- (GFR) the rate at which substances are filtered from the blood of the glomeruli into the Bowman's capsules of the nephrons. It is calculated by measuring the clearance of specific substances (e.g. creatinine) and is an index of renal function. See EGFR.
## Source[^2]
- (GFR) The volume of fluid (see Glomerular filtrate) that is filtered from the capillaries of the glomeruli into the kidney tubules per unit time. It is influenced chiefly by blood pressure and by changes in the diameter of arterioles in the glomeruli. In humans average GFR values vary with age and range from about 116 $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min} / 1.73 \mathrm{~m}^{2}$ in people aged $20\textendash29$ to 60 in those aged $70+$. Some $99 \%$ of this filtered volume is reabsorbed as it passes along the kidney tubules to form urine. The GFR is usually estimated by measuring the creatine concentration in a blood sample. This is then combined with other factors such as age, gender, height, weight, and ethnicity to give an estimate of GFR.
