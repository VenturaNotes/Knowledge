- A univariate time series model, in the most general form given by$$\Delta^{d} y_{t}=\mu+\gamma_{1} \Delta^{d} y_{t-1}+\ldots+\gamma_{p} \Delta^{d} y_{t-p}+\varepsilon_{t}-\theta_{1} \varepsilon_{t-1}-\ldots-\theta_{q} \varepsilon_{t-q}$$where $\Delta^{d} y_{t}$ is the $d$th difference of $y_{t}$. This is a generalization of the autoregressive moving average (ARMA $(p, q)$) model used to describe a non-stationary process that becomes stationary after being differenced $d$ times. When $d$ is a fraction the process is sometimes referred to as an autoregressive fractionally integrated moving average, or ARFIMA process.
