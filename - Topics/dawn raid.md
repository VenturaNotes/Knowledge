- A move without notice by one firm to buy a substantial number of shares in another firm. Most stock exchanges impose a limit on the number of shares that can be bought without giving notice of a takeover bid; a dawn raid is often the prelude to a formal bid.

- An attempt by one company or investor to acquire a significant holding in the equity of another company by instructing brokers to buy all the shares available in that company as soon as the stock exchange opens, usually before the target company knows that it is, in fact, a target. The dawn raid may provide a significant stake from which to launch a takeover bid. The conduct of dawn raids is now restricted by the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers.
