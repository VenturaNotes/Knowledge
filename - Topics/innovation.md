- Any new approach to designing, producing, or marketing goods or services that creates value and gives the innovating company an advantage over competitors. In business literature, innovation is often distinguished from invention: while the latter involves coming up with a new idea or insight, and is usually the product of individual ingenuity, innovation involves bringing a new idea into practical effect, and is more often achieved within the organization. The restructuring of an organization or its processes to achieve significant improvements can be an important form of innovation. In economic theory, innovation is seen as a driver of Schumpeterian growth (see also CREATIVE DESTRUCTION) and is recognized as a key concept in the knowledge triangle. See DISCONTINUOUS INNOVATION; DYNAMICALLY CONTINUOUS INNOVATION.

- The economic application of a new idea. Product innovation involves a new or modified product; process innovation involves a new or modified way of making a product.
