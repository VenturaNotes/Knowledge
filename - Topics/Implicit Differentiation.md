- When $x$ and $y$ satisfy a single equation, it may be possible to regard this as defining $y$ as a function of $x$ with a suitable domain(see implicit function theorem). Implicit differentiation involves applying the chain rule to obtain the derivative of $y$ in such cases. For example, if $xy^2+x^2y^3-1=0,$ then $$2xy\frac{dy}{dx}+y^2+3x^2y^2\frac{dy}{dx}+2xy^3=0$$and so, if $2xy + 3x^2y^2 \ne 0$, $$\frac{dy}{dx}=-\frac{y^2+2xy^3}{2xy+3x^2y^2}.$$
