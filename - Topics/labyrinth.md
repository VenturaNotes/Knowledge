The membranous labyrinth is a series of interconnected membranous canals and chambers consisting of the semicircular canals, utricle, and saccule (concerned with balance) and the central cavity of the cochlea (concerned with hearing). (See illustration.) It is filled with a fluid, endolymph. The bony labyrinth is the system of the bony canals and chambers that surround the membranous labyrinth. It is embedded in the petrous part of the temporal bone and is filled with fluid (perilymph).
