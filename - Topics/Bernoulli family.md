- A family from Basel that produced a stream of significant mathematicians. The best known are the brothers Jacques (or James or Jakob) and Jean (or John or Johann), and Jean's son Daniel. Jacques Bernoulli (1654-1705) did much work on the newly developed calculus but is chiefly remembered for his contributions to probability theory: his Ars conjectandi was published posthumously in 1713. The work of Jean Bernoulli (1667-1748) was more definitely within calculus: he discovered l'HÃ´pital's rule and proposed the brachistochrone problem. He was one of the founders of the calculus of variations. In the next generation, the work of Daniel Bernoulli (1700-82) was mainly in hydrodynamics.
