- $n$. A figure of speech in which a single idea is expressed by two words, usually nouns, connected by and, instead of an adjective and a noun. It is used for rhetorical emphasis, as in the phrase wind and weather, which does not denote two separate ideas but one (windy weather). \[From Greek hen one + dia through + dis twice, from dyoin two]
