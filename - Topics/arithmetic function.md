- (number-theoretic function) Arithmetic functions are common and important in number theory. At their most general, arithmetic functions may be defined as real- or complex-valued functions defined for positive integers. Commonly such functions will also be assumed to be multiplicative in the sense that $f(m n)=f(m) f(n)$ when $m$ and $n$ are coprime. See DIVISOR FUNCTION, MÃ¶bius FUNCTION, SIGMA FUNCTION, TOTIENT FUNCTION.
