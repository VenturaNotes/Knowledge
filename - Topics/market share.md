- The share of the total sales of all brands or products competing in the same market that is captured by one particular brand or product, usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if brands A, B, and C are the competing brands of a product and in a particular month they achieved sales of $£ 480,000, £ 620,000$, and $£ 900,000$, respectively, brand A's market share would be$$\begin{gathered}(480,000 /(480,000+620,000+900,000)) \\\times 100=24 \%.\end{gathered}$$
