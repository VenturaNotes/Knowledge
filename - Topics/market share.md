- The share of the total sales of all brands or products competing in the same market that is captured by one particular brand or product, usually expressed as a percentage. For example, if brands A, B, and C are the competing brands of a product and in a particular month they achieved sales of $£ 480,000, £ 620,000$, and $£ 900,000$, respectively, brand A's market share would be$$\begin{gathered}(480,000 /(480,000+620,000+900,000)) \\\times 100=24 \%.\end{gathered}$$
## Source[^2]
- The share of a market held by a particular firm. The size of this depends largely on the definition of the market: a firm with a small share of a market broadly defined in geographical and industrial terms may have a much larger share of its local market, or the market for a more narrowly defined type of product. This point may be important if monopoly legislation uses market share as a basis for decisions. For example, reference to the Competition and Markets Authority in the UK depends on market share.
