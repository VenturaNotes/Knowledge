- $n$. Changes in genes other than changes in their DNA sequences, including additions of methyl groups to the DNA backbone and changes caused by the activity of regulator genes binding to gene operators. Epigenetic changes caused by environmental factors are preserved when cells divide, and can sometimes be inherited by offspring. The best known example of epigenetics is the differentiation of a single fertilized cell after conception to form cells of different types, including neurons, blood cells, skin cells, and muscle cells. See also epigenotype, GENETIC IMPRINTING. epigenetic adj. epigenome $n$. The full epigenetic environment of a cell. epigenomics $n$. The study of epigenetic effects on cells. \[Coined by the English geneticist Conrad Hal Waddington (1905-75) in an article entitled 'The Epigenotype' in the magazine Endeavour in 1941, from Greek epi on + genesis birth + -itikos resembling or marked by]
