- High interest rates, which make it expensive to borrow. How high rates need be to constitute dear money depends on the rate of inflation: only interest rates greater than the rate of inflation make borrowing expensive in real terms. If the central bank is using monetary policy to reduce aggregate demand, dear money and tight money, or difficulty in gaining credit, tend to go together.
