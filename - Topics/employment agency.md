- An organization that introduces suitable potential employees to employers, charging the employer a fee, usually related to the initial salary, for the service. Employment agencies also provide temporary staff, in which they are the employers, the temporary staff member being charged out at an hourly rate. Employment agencies that specialize in finding suitable managers and executives for a firm, or finding suitable jobs for executives who want a change, are often known as head hunters. Such agencies will often provide a short list of candidates in order to save their client's time in personnel selection. Employment agencies run by the government are called job centres.
