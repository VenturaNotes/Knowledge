- (CIT) An analytical technique used to identify those factors that are critical to the success or failure of individuals or systems in a given setting. People with first-hand experience (e.g. factory supervisors) are asked to describe incidents in which behavioral or other factors had a critical effect. These findings are then collated and analysed. The technique has mainly been used to devise rating scales for employee evaluation (see BEHAVIORALLY ANCHORED RATING SCALES; BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATION SCALE) but is also used in accident analysis, analysis of customer complaints, and various other applications.
