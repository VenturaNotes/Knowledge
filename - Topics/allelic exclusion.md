## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The mechanism by which a diploid cell expresses only one of the alleles of a particular gene, and so synthesizes just one of the possible protein variants. It occurs in certain cells of the immune system. For example, mature B cells belonging to a particular clone all produce identical antibodies, despite the presence in each cell of several genes determining antibody structure.
