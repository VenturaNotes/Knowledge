- Security through obsolescence is the method of using a dated operating system on a device to prevent hackers from intruding. This method might be seen as counterintuitive in the software development world, where new security patches are released with new and improved operating systems. However, if the goal of an individual or organization is to keep hackers out, holding out on updating to a new operating system can be a very effective way to do so.
