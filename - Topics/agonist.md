## Source[^3]
- $n$. 1. (prime mover) a muscle whose active contraction causes movement of a part of the body. Contraction of an agonist is associated with relaxation of its antagonist. 2. a drug or other substance that acts at a cellreceptor site to produce an effect that is the same as, or similar to, that of the body's normal chemical messenger. Sympathomimetic drugs (alpha agonists and beta agonists) are examples.
