- $n$. the study of how genes affect the actions of drugs. The enormous growth of knowledge about the human genome, arising from the Human Genome Project, has revolutionized drug treatment, enabling the precise targeting of drugs against the products of specific mutations causing disease (see TARGETED AGENT). In addition, it will be possible to identify those genetic variations that affect how drugs are metabolized in the body and their potential for causing adverse effects. Thus analysis of genetic data from individuals will enable safer and more effective treatment.
