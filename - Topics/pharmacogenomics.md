- $n$. the study of how genes affect the actions of drugs. The enormous growth of knowledge about the human genome, arising from the Human Genome Project, has revolutionized drug treatment, enabling the precise targeting of drugs against the products of specific mutations causing disease (see TARGETED AGENT). In addition, it will be possible to identify those genetic variations that affect how drugs are metabolized in the body and their potential for causing adverse effects. Thus analysis of genetic data from individuals will enable safer and more effective treatment.

- (pharmacogenetics) The study of how genes affect the actions of drugs. The enormous growth in knowledge about human genetics arising from the Human Genome Project, coupled with the rapid advance of computer systems to analyse the vast amounts of data, has revolutionized drug discovery and development. This approach, which combines genomics and pharmacology, improves understanding of drug actions, suggests new potential drug molecules, and enables computer-based searches for likely drug targets. In addition, analysis of genetic data from individuals raises the prospect of drugs being tailor-made to suit the genetic make-up of particular patients or groups of patients. This more precise targeting of drugs should make drugs more effective, with less risk of adverse side effects.
