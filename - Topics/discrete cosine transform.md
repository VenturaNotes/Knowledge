- A mathematical operation that analyses an arbitrary waveform into a summation of cosine functions:

  

$$

C(u)=\sqrt{ } /(2 / N) \sum_{n=0}^{N-1} f(x) \cos \{(2 x+1) u \pi\} / 2 N

$$

  

where the waveform $f(x)$ is approximated by $N$ samples at $x=0,1, \ldots N-1$.

Discrete cosine transforms find application in image-compression techniques, for example in JPEG.
