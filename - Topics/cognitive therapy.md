## Source [^1]
- a form of psychotherapy based on the belief that psychological problems are the products of faulty ways of thinking about the world. For example, a depressed patient may use wrongly negative automatic associations in everyday situations. The therapist assists the patient to identify these false ways of thinking and to avoid them. In cognitive behavioral therapy this is combined with an analysis and retraining of unhelpful behaviors. In cognitive analytical therapy (CAT) there is an element of psychodynamic exploration of the patient's problems; CAT is mostly used to treat personality disorders.
