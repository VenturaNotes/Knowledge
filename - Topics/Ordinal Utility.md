- When economists measure or rank the preferences of consumers, it is referred to as ordinal utility
## Source[^2]
- A utility function is ordinal if it can be subjected to any positive strictly monotonic transformation without altering the preferences it represents. Consider the preferences of a consumer depicted by a set of indifference curves. A utility function that represents these preferences can be constructed by assigning a number to each curve, with the numbers having the property that if $x$ is preferred to $y$ then the indifference curve on which $x$ lies is assigned a higher number than the indifference curve on which $y$ lies. The constructed utility function is ordinal. The numbers assigned to the indifference curve can be transformed in any way provided that the ranking of the numbers is retained: if one indifference curve has a higher number before the transformation it must have a higher number after the transformation. Ordinal utility conveys no more information than that contained in the indifference curves. The observation that the utility from choice $x$ is greater than the utility from choice $y$ means only that $x$ lies on a higher indifference curve than $y$.
