## Source [^1]
- (myohaemoglobin) $n$. an iron-containing protein, resembling haemoglobin, found in muscle cells. Like haemoglobin it contains a haem group, which binds reversibly with oxygen, and so acts as an oxygen reservoir within the muscle fibres.
## Source[^2]
- A globular protein occurring widely in muscle tissue as an oxygen carrier, especially in muscles containing slow-twitch fibers. It comprises a single polypeptide chain and a haem group, which reversibly binds a molecule of oxygen. This is only relinquished at relatively low external oxygen concentrations, e.g. during strenuous exercise when muscle oxygen demand outpaces supply from the blood. Myoglobin thus acts as an emergency oxygen store. It occurs in high concentrations in the muscles of diving mammals such as seals.

Myoglobin thus acts as an emergency oxygen store. It was the first protein to have its structure worked out.
