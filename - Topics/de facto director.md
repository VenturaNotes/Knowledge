- A person who is not legally or formally appointed as a director of a company but may be regarded as such as a matter of fact, because he or she is allowed to occupy the position of director or assumes the responsibilities of a director. Such a person owes the same fiduciary duties to a company as a de jure director. Compare SHADOW DIRECTOR.
