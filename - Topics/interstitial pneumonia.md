- (interstitial pneumonitis) an alternative name for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis used by lung pathologists to classify the different cellular types of the disease. The most common cellular pattern is usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). A differing cellular pattern is seen in patients with nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (NSIP), who have a better prognosis than those with UIP. There are two variants of NSIP: cellular and fibrosing. The former has chronic inflammatory cells with minimal collagen deposition, while the latter consists of diffuse interstitial fibrosis with fewer inflammatory cells. It is believed that corticosteroid therapy can slow the progression of cellular to fibrosing NSIP.
