- In the computer technology industry, the verb mount is used to define the act of attaching an external storage device such as a hard drive, USB flash drive, or blank disk to a computer system. Mounting a storage device to a computer system allows a computer user to access the files and folders that reside on the mounted device. Local mounts connect to the disk drive on a computer to access the data that resides on an external storage device. Remote mounts use a network file system (NFS) to connect the data directories that reside on other computer systems to a computer user's file system. Businesses often use the mounting process to access data from or transfer data to an external storage device.
