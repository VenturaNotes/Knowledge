- (Cryptophyta) A phylum of unicellular eukaryotic organisms with flattened ovoid cells and two flagella arising from an obliquely situated gullet (crypt). Cryptomonads include freshwater and marine algae, which contain chlorophyll and phycobiliprotein photosynthetic pigments; and heterotrophic protozoa, which may be carnivorous or parasitic (in animal intestines). They are placed in the eukaryotic assemblage called stramenopiles.
