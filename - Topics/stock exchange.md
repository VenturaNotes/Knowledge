- (stock market) A market in which securities are bought and sold, prices being controlled by supply and demand. Stock markets have developed hand in hand with capitalism since the 17th century, constantly growing in importance and complexity. The basic function of a stock exchange is to enable public companies, governments, and local authorities to raise capital by selling securities to investors. The secondary market function of a stock exchange is to enable these investors to sell their securities to others, providing liquidity and reducing the risks attached to investment. Most countries now have stock exchanges. The major international stock exchanges are based in New York, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, and Shanghai.
