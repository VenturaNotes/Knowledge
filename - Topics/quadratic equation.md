- A quadratic equation in the unknown x is an equation of the form $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, where $a, b$ and $c$ are give real numbers, with $a \ne 0$. This may be solved by completing the square or by using the quadratic formula. $$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a},$$which is established by completing the square. The term $b^2-4ac$ is known as the discriminant. The equation has two distinct real roots, a repeated real root, or two complex conjugate roots, depending on whether the discriminant is positive, zero, or negative respectively
- If $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are the roots of the quadratic equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$, then $\alpha + \beta = -b/a$ and $\alpha \beta = c/a$. (See Vi√®te's Formulae.) The quadratic formula is still valid over other fields provided that the discriminant has a square root in the field
