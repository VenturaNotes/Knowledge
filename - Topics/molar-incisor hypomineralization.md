- a defect involving a deficiency in the mineralization of permanent first molar and incisor teeth during their maturation phase, thought to be due to a disturbance of development around the time of birth. It often presents in discolouration (yellow, brown, cream, or white depending on severity) and results in the affected teeth being more susceptible to decay.
