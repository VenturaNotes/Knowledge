- a section of the National Assistance Act 1948 that enables a local authority to arrange for the compulsory removal to a place of care of a person who is unwilling to go voluntarily from his or her own home. Individuals who are suffering from a grave chronic disease, or are physically incapacitated, or are living in insanitary conditions because of old age or infirmity can be removed if they are unable to care for themselves and do not receive care and attention from others. A public health consultant and another registered medical practitioner (usually the patient's general practitioner) must certify that removal is in the interests of the patient or that it would prevent injury to the health of, or serious nuisance to, other people.
