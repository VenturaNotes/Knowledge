- (PI) A method used in discounted cash flow for ranking a range of projects under consideration, in which standard cash flow patterns are projected. It is based on the ratio:$$\begin{align}&\text{total present values of cash inflows/} \\ &\text{initial investment,}\end{align}$$the value of which is compared for each project.
- The projects with a PI of less than 1 are not expected to earn the required rate of return and are rejected. The projects with a PI in excess of 1 are ranked according to the magnitude of the PI.
