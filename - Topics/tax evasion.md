- Minimizing tax liabilities illegally, usually by not disclosing that one is liable to tax or by giving false information to the authorities. If a person donates money to a bona fide charity in order to reduce his tax burden he is practising tax avoidance; if he informs the Revenue that he has made such donations when this is not the case, he is guilty of tax evasion. As Denis Healey once remarked, 'The difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is the thickness of a prison wall'.
