- Minimizing tax liabilities illegally, usually by not disclosing that one is liable to tax or by giving false information to the authorities. If a person donates money to a bona fide charity in order to reduce his tax burden he is practising tax avoidance; if he informs the Revenue that he has made such donations when this is not the case, he is guilty of tax evasion. As Denis Healey once remarked, 'The difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion is the thickness of a prison wall'.

- Failure to pay taxes legally due, for example by making a false tax return or failing to make a return at all. Tax evasion is thus illegal; it is contrasted with tax avoidance, which means arranging one's affairs to reduce the tax that is legally payable. An individual choosing whether to engage in tax evasion has to weigh the gains from reduced tax payment against the punishment if caught evading. This is a standard example of the economics of choice with risk.
