- A government policy of providing support for certain basic, usually agricultural, products to stop the price falling below an agreed level. Support prices can be administered in various ways: the government can purchase and stockpile surplus produce to support the price or it can pay producers a cash payment as a subsidy to raise the price they obtain through normal market channels. See also Common Agricultural Policy.

- Government policies to keep the producer prices of commodities above some minimum level. This applies mainly to agricultural products, to raise the incomes of producers. Price support works either by buying the product to prevent the market price from falling, or by paying the producer a subsidy to cover any shortfall of market price below the support price.
