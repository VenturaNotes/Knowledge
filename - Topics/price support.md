- A government policy of providing support for certain basic, usually agricultural, products to stop the price falling below an agreed level. Support prices can be administered in various ways: the government can purchase and stockpile surplus produce to support the price or it can pay producers a cash payment as a subsidy to raise the price they obtain through normal market channels. See also Common Agricultural Policy.
