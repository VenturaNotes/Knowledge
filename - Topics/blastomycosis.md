- $n$. any disease caused by parasitic fungi of the genus Blastomyces, which may affect the skin (forming wartlike ulcers and tumors on the face, neck, hands, arms, feet, and legs) or involve various internal tissues, such as the lungs, bones, liver, spleen, and lymphatics. There are two principal forms of the disease: North American blastomycosis (Gilchrist's disease), caused by B. dermatitidis; and South American blastomycosis, caused by B. brasiliensis. Both diseases are treated with antifungal drugs (such as amphotericin).
