- A neutral stain for blood smears devised by the British surgeon W. B. Leishman (1865-1926). It consists of a mixture of eosin (an acidic stain), and methylene blue (a basic stain) in alcohol and is usually diluted and buffered before use. It stains the different components of blood in a range of shades between red and blue. The similar Wright's stain is favoured by American workers.
