- $n$. A term introduced in 1915 by the Swiss linguist Ferdinand de Saussure (1857-1913) to denote the faculty of speech present in all human beings and acquired through heredity, which is divided into two major aspects, namely langue and parole, often said to correspond roughly to the competence (2) and performance (2) of the US linguist and philosopher (Avram) Noam Chomsky (born 1928), but there are important differences between langue and competence. \[Old French langage language, from Latin lingua the tongue]
