- (1) A programming or specification construct that defines a software component. Often a module is a unit of software that provides users with some data types and operations on those data types, and can be separately compiled. The module has an interface in the form of a heading that specifies the data types and operations the module provides its users. Mathematically, the syntax of the interface is a signature and the semantics of a module is a class of algebras of that signature. In some programming languages that provide modules, they are called by other names such as package, cluster, or object. The concept developed as a programming construct to support information hiding and abstract data types. The theory of program construction based on modules is a promising, but difficult, area of research. 
- (2) A component of a hardware system that can be subdivided.
