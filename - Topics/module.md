- (1) A programming or specification construct that defines a software component. Often a module is a unit of software that provides users with some data types and operations on those data types, and can be separately compiled. The module has an interface in the form of a heading that specifies the data types and operations the module provides its users. Mathematically, the syntax of the interface is a signature and the semantics of a module is a class of algebras of that signature. In some programming languages that provide modules, they are called by other names such as package, cluster, or object. The concept developed as a programming construct to support information hiding and abstract data types. The theory of program construction based on modules is a promising, but difficult, area of research. 
- (2) A component of a hardware system that can be subdivided.
## Source[^2]
- The term module refers to a piece of computer code that provides a specific functionality in a complex software program. For instance, software applications intended for business use, such as enterprise resource management (ERP) programs, typically contain various modules that each perform unique business functions. ERP solutions typically include finance and accounting, procurement, manufacturing, inventory management, order management, customer relationship management, human resource management, eCommerce, and marketing automation modules that help companies streamline their business operations.
