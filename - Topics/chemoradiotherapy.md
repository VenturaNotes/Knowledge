- $n$. the use of concurrent chemotherapy as a radiosensitizer and radical irradiation in the treatment of malignant disease. Combined treatment in this way offers higher response rates, particularly in some gastrointestinal malignancies, such as rectal cancer and (particularly) anal cancer. It is also of proven benefit in locally advanced squamous cancers, such as those arising from the head and neck region or the cervix of the uterus.
