- A color model that defines colors by the three parameters hue $(\mathrm{H})$, saturation (S), and value (V). The HSV color model is an inverted hexagonal cone with black at the apex $(V=0)$ and white at the center $(V=1)$ of the hexagonal base. The three primary (red, green, blue) and three secondary (cyan, magenta, yellow) hues are located at the vertices of the hexagon. See also HLS COLOR MODEL.
