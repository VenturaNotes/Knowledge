## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. the biochemical process in which glucose, an important source of energy, is synthesized from non-carbohydrate sources, such as amino acids. Gluconeogenesis occurs mainly in the liver and kidney and meets the needs of the body for glucose when carbohydrate is not available in sufficient amounts in the diet.
## Source[^2]
- The synthesis of glucose from noncarbohydrate sources, such as fat and protein. This occurs when the glycogen supplies in the liver are exhausted. The pathway is essentially a reversal of glycolysis from pyruvate to glucose and it can utilize many sources, including amino acids, glycerol, and Krebs cycle intermediates. Large-scale protein and fat catabolism normally occurs only in those suffering from starvation or certain endocrine disorders.
