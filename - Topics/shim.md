## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A code snippet enabling modern web features to function within older programming or browsing environments.

## Source[^2]
- A piece of code used to correct the behavior of code that already exists, usually by adding a new API that works around the problem.
- Differs from a [[polyfill]], which implements a new API that is not supported by the stock browser as shipped
	- Explanation[^3]
		- "Stock browser" refers to the default, unmodified version of a web browser as it is originally provided by the vendor (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) without any extensions, modifications, or custom patches
		- So polyfill provides functionality that the browser does not natively support in its default state
