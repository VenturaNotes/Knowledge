- $n$. A statistical test of association or goodness of fit (1) that is based on the likelihood ratio (1) and is thought by many statisticians to be preferable to the conventional Pearson chi-square test for the simultaneous analysis of several overlapping associations in a multiple-classification table, because under certain conditions it has the property of additivity of effects. The statistic, which is distributed like chisquare, is computed from the natural logarithms of observed and (in goodness of fit tests) expected frequencies. Compare Pearson Chi-Square TEST.
