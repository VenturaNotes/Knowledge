- $n$. an abnormal increase in the amount of cerebrospinal fluid within the ventricles of the brain. In childhood, before the sutures of the skull have fused, hydrocephalus makes the head enlarge. In adults, because of the unyielding nature of the skull, hydrocephalus raises the intracranial pressure with consequent drowsiness and vomiting. Hydrocephalus may be caused by obstruction to the outflow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the ventricles (obstructive hydrocephalus), a failure of its reabsorption into the cerebral sinuses, or increased production of CSF (communicating hydrocephalus). Spina bifida may be associated with hydrocephalus in childhood. Treatment involves treating the underlying cause and, if necessary, diverting the excess cerebrospinal fluid into the abdominal cavity, where it is absorbed. This is achieved by tunnelling a thin tube from the ventricles to the abdomen (ventriculoperitoneal shunt) or to the atrium of the heart (ventriculo-atrial shunt).
