- Any inactive enzyme precursor that, following secretion, is chemically altered to the active form of the enzyme. For example, the protein-digesting enzyme trypsin is secreted by the pancreas as the zymogen trypsinogen. This is changed in the small intestine by the action of another enzyme, enterokinase, to the active form.
