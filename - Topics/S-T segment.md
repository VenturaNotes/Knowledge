- the segment on an electrocardiogram that represents the interval between the end of ventricular depolarization (QRS complex) and the beginning of ventricular repolarization (T wave). The Sâ€“T segment is usually depressed by ischaemia of the heart muscle but raised in the initial phase of myocardial infarction. It is therefore very useful for diagnosis in patients presenting with chest pain.
