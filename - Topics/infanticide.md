- $n$. (in England and Wales) under the terms of the Infanticide Act 1938, the killing of an infant by the natural mother within 12 months of birth. Where it can be shown that the woman's balance of mind was disturbed due to childbirth and/or lactation she would not normally be charged with murder but with infanticide, which carries a much lighter sentence. As a result, it is uncommon for a mother who kills her infant child to receive a custodial sentence. Following a report from the Law Commission in 2006, there have been repeated calls for the law to be reformed so that a defence of diminished responsibility is automatically available in such cases.
