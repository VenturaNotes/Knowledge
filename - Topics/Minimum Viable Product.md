- A development technique in which a new product is developed with sufficient features to satisfy early adopters, with the final set of features only designed and developed after considering feedback from the productâ€™s initial users.
## Source[^2]
- Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is the first iteration and release of a new product, service, or feature. This release allows businesses to gather feedback about the product from customers and see how well it performs. Businesses can product an MVP with less time, effort, and funds than a finished product since the MVP will be used to inform and improve the final version.
