### Definition
- Largest whole number that is a divisor of all numbers

## Source[^2]
### Finding the GCD
- Find the prime factorization of each number
- Create a list of prime factors that are common to all numbers
- the GCD is the product of the numbers on the list

- For two non-zero integers $a$ and $b$, any integer that is a divisor of both is a common divisor. Of all the common divisors, the greatest common divisor (or gcd), denoted by (a, b) or gcd(a, b). The gcd of $a$ and $b$ has the property of being divisible by every other common divisor of $a$ and $b$. BÃ©zout's lemma states that there are integers $s$ and $t$ such that the gcd can be expressed as $sa + tb$. If the prime decompositions of $a$ and $b$ are known, the gcd is easily found: for example, if $a = 168 = 2^3*3*7$ and $b = 180=2^2*3^2*5$, then the gcd is $2^2*3 = 12$. Otherwise, the gcd can be found by the Euclidean Algorithm, which can also be used to find $s$ and $t$ to express the gcd as $sa+tb$. Similarly, any finite set of non-zero integers $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ has a gcd, denoted by $(a_1, a_2, ..., a_n)$, and there are integers $s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$ such that this can be expressed as $s_1a_1 + s_2a_2 + \cdots + s_na_n$
