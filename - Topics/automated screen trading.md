- Electronic dealing in securities or other financial instruments using visual-display units to display prices and the associated computer equipment to enter, match, and execute deals. The system does away with the need for face-to-face trading on a formal stock-exchange floor. It also reduces or eliminates paperwork. Many leading exchanges now operate entirely through automated screen trading, as do most alternative trading systems. Automated trading has been taken to another level in modern high-speed trading, in which trades are executed entirely by algorithm.
