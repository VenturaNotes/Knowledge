- $n$. Over-consciousness of one's own behavior, to the point that it interferes with sexual performance, social interaction, or other activities involving skills. The idea can be traced back to the ancient Sanskrit scriptures of the Vedanta, one of the philosophical schools of Hinduism, according to which the knower cannot be known, and the one that sees cannot be seen, but it was first investigated in clinical psychology by the Austrian psychiatrist Viktor E. Frankl (1905-97). It is countered by the therapeutic technique of de-reflection. See also CENTIPEDE EFFECT, Humphrey's law.
