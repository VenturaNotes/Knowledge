- Tizen is an open source Linux-based operating system mainly used by Samsung electronics. Samsung Tizen was one of the very first implementations of the operating system. This system is compatible with multiple electronic devices, such as smartphones, smart TVS, tablets, and wearable computers. This operating system provides the Samsung user the same digital experience across all devices. All Tizen apps are coded in HTML5. Due to their familiarity with HTML5, it is easy for most developers to build websites and apps on operating systems like Tizen. This loyal use of Tizen simplifies software production since the same code is used for all applications. This has encouraged other software companies to use Tizen or another operating system across all devices.
