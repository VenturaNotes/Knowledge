- $n$. damage to the skin by excessive exposure to the sun's rays, principally UVB (ultraviolet B), at wavelengths of 290-320 nm. Sunburn may vary from reddening of the skin to the development of large painful fluid-filled blisters, which may cause shock if they cover a large area (see BURN). Fair-skinned red-haired people (Fitzpatrick skin phototype I) are more susceptible to sunburn than others. Severe sunburn in childhood is a risk factor for the development of malignant melanoma and other skin tumours in later life.
