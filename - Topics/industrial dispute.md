- A disagreement between employees and employers concerning pay, hours of work, working conditions, manning levels, or job security. Industrial disputes may be settled by conciliation; by arbitration through some third party agreed on by both sides or prescribed by law; or by industrial action, including overtime bans, go-slows, or in the last resort strikes or lock-outs. The employees may be organized by trade unions; employers may negotiate separately or via employers' associations.
