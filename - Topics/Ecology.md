## Source[^3]
- The study of the interrelationships between organisms and their natural environment, both living and nonliving. For this purpose, ecologists study organisms in the context of the populations and communities in which they can be grouped and the ecosystems of which they form a part. The study of ecological interactions provides important information on the nature and mechanisms of evolutionary change. Advances in ecology have placed in harsh focus the effects of human activities on the environment (see POLLUTION) and have resulted in a greater awareness of the importance of conservation and the need to ensure that development is sustainable.
