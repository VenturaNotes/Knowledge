- A payment for the use of land, usually under a lease. The most usual kinds are ground rent and rack rent. Rack rent is paid when no capital payment (premium) has been made for the lease and the rent therefore represents the full value of the land and buildings. The amount of rent may be regulated by statute in certain cases. See also PEPPERCORN RENT.
