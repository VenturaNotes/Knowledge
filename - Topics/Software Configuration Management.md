- SCM is a change management process that tracks software changes and helps to ensure consistency across different applications. SCM is often used by companies that want to make sure that their software products are up-to-date with all of the latest security features, bug fixes, or other types of updates. SCM can also manage software licenses and keep track of which version each customer has installed on their system so that support issues don't arise when someone tries using an old version.
