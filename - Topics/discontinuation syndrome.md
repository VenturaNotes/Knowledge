- symptoms that arise from the sudden cessation of certain centrally acting drugs, such as antidepressants, beta blockers, and antihypertensives. Experiences include a rebound effect in which the original symptoms return but are temporarily worse than before, flulike symptoms and headaches, nausea, and giddiness that is usually short-lived and stops within 36 hours. This syndrome is not a sign of addiction and it does not indicate dependency.
