## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- YF, or potential output, represents the level of output an economy can produce when operating at full efficiency, utilizing all available resources optimally. 
- This concept is crucial for understanding the long-run [[aggregate supply]], as it indicates the economy's capacity to sustain production without triggering inflation, distinguishing between short-term fluctuations and long-term growth prospects.
## Source[^2]
- A measure of the productive capacity of an economy that can be defined as either the maximum output that is produced when all factors of production work at the rates consistent with stable inflation, or the output at the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. For both of these definitions actual output is able to exceed potential output, in which case the output gap is positive.
