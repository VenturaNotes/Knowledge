- The value that a sum of money (the present value) invested at compound interest will have in the future. If the future value is $F$, and the present value is $P$, at an annual rate of interest $r$, compounded annually for $n$ years, $F=P(1+r)^{n}$. Thus a sum with a present value of $£ 1,000$ will have a future value of $£ 1,973.82$ at $12 \%$ p.a., after six years.
