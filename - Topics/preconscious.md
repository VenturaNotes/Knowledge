## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- adj. n. In psychoanalysis, (of or relating to) mental contents that are not currently in consciousness but are accessible to consciousness by directing attention to them, such as memories that are not at present being recalled but that can be recalled at will. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) developed the theory of the preconscious early in his career and set it out fully in his book The Interpretation of Dreams (1900, Standard Edition, IV$\textendash$V). A barrier of censorship exists between the preconscious and the unconscious (2), and a second barrier exists between the preconscious and consciousness, though this second barrier differs from the first inasmuch as it selects more than it distorts. In 1920 Freud abandoned this topography in favor of the structural model of id-ego-superego. See also PERCEPTION-CONSCIOUSNESS SYSTEM, SUBCONSCIOUS (2), THING-PRESENTATION, WORD-PRESENTATION. pcs abbrev. (adj.), Pcs abbrev. (n.).
