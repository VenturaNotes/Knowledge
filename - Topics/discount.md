- A reduction in price. A cash discount or a discount for prompt payment is a reduction in price allowed to customers who pay cash, or pay promptly. A security stands at a discount if its present market price is below the price at which it is due to be redeemed. The present discounted value of payments due to be received at a future date is found by reducing them by a percentage per period, for each period by which the receipt is delayed. Discounting bills of exchange means buying at a reduced price the right to receive payment when it becomes due. See also CASH DISCOUNT; QUANTITY DISCOUNT.

- (1) A deduction from a bill of exchange when it is purchased before its maturity date. The party that purchases (discounts) the bill pays less than its face value and therefore makes a profit when it matures. The amount of the discount consists of interest calculated at the bill rate for the length of time that the bill has to run. See DISCOUNT MARKET. 
- (2) A reduction in the price of goods below list price, for buyers who pay cash (cash discount), for members of the trade (see TRADE DISCOUNT), for buying in bulk (bulk or quantity discount), for retailers who advertise a manufacturer's product (promotional discount), etc. 
- (3) The amount by which the market price of a security is below its par value. A $£ 100$ par value loan stock with a market price of $£ 95$ is said to be at a $5 \%$ discount. 
- (4) To convert a future value into a present value, as by the discounted cash flow method.
