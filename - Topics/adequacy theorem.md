- A theorem about a logical system $L$ and a semantics $S$ stating that if a formula is valid in the semantics $S$ then it is provable in the logic $L$. An adequacy theorem confirms that the logic can express and derive all properties that are valid according to the semantics. See also COMPLETENESS THEOREM.
