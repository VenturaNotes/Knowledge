- (TVR) The measurement of the popularity of a television programme based on survey research. Equipment attached to sets in selected homes records which channel the set is tuned to, while diary panels are used to determine how many people are watching the set. In this way ratings can be calculated for each programme and expressed as a percentage of the total households that can receive TV. Survey research is undertaken in the UK by the Broadcasters Audience Research Board (BARB).
