- A vote exercised by one person on behalf of another. At company meetings proxy votes are commonly allowed. Usually shareholders can nominate some other person to cast their vote, either in some specified manner or at the proxy-holder's discretion. It is common for proxies to be entrusted to the Chairman of a company meeting. In many cases the majority of votes cast are proxies, rather than those of shareholders attending a meeting.
