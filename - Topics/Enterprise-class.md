- Enterprise-class refers to a type of computer system that is designed for businesses. Enterprise-class systems typically have more processing power and memory than consumer-level systems, and they usually include disk array controllers, redundant power supplies, and hot-swappable hard drives. The difference between an enterprise-class system and a consumer-level system is that the enterprise-class system is designed to be used in a corporate environment. It can handle more applications and have more memory, storage, and CPU.
