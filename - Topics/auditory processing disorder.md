- (APD, central auditory processing disorder, CAPD) a series of conditions characterized by difficulty in hearing and processing auditory information, especially in poor acoustic environments, despite normal or near-normal ear function. It may be due to genetic factors, maturational delay in the central nervous system, or focal abnormalities of the central nervous system (such as tumours). Treatments include hearing therapy, auditory skills training, educational support, use of assistive listening devices, and training with computerized therapy tools.
