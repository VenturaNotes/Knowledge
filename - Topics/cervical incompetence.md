- spontaneous dilatation of the cervix of the uterus during the second trimester of pregnancy. The membranes bulge and subsequently rupture, and the fetus is expelled prematurely in a late miscarriage. It may be caused by forcible dilatation of the cervix during the operation of dilatation and curettage or it may be related to laceration of the cervix during a previous delivery or to previous cervical surgical procedures (e.g. knife cone biopsy).
