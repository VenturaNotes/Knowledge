- (trichiniasis) $n$. a disease of cold and temperate regions caused by the larvae of the nematode worm Trichinella spiralis. Humans contract trichinosis after eating imperfectly cooked meat infected with the parasite's larval cysts. Larvae, released by females in the intestine, penetrate the intestinal wall and cause diarrhoea and nausea. They migrate around the body and may cause fever, vertigo, delirium, and pains in the limbs. The larvae eventually settle within cysts in the muscles, and this may result in pain and stiffness. The intestinal phase of the disease is treated with anthelmintics.
