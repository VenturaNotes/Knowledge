- a hereditary disorder in which the presence of multiple polyps in the lining of the small intestine (intestinal polyposis) is associated with pigmented areas (similar to freckles) around the lips, on the inside of the mouth, and on the palms and soles. The polyps can also occur in the colon and stomach. They may bleed, resulting in anaemia, or may cause obstruction of the bowel. Half of the patients develop malignant tumours (not necessarily of the bowel). \[J. L. A. Peutz (1886-1957), Dutch physician; H. J. Jeghers (1904-90), US physician]
