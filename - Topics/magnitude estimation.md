- $n$. A scaling method used in psychophysics in which an observer assigns numbers to a variable stimulus according to its apparent intensity, often after being presented with a standard stimulus and told what number to assign to it, as when an observer is told that a standard light stimulus should be assigned a brightness rating of 10 and the variable stimulus should be assigned numbers in relation to it. See also Cross-MODAL MATCHING, DIRECT SCALING. Compare MAGNITUDE PRODUCTION.
