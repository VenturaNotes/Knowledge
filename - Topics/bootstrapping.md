- A process, due to Bradley Efron, of generating confidence intervals for statistics which has the advantage of not making assumptions about the underlying distribution of the population. It involves taking repeated random samples from the actual sample of observations which has been taken and producing confidence intervals for the statistic based on the distribution of the statistic in that process. Because it involves large numbers of repetitions of the resampling process it is dependent on computer power.
