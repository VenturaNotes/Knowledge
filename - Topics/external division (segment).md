- Let AB be a line segment. Then the point E is the external division of AB in the ratio 1:k if $k\overrightarrow{AE} = \overrightarrow {BE}$ where $\overrightarrow {AB}$ is the vector from A to B.
	- If A and B have position vectors $a$ and $b$, from some origin, then the position vector of $E$ is $$e = \frac{ka - b}{k-1},$$sometimes referred to as the section formula. Compare INTERNAL DIVISION
