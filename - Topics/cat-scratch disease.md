- an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Bartonella henselae, which infects cats and is transmitted to humans by a cat scratch or bite. A papule or pustule develops at the site of the injury followed, a week to two months after infection, by swelling of the lymph nodes (usually those closest to the wound). Fever and malaise are common. The condition usually resolves without treatment but antibiotics may be given to prevent complications.
