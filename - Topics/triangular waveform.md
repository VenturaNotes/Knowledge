- A periodic repetitive waveform that takes on its peak positive and negative excursions at fixed points in time. Between these peaks the waveform alternately rises and falls linearly with time. The rates of rise and fall determine the repetition rate or frequency of the waveform and in general are made equal. Compare SAWTOOTH WAVEFORM.
