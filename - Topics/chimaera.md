- An organism composed of tissues that are genetically different. Chimaeras can develop if a mutation occurs in a cell of a developing embryo. All the cells arising from it have the mutation and therefore produce tissue that is genetically different from adjacent tissue, e.g. brown patches in otherwise blue eyes in humans. Graft hybrids are examples of plant chimaeras.
