- A pulse that must be present to allow other signals to be effective in certain electronic logic circuits. Although the term is now used to describe an electronic logic function it was originally used in an analogous way in connection with core stores, where the coincidence of two pulses was required to change the state of a core: one of the pulses was the write pulse and could be common to a number of cores; an enable pulse was simultaneously applied to a particular core and thus enabled the write pulse to change the state of that core.
