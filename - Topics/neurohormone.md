- Any hormone that is produced not by an endocrine gland but by a specialized nerve cell and is secreted from nerve endings into the bloodstream or directly to the tissue or organ whose growth or function it controls (see NEUROSECRETION). Examples of neurohormones are noradrenaline, antidiuretic hormone, and hormones associated with metamorphosis and moulting in insects (see ECDYSONE; JUVENILE HORMONE). Compare NEUROPEPTIDE.
