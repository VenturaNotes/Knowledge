- (1) A device that can be attached to a computer in order to present transient images$\textemdash$textual or pictorial$\textemdash$on its screen (see TEXT MODE, GRAPHICS MODE). For many years the most widely used display device was the cathode-ray tube with color specified by RGB signals. Other display technologies use flat-panel displays, which in recent years have largely replaced cathode-ray tubes as prices have fallen. These include LCDs (liquid-crystal displays), plasma panels, and electroluminescent displays.
