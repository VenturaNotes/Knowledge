- $n$. breakage of a bone, either complete or incomplete. A simple fracture involves a clean break with little damage to surrounding tissues and no break in the overlying skin. If the overlying skin is perforated and there is a wound extending to the fracture site, the fracture is open, and there is a risk of infection (see osteomyelitis). Treatment of a simple fracture includes realignment of the bone ends where there is displacement, immobilization by external splints or internal fixation, followed by rehabilitation. See also Colles' fracture; Comminuted fracture; GREENSTICK FRACTURE; PATHOLOGICAL FRACTURE; SCAPHOID FRACTURE; SMITH's FRACTURE; STRESS FRACTURE.
