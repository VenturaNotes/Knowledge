- The two nuclei in the embryo sac of flowering plants that are closely associated with the oosphere, or egg cell, to form the egg apparatus. The synergids secrete signal molecules that diffuse through the style tissue and guide the developing pollen tube towards the embryo sac; they may also cause the tip of the pollen tube to burst, releasing the male gametes into the embryo sac.
