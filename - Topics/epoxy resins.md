## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Synthetic resins produced by copolymerizing epoxide compounds with phenols. They contain -O- linkages and epoxide groups and are usually viscous liquids. They can be hardened by addition of agents, such as polyamines, that form cross-linkages. Alternatively, catalysts may be used to induce further polymerization of the resin. Epoxy resins are used in electrical equipment and in the chemical industry (because of resistance to chemical attack). They are also used as adhesives.
