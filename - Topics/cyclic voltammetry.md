- In electrochemistry, a technique in which the current at an electrode is measured against the voltage each time the applied potential reaches a set value, with the potential being returned to its initial value after each measurement. The technique is used to investigate the electrochemical properties of substances in solution or molecules adsorbed on the electrode.
