- a malignant tumor (carcinoma) of the prostate gland, a common form of cancer in elderly men. In most men it progresses slowly over many years and gives symptoms similar to those of benign enlargement of the prostate (see PROSTATE GLAND). Before it was possible to test for prostate specific antigen (PSA), the tumour had often invaded locally, spread to regional lymph nodes, and metastasized to bone before clinical presentation. By checking elevated levels of PSA or PCA3, prostate cancer can be detected 5-10 years before the tumor would present symptomatically. If the disease is confined to the prostate, the patient may be offered active surveillance or radical prostatectomy, radical radiotherapy, or brachytherapy; cryotherapy or HIFU are available in specialized centers. In elderly patients, it may be enough to monitor the tumor growth. If the disease is outside the prostate, androgen deprivation therapy may be used; this may be achieved by gonadorelin analogues, anti-androgens, surgical castration, or oestrogen therapy.
