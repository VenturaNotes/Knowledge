- (cost of goods sold; COGS) A figure representing the cost to an organization of supplying goods or services for sale, excluding administration and other general overheads. In a sales organization, it is the opening stock at the beginning of an accounting period plus the purchases for the period, less the closing stock at the end of the period. In a manufacturing organization, the purchases for the period would be replaced by the production cost of finished goods for the period. In a service providing organization, the cost of sales would be calculated as direct costs adjusted by the opening and closing values of work in progress. The cost of sales figure is deducted from the sales revenue to obtain the gross profit for the period.
