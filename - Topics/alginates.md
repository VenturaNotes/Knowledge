## Source [^1]
- pl. n. derivatives of alginic acid, a complex carbohydrate extracted from certain brown seaweeds, that readily absorb water to form a gel. Alginates are included in many antacid preparations (e.g. Gaviscon) for the relief of heartburn caused by gastro-oesophageal reflux because they form a layer on the stomach contents that protects the oesophagus from acid reflux. As they are highly absorbent, alginates are also used in dressings for exuding wounds.
