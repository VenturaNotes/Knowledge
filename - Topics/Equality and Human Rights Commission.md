- An independent nondepartmental UK public body, in operation since 1 October 2007, whose objectives are to eliminate discrimination, reduce inequality, protect human rights, and build good relations, ensuring that everyone has a fair chance to participate in society. It replaced and combined the responsibilities of three previous equality commissions: the Equal Opportunities Commission, the Commission for Racial Equality, and the Disability Rights Commission. The Equality and Human Rights Commission also has responsibility for human rights and equality with regard to age, sexual orientation, and religion or belief.
