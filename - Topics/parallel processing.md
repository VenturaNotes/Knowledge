- A term applied rather loosely to a number of rather similar concepts but with important detailed differences. The essence of parallel processing is that more than one particular process is active at any given instant; however the term is often applied to a situation in which a large number of processes are potentially active but at any one instant only one is active. Strictly speaking the term parallel processing should only be applied where more than one processor is active among a group of processes at any one instant. In practice it is seldom used with this accurate connotation. See also CONCURRENT PROGRAMMING.
- Parallel running is another term for parallel processing
## Source[^2]
- A method of computing in which two or more parts of a program are executed simultaneously rather than sequentially. Strictly, parallel processing is only possible on computers with more than one arithmetic and logical unit in the central processing unit, but it is often simulated on other machines by such techniques as time sharing.
