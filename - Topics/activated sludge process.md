- A common sewage and waste-water treatment. The sludge produced after primary treatment is pumped into aeration tanks, where it is continuously stirred and aerated, resulting in the formation of small aggregates of suspended colloidal organic matter called floc. Floc contains numerous slime-forming and nitrifying bacteria, as well as protozoans, which decompose organic substances in the sludge. Agitation or air injection maintains high levels of dissolved oxygen, which helps to reduce the biochemical oxygen demand.
