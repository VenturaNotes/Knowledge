- $n$. a semisynthetic penicillin used to treat a variety of infections, including those of the urinary, respiratory, biliary, and intestinal tracts. It is inactivated by penicillinase and therefore cannot be used against organisms producing this enzyme. Side-effects include nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, and some allergic reactions may occur.
