- Wireless datagram protocol (WDP)Â is a service that enables wireless application protocol (WAP) to be 'bearer-independent.' That means users of the protocol are independent from data services that transmit information signals between networks. WDP adapts the transport layer of a data service and presents a consistent data format to the top layer of the WAP protocol stack.
