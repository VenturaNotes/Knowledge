- an acid mucopolysaccharide that acts as the binding and protective agent of the ground substance of connective tissue. It is also present in the synovial fluid around joints and in the vitreous and aqueous humors of the eye.
## Source[^2]
- (hyaluronan) A glycosaminoglycan that is part of the ground substance of connective tissue. Hyaluronic acid is a major component of articular cartilage and skin, helping in tissue repair and the lubrication of joints. It also plays a role in cell movement and proliferation and may contribute to the growth of certain tumors. Consisting of around 25,000 disaccharide residues, it is made by a complex of enzymes on the outer cell surface, and absorbs water molecules to form a hydrated gel. Hyaluronan is commonly used as the basis for fillers in cosmetic surgery. Hyaluronidases break down hyaluronic acid.
## Source[^3]
- A glycosaminoglycan (mucopolysaccharide) that is part of the matrix of connective tissue. Hyaluronic acid binds cells together and helps to lubricate joints. It may play a role in the migration of cells at wounds; this activity ceases when hyaluronidase breaks down hyaluronic acid.
