- Under the Control of Pollution Act 1974 household, commercial, and industrial waste may be disposed of only in licensed sites. Local authorities are generally required to collect household refuse free of charge but there is a charge for the collection of waste from business premises. Businesses now have a duty of care in respect of waste removed from their property by builders, scrap-metal merchants, etc. If the contractors are not registered with the Environment Agency as authorized carriers of waste, the business may be liable for a fine. Waste has traditionally been buried in landfill sites but recent European and UK legislation has placed strict controls on the amount and type of material sent to landfill. Stringent controls on emissions from the incineration of waste were introduced by the Waste Incineration Directive (WID), which applies from December 2005. There are special regulations dealing with the treatment, carriage, and disposal of hazardous waste. See POLLUTION.
