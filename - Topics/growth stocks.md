- Securities that are expected to offer the investor sustained capital growth. Investors and investment managers often distinguish between growth stocks and income stocks. The former are expected to provide capital gains; the latter, high income. The investor will usually expect a growth stock to be an ordinary share in a company whose products are selling well and whose sales are expected to expand, whose capital expenditure on new plant and equipment is high, whose earnings are growing, and whose management is strong, resourceful, and investing in product development and long-term research.
