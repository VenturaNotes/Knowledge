- SLM (service-level management) is a set of ongoing actions that focuses on continually improving service tasks and functions using service-level agreements (SLAs) to ensure that service-level objectives (SLOs) are being met to accommodate the ever-changing requirements of a customer/vendor relationship. In a business, these service levels are initially defined with an SLA and SLO to ensure that all parties are on the same page when it comes to responsibilities and duties that will be provided.
