- $n$. The study of deficits or impairments in human cognitive function resulting from brain damage. Alongside cognitive psychology and artificial intelligence, it is one of the three main approaches to cognition and has been especially fruitful in research into processes such as reading and writing. For example, it has established that different routes exist for translating written words into speech, because some brain-damaged patients with surface dyslexia are able to read only by translating each letter into its corresponding sound and have great difficulty with orthographically irregular words like yacht, whereas others with deep dyslexia or phonological dyslexia can read only by wholeword recognition and have difficulty with simple non-words like bink, because they cannot translate letters into sounds. See also neurolinguistics.
