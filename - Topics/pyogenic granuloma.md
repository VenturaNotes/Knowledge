- a common rapidly growing nodule on the surface of the skin. Resembling a redcurrant or, if large, a raspberry, it is composed of small blood vessels and therefore bleeds readily after the slightest injury. The nodule never becomes malignant and is treated by curettage and cautery; it may recur and require excision.
