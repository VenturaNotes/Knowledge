- A situation in which a market does not operate efficiently. Factors that may cause market failure include the possession of market power by transactors, externalities, or information problems (see ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION). See also EFFICIENT MARKETS HYPOTHESIS.
## Source[^2]
- When the equilibrium of the economy is not Pareto efficient. The main sources of market failure are asymmetric information, externalities, imperfect competition, missing markets, and public goods. The various sources of market failure provide a prima facie case for considering government intervention in the economy. The government may be able to improve on the outcome, but in some instances its actions may also be limited by the same economic features that cause the market failure. See also GOVERNMENT FAILURE.
