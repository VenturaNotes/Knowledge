- temperature expressed on a scale in which the melting point of ice is assigned a temperature of $32^{\circ}$ and the boiling point of water a temperature of $212^{\circ}$. For most medical purposes the Celsius (centigrade) scale has replaced the Fahrenheit scale. The formula for converting from Fahrenheit (F) to Celsius (C) is: C = 5/9 (F - 32). See also Celsius TEMPERATURE. \[G. D. Fahrenheit (1686-1736), German physicist]
