- (retinol) a fat-soluble vitamin that occurs preformed in foods of animal origin (especially milk products, egg yolk, and liver) and is formed in the body from the pigment $\beta$-carotene, present in some vegetable foods (for example green leafy vegetables and carrots). Retinol is essential for growth, vision in dim light, and the maintenance of soft mucous tissue. A deficiency causes stunted growth, night blindness, xerophthalmia, keratomalacia, and eventual blindness. The adult RNI for retinol (see Dietary Reference Values) is $600~ \mu \mathrm{g} /$day for women and $700 ~\mu \mathrm{g} /$day for men. Lactating women need an additional $350 ~\mu \mathrm{g} /$day. A retinol equivalent ( $6~ \mu \mathrm{g} ~\beta$-carotene) is nutritionally equivalent to $1 ~\mu \mathrm{g}$ retinol.
