- The analysis of economic activity based on the fundamental premises that all economic agents have rational preferences, all consumers maximize utility, all firms maximize profit, and all choices are made taking into account relevant constraints. These components produce a variety of results, depending upon the assumptions on the economic environment in which the economic agents interact. For example, if all agents are assumed to be price-takers then a model of a competitive economy is obtained. Alternatively, if it is assumed that a firm is the only supplier of a product (and recognizes this fact) then the model is one of monopoly. Neoclassical economics is the accepted orthodox approach to economics.
