- (DHSC) (in Britain) a department of central government that supports the Secretary of State for Health and Social Care in meeting his or her obligations, which include the National Health Service, the promotion and protection of the health of the nation, and social care, including some oversight of personal social services provided by local authorities. The department is staffed by civil servants, including some health professionals. Following the reforms of the Health and Social Care Act 2012, the Department no longer has direct control of the NHS, which has passed to NHS England. The name of the department was expanded from 'Department of Health' in 2018. Equivalent departments support the ministers responsible for health services in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland.
