- (acne vulgaris) $n$. a common inflammatory disorder of the sebaceous glands. These grease-producing glands are under androgen control, but the cause of acne is unknown. It typically involves the face, back, and chest and is characterized by the presence of blackheads with papules, pustules, and $\textemdash$ in more severe cases $\textemdash$ cysts and scars. Acne is readily treatable. Mild cases respond to topical therapy with benzoyl peroxide, while more refractory conditions require treatment with long-term antibiotics or (for treating women only) the oral contraceptive pill; severe or cystic acne can be treated with oral isotretinoin. Exogenous or occupational factors, such as occlusion from tight or impermeable clothes, make-up, or chemicals, may trigger or exacerbate acne (see CHLORACNE).
