- $n$. the biochemical process, occurring chiefly in the liver and in muscle, by which glucose is converted into glycogen.
## Source[^2]
 - The conversion of glucose to glycogen, which is stimulated by insulin from the pancreas. Glycogenesis occurs in skeletal muscles and to a lesser extent in the liver. Glucose that is taken up by cells is phosphorylated to glucose 6-phosphate; this is converted successively to glucose 1-phosphate, uridine diphosphate glucose, and finally to glycogen. See also GlUCONEOGENESIS. Compare GLYCOGENOLYSIS.
