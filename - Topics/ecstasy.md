Ecstasy: $n$. the street name for methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a mildly hallucinogenic drug that generates feelings of euphoria in those who take it. Its most common side-effect is hyperthermia; drinking large quantities of water to combat the intense thirst produced by taking the drug may result in fatal damage to the body's fluid balance. Its manufacture, sale, use, and possession are illegal.

- $n$. 
- (1) A state of exalted pleasure or euphoria.
- (2) The common name for the central nervous system stimulant and designer drug 3,4-methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), a phenylalkylamine originally synthesized by the pharmaceutical company Merck in 1912 and patented two years later as an appetite suppressant, then rediscovered as a street drug in the late 1970s. It is an amphetamine analogue, sharing many of the characteristics of speed (amphetamine sulphate) but also increasing serotonin and dopamine activity in the brain and inducing feelings of euphoria, empathy, and benevolence. It often causes hyperthermia (overheating) and extreme thirst, especially when accompanied by prolonged and energetic dancing. It sometimes has hallucinogenic effects, though a typical $75\text{-}100~ \mathrm{mg}$ dosage is not normally hallucinogenic, and prolonged use often results in damage to serotonergic nerve fibers. It is sometimes called the hug drug or XTC and has many branded versions and street names, including Adam, apples, doves, E, and Einsteins, and other constantly changing names depending on color and appearance, such as custards, diamonds, rhubarb, and strawberries. See also amphetamine-RELATED DISORDERS, EMPATHOGEN, ENTACTOGEN, SUBSTANCE-RELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISORDERS. Compare YABA. \[From Greek ekstasis trance, from ex out + histanai to cause to stand]
