## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- The use of structural information of a program and a knowledge of the processor instruction or module execution times to synthesize the temporal behavior of a software system. For sequential systems this is a simple analysis. For highly concurrent systems the use of simulation techniques or queuing models may be necessary, and system performance/time response becomes stochastic rather than deterministic. See also PERFORMANCE TESTING.
