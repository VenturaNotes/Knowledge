- Chromosomes having the same structural features. In diploid nuclei, pairs of homologous chromosomes can be identified at the start of meiosis (see PAIRING). One member of each pair comes from the female parent and the other from the male. Homologous chromosomes have the same pattern of genes along the chromosome but the nature of the genes may differ (see ALLELE).
