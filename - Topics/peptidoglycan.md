- A macromolecule that is a component of the cell wall of bacteria; it is not found in eukaryotes. Consisting of chains of amino sugars ($N$-acetylglucosamine and N-acetylmuramic acid) linked to a tripeptide (of alanine, glutamic acid, and lysine or diaminopimelic acid), it confers strength and shape to the cell wall. Archaea possess a similar polysaccharide, pseudopeptidoglycan, with $N\text{-acetyltalosaminuronic}$ acid instead of N-acetylmuramic acid.
