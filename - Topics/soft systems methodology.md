- (SSM) A method for intervening in problem situations that have a human or social component, as opposed to being purely technological. The method suggests that systems capable of producing desired outputs frequently fail because the participants in these systems have differing views of the world, based on differing values and standards. It involves the widest possible research into the nature of the problem, the production of root definitions and conceptual models, the identification of feasible and desirable changes, and, finally, recommendations for action.
