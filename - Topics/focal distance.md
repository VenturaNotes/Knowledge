- (of the eye) the distance between the lens and the point behind the lens at which light from a distant object is focused. In a normally sighted person the point of focus is on the retina, but in myopia (shortsightedness) the focus is in front of the retina and in hypermetropia (longsightedness) the point of focus is beyond the retina.
