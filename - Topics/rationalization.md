- A reorganization of a firm, group, or industry to increase its efficiency and profitability. This may include closing some manufacturing units and expanding others (horizontal integration), merging different stages of the production process (vertical integration), merging support units, closing units that are duplicating effort of others, etc. A firm may also rationalize its product range to reflect changes in demand, concentrating its sales and marketing effort on its best sellers. See also DOWNSIZING; RIGHTSIZING.
