- (vocal cords) the two folds of tissue which protrude from the sides of the larynx to form a narrow slit (glottis) across the air passage (see illustration). Their controlled interference with the expiratory air flow produces audible vibrations that make up speech, song, and all other vocal noises. Alterations in the vocal folds themselves or in their nerve supply by disease interfere with phonation.
