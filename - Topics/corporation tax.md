- The UK system of company taxation. This tax is levied on the trading profits of all companies, with slightly lower rates for smaller companies. The corporation tax was introduced in 1965 with the structure of a classical tax system in which companies were subject to tax on their profits and shareholders were also liable to income tax on the dividends received. The corporation tax was changed to an imputation system in 1973, so that a shareholder receiving a dividend was entitled to an income tax credit representing the corporation tax already paid. The classical system was reintroduced in 1999, with the abolition of advance corporation tax.

- (CT) Tax charged on the total profits of a company resident in the UK arising in each accounting period. The rate of corporation tax depends on the level of profits of the company. The small companies rate of $20 \%$ currently (2016-17) applies to companies with total profits of $£ 300,000$ or less. Full-rate corporation tax of $21 \%$ currently applies to companies with total profits of over $£ 1.5$ million. There is a marginal relief for those companies with total profits between $£ 300,000$ and $£ 1.5$ million. Large companies pay corporation tax in instalments: other companies pay CT nine months after the end of the company's chargeable accounting period. Certain capital allowances are deductible for corporation tax purposes, as are losses carried forward from previous years. Any chargeable gains from the disposal of fixed assets are included in the total profits for corporation tax purposes.
