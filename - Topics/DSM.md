- Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: an influential publication of the American Psychiatric Association in which psychiatric disorders are classified and defined. The current (2013) version is DSM-5, which superseded DSM-IV-TR (2000), a text revision (TR) of the DSM-IV. DSM-5 has attracted much controversy and criticism, notably that it tends to medicalize behavior patterns that many would consider to be normal.
