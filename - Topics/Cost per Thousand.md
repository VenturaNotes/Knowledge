- Cost per thousand is a marketing term that refers to the average cost of thousand advertising impressions. An impression, in this context, means how many times an advertisement makes an impression on the audience via a view or click-through. Cost per thousand is also known as cost per mille (CPM). The lower the CPM, the cheaper it is to gain an advertising impression. A $1 CPM means it costs a business only $1 to get 1,000 advertisement impressions. On the other hand, a CPM of $10 would be ten times more expensive.
