- In economics, the costs incurred in making a bargain, over and above the benefit exchanged. They typically include research costs, bargaining costs, and enforcement costs; there will also be agency costs if an agent is used (see AGENCY RELATIONSHIP). A simple example of a transaction cost is the commission paid to a broker when buying or selling securities.
