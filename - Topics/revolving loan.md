- A loan which is formally for short periods, but which is habitually renewed. Such a loan would be made, for example, by a bank to a shopkeeper financing stocks on credit: sales allow the repayment of loans, but it is profitable for both parties to renew the loans to finance the purchase of further stocks. It is not easy to distinguish such loans from loans renewed because the borrowers cannot repay them.
