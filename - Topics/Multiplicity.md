- A quantity used in atomic spectra to describe the energy levels of many-electron atoms characterized by Russell-Saunders coupling given by $2S+ 1$, where $S$ is the total electron spin quantum number. The multiplicity of an energy level is indicated by a left superscript to the value of $L$, where $L$ is the resultant electron orbital angular momentum of the individual electron orbital angular momenta $l$.
