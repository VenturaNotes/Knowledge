- Mobile payment is payment made through a mobile device such as a smartphone or tablet. This type of payment can be used for various purposes, including making purchases at retail stores, transferring money to a person's account, and paying bills. Mobile payments are becoming more popular because they offer both convenience and security. With a mobile payment app, customers can make transactions quickly and easily without carrying any cash or credit cards. Also, the app's encryption technology protects customer information from being stolen or compromised.
