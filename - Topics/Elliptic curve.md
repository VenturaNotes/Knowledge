- At its simplest an elliptic curve is a non-singular curve in $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the equation $$y^2 = x^3 + px + q.$$The non-singularity then requires that $4p^3 + 27q^2 \ne 0.$ But the study of elliptic curves over the complex numbers (including points at infinity, so studying the curves within the complex projective plane(see PROJECTIVE SPACE)) has a rich history. Such a curve is then topologically a torus and as a Riemann surface can be identified with $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$, where $\Lambda$ is some lattice $a \mathbb{Z} + b\mathbb{Z}$, where a/b is not real. Now $\mathbb{C}/\Lambda$ is an abelian group, and this group structure on the curve manifests geometrically via a theorem due to Abel.
- Elliptic curves over the rational numbers are of great interest in number theory; the Birch-Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture (see APPENDIX 23) concerns them. And over Galois fields, elliptic curves have applications in cryptography. See also DEGREE-GENUS FORMULA
