- The use of mathematical psychology to understand the structure of a market. Consumer images of different brands of a product are plotted on a graph or map; the closer two brands are on the map, the closer they are as competitors. Perceptual mapping is also used in the development of a new product; the closer a new product appears on a map to an ideal product, the more likely the new product is to succeed. It can be useful in determining competitors' positions and what opportunities there are in unoccupied positions.
