- The practice of selling related products and services to existing customers. For example, a car dealer may also offer its customers servicing of the vehicle, valeting, re-upholstering, etc. An insurance broker may also offer motor-car insurance to its house-insurance customers. Businesses often cross-sell as part of their customer loyalty and retention strategy. Research evidence suggests that the greater the number of different products or services a customer buys from the same vendor, the lower the defection rate. See also UP-SELLING.
