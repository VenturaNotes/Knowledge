- A way of checking the plausibility of arithmetic calculations. The sum of the digits of a product equals the product of the sum of the digits of the numbers multiplied. This is because $10^{n}$ is $1$ modulo 9 for all $n$. In all cases the summing of digits is repeated until a single digit (i.e. between 0 and 9) is obtained, called the digital root. For example, 347 has a sum of digits of 14, then 5. Also, 514 has a sum of digits 10, then 1. Then $347 \times 514=178,358$ with a sum of digits of 32, reducing to 5 which is $5 \times 1$. The name arises as any 9 s can be omitted, or cast out, in the process of finding the digital root.
