- Job characteristics other than financial rewards. These include hours and working conditions, number of holidays, training provision, opportunities for promotion, location of the workplace, and personalities of managers and fellow workers. These are contrasted with purely financial conditions, including pay and bonuses, pension rights, free or subsidized medical insurance, and assistance with house purchase. Some job characteristics have a financial value which is difficult to measure explicitly, such as job security, flexible hours, or training which improves a worker's outside job opportunities.
