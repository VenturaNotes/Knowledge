- (GTN) a group of disorders characterized by persistence of gestational trophoblastic disease, with abnormal placental development and very high levels of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). The chorionic villi are fluid-filled with vacuolation of the placenta and destruction of the normal stroma. GTN is rare in the UK, with a calculated incidence of $1 / 714$ live births. It may develop after a molar pregnancy (see HYDATIDIFORM MOLE), a nonmolar pregnancy, or a live birth. The incidence after a live birth is estimated at $1 / 50,000$. A malignant condition may develop (see CHORIOCARCINOMA) if the abnormal tissue is not completely removed and the risk of this is monitored by the fall in hCG levels. Choriocarcinoma complicates approximately 3\% of complete moles, although in $50 \%$ of cases of choriocarcinoma there is no history of immediately preceding trophoblastic disease. It may also occur following a normal pregnancy. In the UK, there is an effective registration and treatment programme. The programme has achieved impressive results, with high cure ($98-100 \%$) and low chemotherapy (5-8%) rates.
