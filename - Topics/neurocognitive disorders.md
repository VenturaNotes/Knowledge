- $n$. An umbrella term introduced in DSM-5 to bring together delirium, dementia, frontotemporal neurocognitive disorder, and other disorders, including those due to Alzheimer's disease, HIV dementia, Huntington's disease, Lewy body dementia, prion disease, Parkinson's disease, traumatic brain injury, vascular dementia, substance/medication use, and other medical conditions. For each of these subtypes, DSM-5 distinguishes between major and mild neurocognitive disorders: a major disorder requires significant cognitive decline or impairment (in attention, executive function, learning, memory, language, perceptual-motor activity, or social cognition) and interference with independent everyday activities; a mild neurocognitive disorder requires evidence of modest cognitive decline or impairment, and independent everyday activities must require special effort or compensation; and in both major and mild neurocognitive disorders, the condition must not consist solely of delirium and must not be better explained by another mental disorder.
