- (ABC ranking) A method of ranking items held in inventory enabling particular attention to be given to those that, if incorrectly managed, will be most damaging to the effectiveness or the efficiency of an operation. Items are categorized according to their value of usage, i.e. their individual value multiplied by their usage rate. In most cases Pareto's Rule then applies, so that approximately $20 \%$ of the items accounts for approximately $80 \%$ of the value of the stock held; these items are classified as Class A items. Class B covers the $30 \%$ of items that represent the next $10 \%$ of value. Class C covers the remaining $50 \%$, which accounts for the remaining $10 \%$ of value. In material requirements planning (MRP), ranking is used to categorize inventory by its impact value, i.e. whether or not production will stop if this item is out of stock.
