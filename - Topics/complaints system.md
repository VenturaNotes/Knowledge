- a process that enables patients to voice concerns about the standard of care they receive. In the UK, any complaints should be raised as soon as possible, in the first instance locally with the NHS provider involved. Various statutory and voluntary advice and advocacy services are available to assist in this. If a patient is not satisfied with the outcome of local resolution, the matter can be referred to the Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman. Legal action cannot usually proceed at the same time and only a small proportion of complaints proceed to law. Disciplinary procedures are separate from the complaints procedure although complaints may prompt or inform disciplinary action.
