- (min) Historically, a computer that physically went within a single equipment cabinet, i.e. on the order of a few cubic feet. Compared with larger computers, minicomputers were cheaper and slower, with smaller memory and usually shorter word length. Minicomputers have largely been replaced by networks of microcomputers.
