- (min) Historically, a computer that physically went within a single equipment cabinet, i.e. on the order of a few cubic feet. Compared with larger computers, minicomputers were cheaper and slower, with smaller memory and usually shorter word length. Minicomputers have largely been replaced by networks of microcomputers.
## Source[^2]
- A computer that is less powerful than a mainframe but more powerful than a personal computer. It is unable to handle as many people or programs at the same time as a mainframe, but it is adequate for a wide range of business and scientific applications.
