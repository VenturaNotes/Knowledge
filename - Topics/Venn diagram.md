- Venn diagram A schematic representation of a set, first used in the 19th century by John Venn. A universal set $U$ will typically be represented by a rectangle, and a subset $S$ of $U$ by the interior of a circle (or another simple closed curve) lying wholly within the rectangle. Some examples are shown in the diagram. Where appropriate, the shaded areas represent the sets indicated beneath each figure.
