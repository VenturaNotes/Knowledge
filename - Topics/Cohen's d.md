- n. A measure of effect size, the most familiar form being the difference between two means ( $M_{1}$ and $M_{2}$ ) expressed in units of standard deviations: the formula is $d=\left(M_{1}-M_{2}\right) / \sigma$, where $\sigma$ is the pooled standard deviation of the scores in both groups. A value of $d$ below 0.20 is considered small, 0.50 medium, and 0.80 large. \[Named after the US psychologist Jacob (Jack) Cohen (1923-98) who devised it and popularized it in his book Statistical Power Analysis for the Behavioral Sciences (1969, 1988)]
