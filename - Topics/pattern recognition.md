- The process of detecting the presence of a specified pattern in a signal, or assigning a probability to its possible presence. For example, visual pattern recognition involves the identification of two-dimensional patterns in a grey-level array. The specification of one of more patterns is done either analytically, or, more usually, by the provision of templates, which are model patterns for comparison. Pattern recognition employs the techniques of digital signal processing, image processing, and artificial intelligence.
