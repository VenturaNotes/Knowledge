- A transmission method that makes use of radio broadcast signals carrying packets of data. There is no assurance that only a single transmitter is active at a time, so it is necessary to have a convention for the action to be taken when packets 'collide'. Logically, packet radio is essentially equivalent to bus architecture networks that are used in some local network architectures.
