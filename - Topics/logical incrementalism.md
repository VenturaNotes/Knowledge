- An approach to business planning that emphasizes small, incremental changes to strategy as the best means of adapting to changing circumstances. The concept was introduced in 1980 by James Quinn, who characterized it as an evolutionary, fragmented, and intuitive method of approaching change, in which past experience is used as a basis for future plans. Logical incrementalism thus contrasts with models that see planning and strategy in terms of big, overarching decisions.
