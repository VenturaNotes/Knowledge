- $n$. one of the four principles and common to many theories of medical ethics: doctors should avoid causing harm to patients (see PRIMUM NON NOCERE). As almost all medical interventions carry some risk of harm, however small, in practice a doctor should avoid risking unnecessary harm or any harm that is disproportionate to the benefit intended. Consequently, risks should be minimized and considered along with the intended benefits when evaluating specific interventions. Harm can include psychological, emotional, or social harm as well as physical damage. Compare BENEFICENCE.
