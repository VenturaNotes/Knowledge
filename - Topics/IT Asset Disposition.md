- IT asset disposition (ITAD) refers to the practice of appropriately disposing and decommissioning IT assets, such as computer hardware and electronic devices. IT organizations may practice IT asset disposition on their own or hire a specialized vendor to handle this process. ITAD typically involves the reusing, recycling, repurposing, repairing, or disposing of unwanted IT equipment in a way that is both environmentally responsible and safe. ITAD aims to secure data by ensuring that storage devices are securely wiped before being disposed of. ITAD also focuses on recycling, repairing, and reusing devices and hardware. ITAD vendors typically deal with various types of computer devices, including but not limited to desktops, laptops, servers, tablets, phone, RAM storage devices, video cards, and motherboards.
