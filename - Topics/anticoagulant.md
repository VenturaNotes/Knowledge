- $n$. an agent that prevents the clotting of blood. The natural anticoagulant heparin directly interferes with blood clotting and is active both within the body and against a sample of blood in a test tube. Synthetic drugs, such as warfarin, are effective only within the body, since they act by affecting blood coagulation factors (see BLOOD COAGULATION). They take longer to act than heparin. Anticoagulants are used to prevent the formation of blood clots or to break up clots in blood vessels in such conditions as thrombosis and embolism. Incorrect dosage may result in haemorrhage (see INR). See also DIRECT ORAL ANTICOAGULANT; FIBRINOLYTIC.
