- A nerve cell (see NEURON) that transmits information about changes in the internal or external environment to the central nervous system. Sensory neurons are of two types. Somatic sensory neurons occur in peripheral nerves in the skin, skeletal muscle, joints, and bones. Visceral sensory neurons are located in sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves in the heart, lungs, and other organs.
