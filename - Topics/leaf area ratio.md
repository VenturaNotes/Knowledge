- (LAR) The total leaf area of a plant divided by the dry mass of the entire plant. Typically measured in square centimetres per gram or square metres per kilogram, it indicates the efficiency with which a plant uses its leaves to produce plant material. It is equal to the product of the leaf mass ratio (LMR) and the specific leaf area (SLA).
