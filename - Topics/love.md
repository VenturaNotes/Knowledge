- $n$. An intense feeling of fondness or attraction, deeper and stronger than liking, especially when associated with a romantic or sexual attachment to someone. According to a popular taxonomy proposed by the Canadian sociologist John Alan Lee (1933-2013) in The Colors of Love: An Exploration of the Ways of Loving (1973), there are three primary and three secondary types of love that blend into different shades like colors, the three primary types being eros (erotic or passionate love), ludus (ludic or playful love), and storge (storgic or friendly/affectionate love), and the three secondary types pragma (pragmatic or utilitarian love, a combination of ludus and storge), mania (manic or obsessive/possessive love, a combination of eros and ludus), and agape (agapic or brotherly love, an altruistic or selfless combination of eros and storge). According to the triangular theory of love proposed in 1986 by the US psychologist Robert J(effrey) Sternberg (born 1949), there are three basic components of love, namely passion (sexual desire), intimacy (confiding and sharing feelings), and commitment (intention to maintain the relationship), different combinations of the three components yielding eight basic types: non-love (none of the three components present), infatuated love (passion only), liking/friendship (intimacy only), empty love (commitment only), romantic love (passion and intimacy), companionate love (intimacy and commitment), fatuous love (passion and commitment), and consummate love (passion, intimacy, and commitment).
