## Source [^1]
- A monosaccharide or disaccharide sugar that can donate electrons to other molecules and can therefore act as a reducing agent. The possession of a free ketone (-CO-) or aldehyde (-CHO) group enables most monosaccharides and disaccharides to act as reducing sugars. Reducing sugars can be detected by Benedict's test. Compare NONREDUCING SUGAR.
