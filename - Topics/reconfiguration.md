## Source [^1]
- The process of redefining and in some cases reconnecting the units of a multiple-unit computer system. This procedure may be accomplished automatically, manually, or by a combination of both. The purpose may be to provide different system functionality or continued operation after the failure of one unit. If done automatically the latter case would represent a fail-soft situation. See also CONFIGURATION.
