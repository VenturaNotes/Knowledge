- Loyalty marketing focuses on creating long-term relationships by rewarding customers for purchasing or engaging with a brand. It involves the management of customer loyalty discounts, loyalty schemes, or benefits for sharing information about the brand with peers. Loyalty marketing also helps promote repeat purchases and positive word-of-mouth from existing customers. It ensures existing customers get the same or better benefits than new customers or get exclusive access to new launches.
