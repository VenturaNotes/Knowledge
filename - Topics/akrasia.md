The concept was discussed at length by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384322 вс) in Nicomachean Ethics (Book 7), where he contrasted akrasia and its corresponding virtue, self-control, with self-indulgence and its corresponding virtue, temperance. Aristotle illustrated the distinction with an example of eating sweet foods: 'The one \[the self-indulgent person] is led on in accordance with his own choice, thinking that he ought always to pursue the present pleasure; while the other \[the akrates] does not think so but yet pursues it' (Bekker edition, p. 1146b). Also spelt acrasia . akratic adj. Acting against one's better judgement. akrates or akratic $n$. An akratic person. \[From Greek $a$ - without + kratos power + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
