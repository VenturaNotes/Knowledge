- A method of allocating CPU time in a multiuser environment. Each user is allocated a small amount or quantum of processor time. Once a userâ€™s quantum is exhausted, control passes to the next user. The round robin scheduler bears many resemblances to the feedback queue, which can be thought of as a refinement of the simple round robin scheduler
