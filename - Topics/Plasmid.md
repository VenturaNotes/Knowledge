## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A structure in bacterial cells consisting of a looped DNA molecule that can exist and replicate independently of the chromosome. Plasmids provide genetic instructions for certain cell activities (e.g. resistance to antibiotic drugs). They can be transferred from cell to cell in a bacterial colony ( see LATERAL GENE TRANSFER; SEX FACTOR). Plasmids are widely used as vectors to produce recombinant DNA for gene cloning.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A circular fragment of DNA that is not part of a chromosome but exists and reproduces autonomously in the cytoplasm of a cell. Bacterial plasmids can be transmitted between bacteria of the same or different species and are useful in genetic engineering. See also jumping GENE, PLASMAGENE. Compare Mitochondrial DNA. \[From (cyto)plasm + -is, -idos daughter of, indicating a particle, body, or structure]
