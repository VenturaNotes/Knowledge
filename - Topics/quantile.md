- For any number $p$ between 0 and 1, the $p$th population quantile is the number $x$ such that the probability of a value below $x$ occurring equals $p$; in other words, population quantile is the inverse cumulative distribution function. In a sample of size $N$, the $p$th quantile is the observation such that approximately $N p$ of the observations are less than this observation and $N(1-p)$ of the observations are larger. The $p$th quantile is also referred to as the (100p)th percentile. The 0.5th quantile is the median; the 0.25th and the 0.75th quantiles are called the lower and the upper quartiles. The distance between the lower and upper quartiles, called the interquartile range, is sometimes used as a measure of dispersion.
