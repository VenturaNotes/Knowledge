- In the same way that general topology focuses on continuous functions and related spaces, differential topology focuses on spaces and functions that are smooth. Smooth manifolds are the main spaces of interest, and the notion of equivalence is diffeomorphic. Stokesâ€™ Theorem and the Divergence Theorem are theorems of differential topology. The Classification Theorem for Surfaces which are closed and smooth is essentially the same as the continuous version, but in dimensions 4 and above very different results arise.
