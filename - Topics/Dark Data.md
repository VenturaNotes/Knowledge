- Businesses of all sizes collect an immense amount of data as part of their day-to-day operations. While a lot of this information is used for purposes such as marketing or analytics, some data is not used, analyzed, or processed at all. This unused, collected data is known as dark data. Examples of dark data often include data sets such as the geolocation of consumers, employee data, and log files.
