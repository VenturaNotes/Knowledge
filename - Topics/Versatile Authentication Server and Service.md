- A versatile authentication server and service (VAS) is a type of security and accessibility tool. It can ensure that a user can use the same authentication method to access numerous devices or tools. A VAS works either on-site or with cloud software, increasing the ease of access to an entire suite of software. Furthermore, a VAS can easily integrate with other third-party software which enables a business to easily combine multiple tools in order to create a single overarching security system.
