- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a type of object-choice in which one chooses a love-object according to characteristics that the person shares with oneself. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced this concept in 1911 in an article 'Psycho-analytic Notes on an Autobiographical Account of a Case of Paranoia (Dementia Paranoides)' (Standard Edition, XII, pp. 9-82, at pp. 60-1) and developed it fully in 1914 in an article 'On Narcissism: An Introduction' (Standard Edition, XIV, pp. 73-102, at pp. 88-91), citing the fact that homosexuals take themselves as models in object-choices as 'the strongest of the reasons that have led us to adopt the hypothesis of narcissism' (p. 88). See also narciSSISM. Compare anaclitic OBJECT-CHOICE.
