- A UK body set up in 2014 to replace the Competition Commission and the Office of Fair Trading, with the same aims: controlling monopoly and encouraging competition. The CMA is empowered to investigate situations of market domination, where an existing firm or group of firms acting in concert has 40 per cent or more of a market, and mergers where a proposed merged firm would have more than 25 per cent of a market. It can also investigate restrictive practices or illegal collusion, bring criminal proceedings, and enforce a range of consumer protection legislation against violators of competition law.
