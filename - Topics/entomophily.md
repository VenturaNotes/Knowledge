- Pollination of a flower in which the pollen is carried on an insect. Entomophilous flowers are usually brightly colored and scented and often secrete nectar. In some species (e.g. primulas) there are structural differences between the flowers to ensure that cross-pollination occurs. Other examples of entomophilous flowers are orchids and antirrhinums. Compare ANEMOPHILY; HYDROPHILY.
