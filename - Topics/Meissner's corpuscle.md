- $n$. An egg-shaped sensory receptor in hairless skin, found most abundantly in the finger pads but also present in the skin of the inner forearm, foot, breast nipple, and lips, containing a single nerve fibre that spirals around the interior of the capsule and ends in a globular mass, sensitive to vibration when moving over textured or embossed surfaces. Also called a tactile corpuscle or a Wagner-Meissner corpuscle. Compare free nerve ending, Golgi tendon organ, Merkel cell, Pacinian corpuscle, Ruffini corpuscle. \[Named after the German anatomist Georg Meissner (1829-1905) who discovered it]
