- (CPD) the state in which the diameter of the fetal head is greater than the pelvic outlet, preventing successful vaginal delivery. This may be relative when there is malposition of the vertex (back of the head) or absolute when the vertex is in the occipitoanterior position (see OCCIPUT), and can only be considered when the cervix is fully dilated.
