- sudden extensive damage to the left ventricle that classically occurs following acute emotional shock. The clinical syndrome mimics acute myocardial infarction, but no coronary artery is occluded and the extent of ventricular damage exceeds that supplied by any single coronary artery. The appearance of the left ventriculogram resembles a Japanese lobster pot, from which the name derives. The cause is unknown, and in most cases spontaneous recovery occurs.
