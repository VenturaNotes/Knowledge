- (apoplexy) $n$. a sudden attack of weakness usually affecting one side of the body. It is the consequence of an interruption to the flow of blood to the brain. An ischaemic stroke occurs when the flow of blood is prevented by clotting (see THROMBOSIS) or by a detached clot, either from the heart or a large vessel (such as the carotid artery), that lodges in an artery (see EMBOLISM). A haemorrhagic stroke results from rupture of an artery wall (see CEREBRAL HAEMORRHAGE). Prolonged reduction of blood pressure may result in more diffuse brain damage, as after a cardiorespiratory arrest. A stroke can vary in severity from a passing weakness or tingling in a limb (see TRANSIENT ISCHAEMIC ATTACK) to a profound paralysis, coma, and death.
