- $n$. a tissue whose cells have the ability to contract, producing movement or force (see illustration). Muscles possess mechanisms for converting energy derived from chemical reactions into mechanical energy. The major functions of muscles are to produce movements of the body, to maintain the position of the body against the force of gravity, to produce movements of structures inside the body, and to alter pressures or tensions of structures in the body. There are three types of muscle: striated muscle, attached to the skeleton; smooth muscle, which is found in such tissues as the stomach, gut, and blood vessels; and cardiac muscle, which forms the walls of the heart.

## Source[^2]
- A tissue consisting of sheets or bundles of cells (muscle fibers) that are capable of contraction, so producing movement or tension in the body. There are three types of muscle. Skeletal muscle produces voluntary movement (e.g. at joints); smooth muscle mainly effects the movements of hollow organs (e.g. intestine and bladder); and cardiac muscle occurs only in the heart.

- $n$. Contractile tissue composed of bundles of elongated cells, some with multiple nuclei, by which movement of organs and parts of the body is effected; or a structure such as the biceps consisting of muscle tissue. The three main types of muscle tissue are cardiac muscle, smooth muscle, and striped muscle.
