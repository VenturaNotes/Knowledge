- a tendon reflex that acts at the level of the seventh cervical spinal nerve. With the elbow flexed and relaxed, the triceps tendon is struck just above the elbow, causing contraction of the triceps and extension of the elbow. This reflex is increased in upper motor neuron lesions and absent in lower motor neuron lesions.
