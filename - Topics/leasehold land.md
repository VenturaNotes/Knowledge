- Land held under a lease. The land will eventually revert to the freehold owner, although there has been some statutory modification of this right to repossession (e.g. in the Rent Acts). This is the most common way for blocks of offices to be owned. The landlord maintains possession of the common parts and creates separate leases for each office. The ownership of each office may subsequently change as leases are assigned.
