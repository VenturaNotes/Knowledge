- $n$. One of the most popular personality questionnaires, especially in commercial and industrial contexts, designed to implement the theory of function types first suggested in 1923 by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961). It contains 126 items in its standard form (G) and 132 in its advanced form (K), all the items being concerned with preferences and inclinations, and it measures four bipolar dimensions: extraversion (E) versus introversion (I), sensing (S) versus intuition (N), thinking (T) versus feeling (F), and judging (J) versus perceiving (P). These four dimensions are combined to yield 16 types, each characterized by a different score pattern represented by a four-letter type description: ESTJ, ESTP,..., INFP. See also cognitive style, temperament theory. MBTI abbrev. \[Named after the US novelist and playwright Isabel McKelvey Myers (1897-1980) and her mother, the self-taught US psychologist Katharine Elizabeth Briggs (1875-1968), who jointly introduced the earliest version of it in 1943]
