## Source [^1]
- For businesses, a solution is the answer to a problem, typically in the application of skilled personnel, expert teams, business tools, or software.
## Source[^2]
- A homogeneous mixture of a liquid (the solvent) with a gas or solid (the solute). In a solution, the molecules of the solute are discrete and mixed with the molecules of solvent. There is usually some interaction between the solvent and solute molecules. For example, when sodium chloride dissolves in water the sodium ions attract polar water molecules, with the negative oxygen ion pointing towards the positive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ ion. This is called hydration.
