- $n$. X-ray imaging of the vas deferens. A contrast medium is injected either into the exposed vas deferens at surgery, using a fine needle, or into the ejaculatory duct (which discharges semen from the vesicle into the vas deferens) by inserting a catheter via an endoscope. The technique is used in the investigation of azoospermia, to look for blockages in the vas.
