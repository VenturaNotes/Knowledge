- The British Telecommunications Corporation was formed in 1981 as a public corporation to control the UK telephone and telecommunications system, which had previously been the responsibility of the Post Office. In 1984 this became British Telecommunications plc, when $51 \%$ of the shares were sold to the public; the remaining government shares were sold in the early 1990s. British Telecom no longer has a monopoly to run telecommunications in the UK but continues to provide virtually all the lines and exchanges for the country's fixed-line telephones.
