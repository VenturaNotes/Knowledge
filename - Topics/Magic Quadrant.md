- Gartnerâ€™s Magic Quadrant is a graphical representation of how how vendors within a certain market are performing and where that market is trending. The two major measurements for vendors on a Magic Quadrant are "Completeness of Vision" and "Ability to Execute." Within the Quadrant, vendors are split into Niche Players, Visionaries, Leaders, or Challengers. Gartner developed the Magic Quadrant and assesses vendors based on a standard criteria and methodology.
