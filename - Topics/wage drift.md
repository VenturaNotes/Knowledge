- The tendency for the average level of wages actually paid to rise faster than wage rates. This may be due to increases in overtime, increases in special allowances, the operation of age-based salary scales, or upgrading of job descriptions. Wage drift is particularly likely during booms when labour is relatively scarce, and during periods of attempted wage control, which firms try to evade.
