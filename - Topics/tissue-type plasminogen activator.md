- (tPA, TPA) a natural protein, found in the body and able to be manufactured by genetic engineering, that can break up a thrombus (see THROMBOLYSIS). It requires the presence of fibrin as a cofactor and is able to activate plasminogen on the fibrin surface, which distinguishes it from the other plasminogen activators, streptokinase and urokinase. tPAs include reteplase and tenecteplase, given to treat acute myocardial infarction, and alteplase.
