- (IGRT) the process of imaging during a course of radiation treatment to verify the internal position of the target in comparison to the initial planning scan. This enables adjustment of treatment fields to improve coverage and allows the use of smaller treatment volumes. The possible methods for IGRT include cone beam CT, tomotherapy, cyberknife, and ultrasound and kilovoltage X-rays of implanted fiducial markers.
