- Two species with a looped or ringlike distribution pattern, for example circumpolar, which comprises a series of interbreeding forms that are intermediate between the two species. The latter occur where the two ends of the 'ring' meet. Ring species thus demonstrate how the evolution of differences among the different populations or subspecies leads eventually to the formation of new species.
