- $n$. Any complex vowel sound comprising a glide from one vowel sound to another within a single syllable, with movement of the tongue between the two sounds. In Received Pronunciation there are three diphthongs in which the final sound is similar to the vowel in tip (as in the words day, tie, boy); two in which the final vowel sound is similar to the vowel in put (as in go and how); and three in which the final vowel sound is similar to the vowel in the (as in veer, care, and poor). Compare DIGRAPH, MONOPHTHONG, TRIPHTHONG. \[From Greek di- two + phthongos sound]
