- A phenotype that is not genetically determined but mimics one that is. This occurs most commonly when environmental influences alone, such as diet, evoke a developmental trait that has a very similar genetic counterpart. For example, dietary deficiency of vitamin D causes the bone disease rickets, and this form cannot be readily distinguished from genetically determined (nondietary) forms of the disease due to malabsorption or excessive loss of bone minerals.
