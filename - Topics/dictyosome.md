- A cup-shaped array of flattened membranous vesicles found in plant cells. Dictyosomes modify proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum, and may also polymerize sugars to polysaccharides. They then package these materials for delivery to destinations within the cell (e.g. the cell wall), for secretion, or for storage. In animal cells, and rarely in plant cells, numerous dictyosomes associate to form the Golgi apparatus.
