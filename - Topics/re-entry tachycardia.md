- a rapid heart rate due to a self-sustaining circulation of electrical impulses from the atria to the ventricles and back again. This re-entry circuit requires the presence of an abnormal second electrical conduction pathway in addition to the usual atrioventricular nodal connection route. The abnormal pathway may be located within the atrioventricular node (causing atrioventricular nodal re-entry tachycardia) or it may be an accessory pathway situated outside the atrioventricular node (causing atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia) or it may be an accessory pathway situated outside the atrioventricular node (causing atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia). Medication is often effective and radiofrequency ablation is usually curative.
