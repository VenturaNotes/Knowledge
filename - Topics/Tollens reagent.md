- A reagent used in testing for aldehydes, named after German chemist B. C. G. Tollens (1841-1918). It is made by adding sodium hydroxide to silver nitrate to give silver(I) oxide, which is dissolved in aqueous ammonia (giving the complex ion $\left.\left[\mathrm{Ag}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{3}\right)_{2}\right]^{+}\right)$. The sample is warmed with the reagent in a test tube. Aldehydes reduce the complex $\mathrm{Ag}^{+}$ion to metallic silver, forming a bright silver mirror on the inside of the tube (hence the name silver-mirror test). Ketones give a negative result.
