- In computer graphics the simulation of transparency includes both unrealistic but cheap techniques in which only the surface of the 'transparent' object modifies the color of the light, and more complex methods in which the distance travelled through the transparent object is accounted for and refractions and so on may be modeled. More advanced techniques include the modelling of internal scattering, which gives a more realistic impression of translucency.
