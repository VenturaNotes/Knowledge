- $n$. In social psychology and the social sciences generally, any behaviour that is characterized by intentionality (2) and is therefore subjectively understandable, according to a distinction introduced by the German economist and sociologist Max Weber (1864-1920) in the first chapter of his book Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft (Economy and Society), published posthumously in 1922. For example, burping involuntarily at a dinner party is behaviour, whereas apologizing afterwards is action. See also Verstehen. More generally, the process of doing something, or an instance of something done. \[From Latin actio action, from agere to do or to act + -ion indicating a process]
