- $(TXA_2)$ a substance related to prostaglandins that is released by platelets activated by local tissue injury and promotes blood clotting and vasconstriction. See Platelet activation. Compare PROSTACYCLIN.
## Source[^2]
- $(TXA_2)$ An eicosanoid, related to the prostaglandins, that promotes blood clotting and causes constriction of blood vessels (vasoconstriction). It is released by platelets when these are activated by local tissue damage and attracts other platelets to the injury site, forming a platelet plug. Its action thus antagonizes that of prostacyclin. $\mathrm{TXA}_{2}$ is spontaneously converted to the inactive $\mathrm{TXB}_{2}$.
