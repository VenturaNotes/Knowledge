- a major genetic disorder caused by a constriction near the end of the long arm of an X chromosome: it is inherited as an X-linked dominant characteristic. The fragile-X syndrome is second only to Down's syndrome as a cause of learning disability. Affected males have unusually high foreheads, unbalanced faces, large jaws, long protruding ears, and large testicles. They have an IQ below 50 and are prone to violent outbursts. Folic acid helps to control their behaviour. About one-third of the females with this mutation on one of their two X chromosomes also show developmental delay. Screening for the characteristic chromosome can be done by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling.
