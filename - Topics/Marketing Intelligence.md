- Marketing intelligence refers to the tools and processes for collecting data about an organization’s marketing workflows and then using this data to drive marketing decisions. Identifying promising opportunities, developing strategies for penetrating new markets and targeting certain customers and segments are just a few potential use cases of marketing intelligence. The types of information collected for marketing intelligence include data about customers, prospective customers, competitors, new products and market trends. Marketing intelligence can help answer crucial questions such as “What is the most efficient way to allocate limited marketing resources?” and “What are the most effective ways to win back lost customers?”
