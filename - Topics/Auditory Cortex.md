- $n$. Areas of the cerebral cortex, namely the primary auditory cortex and the auditory association cortex, devoted to processing information from the organs of hearing. In each cerebral hemisphere, the primary auditory cortex occupies Heschl's gyrus, a small gyrus running transversely across the superior temporal gyrus, the upper gyrus of the temporal lobe (temporal operculum). It is divided into separate bands responding to particular tonal frequencies, and projections from the basilar membranes of both ears are represented in a tonotopic map in each hemisphere. In the (usually) left hemisphere it includes Wernicke's area, and the auditory association cortex is adjacent to it in the superior temporal gyrus. See also inferior COLlICUlus, MEDIAL GENICULATE NUCLEUS.
