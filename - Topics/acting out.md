It is often impulsive and aggressive, and it is usually uncharacteristic of the patient's normal behavior. The concept was introduced by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) in An Outline of PsychoAnalysis (1938/40): the patient 'acts it [the past event] before us, as it were, rather than reporting it to us' (Standard Edition, XXIII, pp. 144-207, at p. 176). See also acting in.
