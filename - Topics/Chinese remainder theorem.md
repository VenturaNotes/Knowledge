- Chinese remainder theorem Let

  

$$

m_{1}, m_{2}, \ldots, m_{r}

$$

  

be positive integers that are relatively prime to one another, and let their product be $m$ :

  

$$

m=m_{1} m_{2} \ldots m_{r}

$$

  

Let $n, u_{1}, u_{2}, \ldots, u_{r}$ be integers; then there is exactly one integer, $u$, that satisfies

  

$$

n \leq u<(m+n)

$$

  

and

  

$$

u \equiv u_{j}\left(\text { modulo } m_{j}\right) \text { for } 1 \leq j \leq r
