- The mapping from a data structure to its implementation (which may be another data structure). Thus a date may be represented as a vector of three integers (with six permutations to choose from), directly as a string of characters, or, in more recent high-level languages, as a record with three selectorsâ€”day, month, and year. A good choice of storage structure permits an easy and efficient implementation of a given data structure.
