- The price of a raw material, product, service, security, etc., in an open market. In formal markets, such as a stock exchange, commodity market, foreign-exchange market, etc., there is often a margin between the buying and selling price; there are, therefore, two market prices. In these circumstances the market prices often quoted are the average of the buying and selling price (see MIDDLE PRICE). See also MARKET VALUE.
