- (selective internal radiation therapy; SIRT) $n$. an interventional radiology technique used in liver cancers. It is similar to transarterial chemoembolization, but instead of a chemotherapeutic agent yttrium-90 particles are injected into the liver. These emit beta radiation, which kills the cells within 2 mm of their radius. SIRT is a palliative technique.
