- A person or company who does not trade as a principal, but puts buyers and sellers in touch with one another. Stockbrokers do this for stocks and shares, commodity brokers for commodities, insurance brokers for insurance policies, and shipping brokers for tramp and charter shipping. Brokers are able to charge commission for this service because of their specialized knowledge of the markets.

- A broker, otherwise referred to as an investment broker, is a financial professional that buys and sells securities for clients in exchange for a commission. There are two types of investment brokers: a discount broker and a full-service broker. A discount broker facilitates securities trades on the behalf of a client for a discounted rate and does not offer their clientele investment advice. A full-service broker offers their client various services including investment advice, retirement planning, and other types of investing services. Corporations that have a surplus of income often hire brokers to help them open a business brokerage account. A brokerage account allows corporations to invest in securities as a business in an attempt to grow their finances.

- An agent who brings two parties together, enabling them to enter into a contract to which the broker is not a principal. The broker's remuneration consists of a brokerage, usually calculated as a percentage of the sum involved in the contract but sometimes fixed by a tariff. Brokers are used because they have specialized knowledge of certain markets or to conceal the identity of a principal, in addition to introducing buyers to sellers. See AVIATION BROKER; BILL BROKER; COMMODITY BROKER; INSURANCE BROKER; SHIPBROKER; STOCKBROKER.
