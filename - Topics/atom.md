- A value that cannot be decomposed further. In Lisp an atom is a representation of an arbitrary string of characters or the special atom NIL, i.e. nothing. The word is also used as a predicate in Lisp-like languages to determine whether an arbitrary value is or is not an atom: $$(atom(cons(h,t)))$$always yields FALSE but $$(atom, NIL)$$and $$(atom,\text{'word'})$$evaluate to TRUE.
