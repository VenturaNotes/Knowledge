## Synthesis
- Used for web browsing (HTTP) and communication between web servers and clients
	- Essentially different aspects of the same protocol (HTTP)
	- [[Web browsing]] involves clients (such as web browsers) requesting and receiving web pages from web servers using HTTP over port 80
- Port 80 is the default for HTTP, but HTTP can operate on other ports if configured
	- #question what other ports can HTTP operate on? Is there a range?
