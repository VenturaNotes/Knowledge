- The skills, general or specific, acquired by an individual in the course of training and work experience. The concept was introduced by Gary Becker (1930-2014) in the 1960s in order to point out that wages reflect in part a return on human capital. This theory has been used to explain large variations in wages for apparently similar jobs and why even in a recession a firm may retain its workers on relatively high wages, despite high levels of involuntary unemployment. See also INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL.
