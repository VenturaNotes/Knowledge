- The skills, general or specific, acquired by an individual in the course of training and work experience. The concept was introduced by Gary Becker (1930-2014) in the 1960s in order to point out that wages reflect in part a return on human capital. This theory has been used to explain large variations in wages for apparently similar jobs and why even in a recession a firm may retain its workers on relatively high wages, despite high levels of involuntary unemployment. See also INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL.

- The stock of knowledge, skills, and abilities that determine the labour productivity of an individual. Investment in human capital through education and training can increase the stock, and such investment is one of the sources of economic growth. See also PHYSICAL CAPITAL.
