Statins can lower the levels of low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) by $25-45 \%$ and are used mainly to treat hypercholesterolaemia but also to reduce the risk of coronary heart disease in susceptible patients. Muscle inflammation and breakdown (see RHABDOMYOLYSIS) is a rare but serious side-effect of statins. The class includes atorvastatin, fluvastatin, pravastatin, rosuvastatin, and simvastatin.
