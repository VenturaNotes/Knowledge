- (red blood cell) $n$. a blood cell containing the red pigment haemoglobin, the principal function of which is the transport of oxygen. A mature erythrocyte has no nucleus and its shape is that of a biconcave disc, approximately $7 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter. There are normally about $5 \times 10^{12}$ erythrocytes per litre of blood. See also ERYTHROPOIESIS.

- (red blood cell) The most numerous type of blood cell, which contains the red pigment haemoglobin and is responsible for oxygen transport and for transport of some carbon dioxide (as a carbamino group). When mature, mammalian erythrocytes are discshaped and lack a nucleus and mitochondria; those of other vertebrates are oval and nucleated. Human erythrocytes are $7\textendash8~ \mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter and number some 5 to 6 million per cubic millimetre of blood. Each is capable of carrying about 1 billion molecules of oxygen. They survive for about four months and are then destroyed in the spleen and liver. See also ERYTHROPOIESIS. Compare LEUCOCYTE.

- $n$. A red button-shaped blood corpuscle containing haemoglobin and transporting oxygen to and carbon dioxide from body tissues. Also called a red blood cell or red blood corpuscle. See also ERYTHROPOIETIN, STEM CELL. Compare LEUCOCYTE. \[From Greek erythros red + kytos a vessel]
