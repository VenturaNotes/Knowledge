- (GnRH, gonadorelin) a peptide hormone produced in the hypothalamus and transported via the bloodstream to the pituitary gland, where it controls the synthesis and release of pituitary gonadotrophins. It may be used to test the ability of the pituitary to produce gonadotrophins. Gonadorelin analogues are used to treat endometriosis, fibroids, some types of infertility, and prostate cancer.
