- $n$. a technique for recording the electrical activity of the heart. Electrodes connected to the recording apparatus (electrocardiograph) are placed on the skin of the four limbs and chest wall; the record itself is called an electrocardiogram (ECG). In conventional scalar electrocardiography 12 leads (see LEAD ${ }^{2}$ ) are recorded, but more may be employed in special circumstances. Intracardiac electrocardiography involves the passage of a recording catheter into the heart for accurate mapping and analysis of arrhythmias (see ELECTROPHYSIOLOGICAL STUDY).
