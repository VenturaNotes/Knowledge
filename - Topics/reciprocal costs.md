- Costs apportioned from a service cost center to a production cost center that carries out work for the original service cost center. Consequently, a proportion of the production cost center costs should also be reapportioned to the service cost center. Cost apportionment can be calculated either by the use of simultaneous equations or by a continuous apportionment method, until all the costs are charged to the production cost center.
