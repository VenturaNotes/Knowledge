- $n$. an accumulation of lymph in the tissues, producing swelling; the legs are most often affected. It may be due to a congenital abnormality of the lymphatic vessels (as in Milroy's disease, congenital lymphoedema of the legs) or result from obstruction of the lymphatic vessels by a tumor, parasites, inflammation, or injury. Treatment consists of elastic support, by stockings or bandages, and diuretic drugs. A variety of surgical procedures has been devised but with little success.
