- Any computer used as a component in a device whose prime function is not that of a computer. One example is a weapons-guidance system. Another is a computer-controlled blood analyzer that uses a computer to control various tests that are run on blood in order to produce an integrated printout of all test results. Many vehicles and domestic products now contain embedded computers.
