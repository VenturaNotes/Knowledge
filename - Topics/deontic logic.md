- $n$. A branch of modal logic devoted to the study of propositions expressing obligation and permission, first suggested by the Finnish logician Georg Henrik von Wright (1916-2003) in an article in the journal Mind in 1951 and chapter 5 of his book Essay in Modal Logic (1951). It is concerned with seeking to discover and understand what actions a person should or may perform, in contrast to conventional logic, which seeks to discover and understand what propositions a person should or may believe to be true. Several formal systems have been developed in which obligation and permission stand in a relation of duality to each other, as when permission to perform an action $p$ is defined as not being obliged not to perform $p$.
