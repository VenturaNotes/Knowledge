- A continuous distribution, denoted $\chi_{(n)}^{2}$, described by the density function$$f(x)=\frac{1}{\Gamma(n / 2) 2^{n / 2}} x^{\frac{n}{2}-1} e^{-x / 2}, 0 \leq x<\infty, n=1,2 \ldots$$and the moment generating function$$M(t)=(1-2 t)^{-n / 2}, t<\frac{1}{2}$$The parameter $n$ is termed 'the degrees of freedom'. 
- It is a particular case of gamma distribution $(\alpha=n / 2, \beta=2)$. This distribution can be derived from the normal distribution and arises in econometrics as the distribution of sums of certain random variables. In particular, if $z$ is a standard normal random variable then $z^{2}$ has $\chi_{(1)}^{2}$-distribution, and if $z_{1}, \ldots, z_{n}$ are independent standard normal random variables then the sum $z_{1}{ }^{2}+\ldots+z_{n}{ }^{2}$ has $\chi_{(n)}^{2}$-distribution. A $\chi_{(n)}^{2}$-random variable has mean $n$ and variance $2 n$. It is the limiting distribution of the scaled $F$-distribution and is used for hypothesis testing in many econometric applications.

- $n$. In statistics, a probability distribution used to obtain an approximate measure of the discrepancy between sets of observed and expected scores and to perform a chi-square test. If a set of values distributed according to the normal distribution are squared and then summed, the resulting scores are distributed according to the chi-square distribution. Symbol: $\chi^{2}$. \[Named after the square of chi the 22nd letter of the Greek alphabet]
