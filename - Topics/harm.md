- $n$. physical, mental, or moral damage or the threat of this. Avoiding it is one of the ethical four principles known as nonmaleficence. Although health service staff have a clear duty to benefit patients and avoid harming them, in practice almost all medical actions run the risk of harming the patient and in some no good effect can be achieved without a clearly harmful process (such as mastectomy or chemotherapy for breast cancer). Therefore all medical professionals should learn how to make a riskbenefit analysis at each point of care. The risk of harm should be explained to patients and their agreement obtained at each appropriate point. Professional blame or litigation may result if this is not done and harm results. See also PRIMUM NON NOCERE; PROFESSIONALISM.
