- (LE) a chronic inflammatory autoimmune disease of connective tissue, affecting the skin and various internal organs (systemic LE, SLE). Typically, there is a red butterfly-shaped rash on the face, over the cheek and bridge of the nose (butterfly rash); arthritis; and progressive damage to the kidneys. Often the heart, lungs, and brain are also affected by progressive attacks of inflammation followed by the formation of scar tissue (fibrosis). In a milder form, known as discoid LE (DLE), only the skin is affected. LE is an autoimmune disease and can be diagnosed by the presence of abnormal antibodies in the bloodstream. The disease is treated with corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs.
