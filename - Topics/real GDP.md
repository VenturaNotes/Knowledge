## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- It's a measure of the total value of all goods and services produced within a country, adjusted for inflation.
- It provides a more accurate representation of [[economic growth]] and the standard of living by accounting for changes in prices over time, allowing for meaningful comparisons across different time periods
## Source[^2]
- Gross domestic product divided by a suitable price index, to express it in real terms. The price index used for this purpose is usually the GDP deflator; since this covers the prices of investment goods and government purchases as well as consumer expenditure, it is more suitable than the retail price index.
