## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A polymer (see Feature entry) in which some of the constituent units are either ions or can readily be ionized. Examples of polyelectrolytes are DNA and polypeptides. The ions can be anions, cations, or both. Polyelectrolytes can be dissolved in water and electrolysis can be applied to such a solution. The theoretical analysis of polyelectrolytes is somewhat different from that of ordinary polymers because of the electric charges in a polyelectrolyte.
