- An n-channel metal oxide semiconductor (NMOS) is a circuit used for logic and memory chips. Companies use these chips to store data and process code. NMOS devices come with an insulating layer of metallic oxide such as silicon dioxide. Businesses might use an NMOS because it's faster than another semiconductor called a p-channel metal oxide semiconductor (PMOS). Users can also put more NMOS devices on a single chip.
