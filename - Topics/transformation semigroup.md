- A semigroup consisting of a collection $C$ of transformations of a set $S$ into itself (see FUNCTION), the dyadic operation $\circ$ being the composition of functions; it is essential that the set $C$ should be closed with respect to composition, i.e. if $c_{1}$ and $c_{2}$ are in $C$ then so is $c_{1} \circ c_{2}$.
- If the identity transformation (see IDENTITY FUNCTION) is included in the transformation semigroup, a [[transformation monoid]] results. Every monoid is isomorphic to a transformation monoid.
