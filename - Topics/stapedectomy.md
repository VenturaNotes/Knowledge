- $n$. surgical removal of the third ear ossicle (stapes), enabling it to be replaced with a prosthetic bone in the treatment of otosclerosis. A modification of this procedure involves creating a small hole in the base (footplate) of the stapes using a microdrill or laser, rather than completely removing the stapes. This allows insertion of the prosthesis through the hole and is referred to as stapedotomy. Most surgeons consider this procedure to be safer than stapedectomy.
