- $n$. A form of psychotherapy, used especially to treat hypochondriasis or somatic symptom disorder. It begins with 4-7 days of absolute bed rest without reading, talking, or other active pursuits, to be followed by a programme of progressively difficult or demanding work, usually in a communal setting. It is based on Buddhist beliefs and the concept of mindfulness. \[Named after the Japanese psychiatrist Shoma Morita (1874-1938) who originated it]
