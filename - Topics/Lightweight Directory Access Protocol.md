- LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) An application layer protocol (see SEVEN-LAYER REFERENCE MODEL) to query and control X500 directory services on a TCP/IP network. It was developed in the early 1990s as an alternative to the X500 Directory Access Protocol, being 'lightweight' in the sense that it that did not require an open systems interconnection protocol stack. The current version is LDAPv3, defined in RFC 4510.

## Source[^2]
- Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) locates data about organizations and individuals by searching data directories within a network over the internet. LDAP is a simpler version of the Directory Access Protocol because it requires less code. Organizations most commonly use LDAP to validate usernames and passwords. The protocol does this by authenticating information stored in directories.
