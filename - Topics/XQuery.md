- A language for extracting and combining data from one or more XML documents. It uses XPath as a sublanguage to isolate specific nodes (elements, attributes, character data, etc.), which can then be manipulated. Its functionality overlaps that of XSLT (see XSL), although its origins and purpose are different.
