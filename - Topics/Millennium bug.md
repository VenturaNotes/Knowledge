- The problem faced by computer users when the year 2000 (y2k) was reached. Many accounting and database applications had, for years, used only two digits to represent the year in a date; i.e. they would use 31.12.99 to represent 31 December 1999. This would obviously give incorrect follow-on dates for 01.01.00, and incorrect sorting of records in date order. Another problem involved the BIOS giving incorrect dates after 31.12.99. A considerable amount of money and time was spent by companies preparing for [[year 2000|y2k]] . Most problems were solved by new software issues or by patches to existing software, and the major disruption that many had predicted did not materialize.
