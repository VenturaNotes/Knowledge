- (DB scheme) An occupational pension scheme in which the rules specify the benefits to be received on retirement and the scheme is funded accordingly. The benefits are normally calculated on a formula incorporating years of service and salary levels (see FINAL SALARY SCHEME). Accounting for pension costs poses a number of difficulties for accountants; the basic regulations are set out in International Accounting Standard 19, Employee Benefits and Section 28 of the new Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
- In recent years rising costs have led many companies to close their existing DB schemes to new employees, who are obliged to join defined-contribution pension schemes.
