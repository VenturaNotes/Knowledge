- Google Trends is an online search tool that allows its users to see the frequency in which specific keywords, phrases, and subjects have been searched for on Google over a specific period of time.
- Google Trends analyzes a portion of Google searches and computes the amount of searches yielded by the term(s) entered. The program then compares the amount of searches yielded relative to the total number of Google searches placed during the same time period. These results are displayed on a search volume index graph that can be exported into a spreadsheet application for later use.
- Search engine marketers often use Google Trends to help them cater their content to search engines, with the goal of increasing the chances that their content lands on the first page of Google's search results.
