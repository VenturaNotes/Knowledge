- An access method for data files, supporting both sequential access and indexed access (see INDEXED FILE), and based on primary indexes that are structured as $\mathrm{B}+$ trees (see $\mathrm{B}\textendash\mathrm{TREE}$ ). It is specific to IBM machines and operating systems using virtual memory techniques, and improves on ISAM.
