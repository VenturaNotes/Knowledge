- Web Access Management (WAM) creates security for web-based business tools and applications. Historically, WAM systems focused on cybercriminals. However, SMBs now invest in these tools to prevent unauthorized access to applications from employees as well. Common features of WAM systems include:
	- Role-based access controls that limit employees from accessing specific apps or app features
	- Assignment of administrative functions to specific users within an organization
	- Self-service password reset that further protects organizations
	- Automated fulfillment of access requests
