- Any monadic operation $f$ that satisfies the law$$f(f(a))=a$$for all $a$ in the domain of $f$. The law is known as the involution law. It is satisfied by the elements of a Boolean algebra where the monadic function is the process of taking a complement. Taking complements of sets and negation in its different forms also satisfy the law, as does the principle of duality as it applies in Boolean algebras.
