- Free cooling (economizers) is a method used to reduce energy costs by harnessing the natural power of outside air or water without using mechanical means. It's typically done by using heat exchangers that transfer cold air inside airplane hangers, computer rooms, or industrial facilities where it is needed most. This type of technology can be used in many different ways depending on the building you're dealing with and how much space is available for installation purposes.
