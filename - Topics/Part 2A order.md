- (in England) a legal order made by a magistrate on application by the local authority, in accordance with The Health Protection (Part 2A Orders) Regulations 2010, to exercise powers over a person, place, or thing that presents a risk to public health for a period of up to 28 days. Typically, fewer than ten such orders are issued annually. They may be used, for example, to detain an individual with infectious drug-resistant tuberculosis against their will in a setting with appropriate infection-control measures, or to seize equipment used by unregistered tattooists with poor infection-control practices.
