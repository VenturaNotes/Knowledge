- $n$. A small gyrus running transversely across the superior temporal gyrus (temporal operculum) on the upper surface of each temporal lobe immediately in front of the planum temporale. It is occupied by the primary auditory cortex and arranged in isofrequency stripes, each stripe responding to a particular tonal frequency, both ears being represented in each cerebral hemisphere because of incomplete crossing of the auditory nerve fibres. \[Named after the Austrian pathologist Richard Ladislas Heschl (1824-81)]
