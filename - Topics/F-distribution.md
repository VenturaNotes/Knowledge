- F-distribution (Snedekor's F-distribution) A continuous distribution described by the probability density function$$f(x)=\frac{\Gamma\left(\frac{p+q}{2}\right)}{\Gamma\left(\frac{p}{2}\right) \Gamma\left(\frac{q}{2}\right)}\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)^{p / 2} \frac{x^{\frac{p}{2}-1}}{\left(1+\frac{p}{q} x\right)^{(p+q) / 2}}, 0<x<\infty$$where $p$ and $q$ are the degrees of freedom. Its moment-generating function does not exist. This distribution is used, for example, in finite sample inference in a linear regression model under the assumption that the underlying random error has normal distribution. For large $q,(p F)$ has asymptotically chi-square distribution with $p$ degrees of freedom.
