- A mainstream notebook is a type of laptop designed for general use. This includes tasks like web browsing, word processing, and watching videos. Mainstream notebooks typically have lower specs than gaming or workstation laptops, making them more affordable. This also means they don't perform as well at gaming or other intensive tasks.
