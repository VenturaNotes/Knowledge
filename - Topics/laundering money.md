- Processing money acquired illegally (as by theft, drug dealing, etc.) so that it appears to have come from a legitimate source. This may be achieved by paying the illegal cash into a foreign bank and transferring its equivalent to a bank with a good name in a hard-currency area. There are now stringent controls on this activity.
