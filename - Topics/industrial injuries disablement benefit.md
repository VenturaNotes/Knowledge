- a state benefit payable to a person disabled by injury or a prescribed industrial disease sustained or contracted in the course of employment (see OCCUPATIONAL DISEASE; PRESCRIBED DISEASE). The benefit is payable as a weekly amount. The amount of the benefit depends on the degree of disablement as determined following assessment by a specialist. To be entitled to benefit, the disablement must be assessed as being at least $20 \%$ of total disability ( $1 \%$ in the case of pneumoconiosis, byssinosis, and diffuse mesothelioma). The benefit is payable if the claimant is still suffering disability two months or more after the date of the accident or onset of the disease. It is payable for a period assessed as the time for which the claimant is likely to suffer the disability. The assessment can be reviewed if the claimant's condition deteriorates or if he or she is still disabled at the end of the period of assessment.
