## Source [^1]
- (symbol: M) A prefix indicating a multiple of one million $\left(10^{6}\right)$, as in megahertz and megawatt. When the binary number system is used in a structure or process (as in semiconductor RAM or ROM), the prefix then indicates a multiple of $2^{20}$, i.e. $1,048,576$, as in [[megabyte]] or megabit. The context usually clarifies which meaning is intended, although being numerically close the meanings are often considered more or less equivalent. See also BINARY PREFIXES.
