- Employee advocacy is the promotion of a company or brand by its own employees. Today, businesses often ask their employees to champion their brand or product/service offerings to help increase awareness as well as bottom line. Employees can share their companyâ€™s promotions or launches, advocate its work culture, or even make product or service recommendations to family and friends. However, the likelihood of an employee advocating for their company is often related to the degree of employee engagement within their organization. For instance, if an employee is subjected to a toxic workplace, they are less likely to become an employee advocate.
