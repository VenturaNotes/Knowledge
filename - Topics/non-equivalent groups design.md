- $n$. A quasi-experimental research design in which the investigator does not manipulate the independent variable but compares existing groups that differ on it. In this research design, the groups may differ in many other ways apart from the independent variable being investigated, and this limits the confidence with which the results can be attributed to the independent variable. See also ONE-GROUP PRETEST-POSTTEST DESIGN, INTERRUPTED TIME-SERIES DESIGN.
