- (concealed unemployment) Unemployment that does not appear in government statistics, which are usually based on figures for those drawing unemployment benefit (since 1996 known as jobseeker's allowance in the UK). In addition to these people there will be some who are doing very little productive work, although they are not registered as unemployed. These include workers on short time for whom their employers are expecting to be able to provide work shortly; workers who are not usefully employed, although their employers think they are; people who are not in full-time work but who do not qualify for the jobseeker's allowance for various reasons (including those drawing alternative benefits, such as income support or incapacity benefit); and others who choose not to claim benefit. See also RESIDUAL UNEMPLOYMENT.

- Unemployment of potential workers that is not captured in official unemployment statistics. Many countries count as unemployed only those without work who are actively looking for work. Potential workers who have abandoned the search for work, taken early retirement as an alternative to unemployment, or chosen to register as out of work for medical reasons, are not officially unemployed.
