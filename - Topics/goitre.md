- $n$. a swelling of the neck due to enlargement of the thyroid gland. This may be due to lack of dietary iodine, which is necessary for the production of thyroid hormone: the gland enlarges in an attempt to increase the output of hormone. This was the cause of endemic goitre, formerly common in regions where the diet lacked iodine. Sporadic goitre may be due to simple overgrowth (hyperplasia) of the gland or to a tumor. In exophthalmic goitre (Graves' disease) the swelling is associated with overactivity of the gland and is accompanied by other symptoms (see THYROTOXICOSIS). Autoimmune thyroiditis can be associated with goitre (see Hashimoto's DISEASE).

- Enlargement of the thyroid gland resulting in a swelling of the neck. This may be caused by lack of iodine in the diet (which is required for the production of thyroid hormones), as the gland enlarges to compensate for this deficiency; or by hyperthyroidism.
