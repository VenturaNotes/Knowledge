## Source[^2]
- Describing a type of cell signalling in which the signal molecule influences only the cell that produced it, by binding to receptors in or on itself. Autocrine signals are important in, e.g., embryonic development, tissue differentiation, inflammation, and wound healing; when disrupted, they can lead to the uncontrolled proliferation seen in tumour cells. Compare PARACRINE. See SIGNAL TRANSDUCTION.
