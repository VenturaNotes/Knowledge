## Source[^3]

All accessing and updating of the information will be via the facilities provided by this software as will be the recording of information on the log file, database recovery, and multiaccess control. 
- (2) Occasionally and colloquially, a collection of data on some subject however defined, accessed, and stored within a computer system. (This nontechnical use of the term can cause confusion to the nonspecialist as in: 'We don't use a database management system for our database, just straightforward VSAM files'.)
## Source[^4]
- An organized collection of information held on a computer. A special computer program, called a database management system (DBMS), is used to organize the information held in the database according to a specified schema, to update the information, and to help users find the information they seek. There are two kinds of DBMS: simple DBMS, which is the electronic equivalent of a card index; and programmable DBMS, which provides a programming language that allows the user to analyze the data held in the database. On large computer systems, other programs can generally communicate with the DBMS and use its facilities. The term data bank is used for a collection of databases. See also DATA WAREHOUSING; MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM.
