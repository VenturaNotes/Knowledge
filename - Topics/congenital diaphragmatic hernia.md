- (CDH) herniation of the fetal abdominal organs into the fetal chest, which occurs in one in 2000-5000 live births. This leads to pulmonary hypoplasia, which is the main cause of the associated high neonatal mortality. The risk of pulmonary hypoplasia is substantially greater where there is herniation of the liver into the thoracic cavity. CDH is commonly associated with additional structural abnormalities (cardiac, neural tube defects, and exomphalos), and the risk of chromosomal abnormality (aneuploidy) is 10-20%. Demonstration of a fluid-filled bowel at the level of the heart on ultrasound is diagnostic.
