- Any of a class of antimicrobial peptides produced by animals and plants as a means of innate defence against invading microorganisms. They act by disrupting the cell membranes of bacteria and fungi, thereby killing the target cell. In mammals they may also modulate inflammation and other immune responses. The similar structures of defensins in plants and animals suggests that they evolved before these two lineages diverged. See HYPERSENSITIVITY (sense 2).
