- any technique that produces an image in the form of a section through the body with the structures cut across. The main techniques are ultrasonography, computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and some nuclear medicine techniques (see POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; SPECT SCANNING). If a series of thin-section images is stacked they can be 'cut' through to show other planes or allow reconstruction of three-dimensional images.
