- $n$. a surgical procedure to prevent or treat rectal prolapse. An abdominal rather than a perineal approach is used. The rectum is mobilized into its normal pelvic position and internally fixed to the sacrum and anterior structures using sutures and mesh. Rectopexy may be combined with the removal of a small section of large bowel (resection rectopexy).
