- Analytics and business intelligence (ABI) is a catchall term for the applications, infrastructure, tools, and best practices that help organizations make smarter use of their data. The terms business intelligence and analytics are often used interchangeably, but the difference can be understood as descriptive versus predictive, respectively. Business intelligence identifies and explains trends, while analytics is concerned with predicting future events and making better business decisions. The wide variety of ABI tools on the market allows even non-technical users to perform in-depth data analysis.
