- a screening tool for alcoholism, widely used in hospitals, primary care, and psychiatric services. The name derives from an acronym of its four questions: (1) Have you ever felt you needed to cut down on your drinking? (2) Have people annoyed you by criticizing your drinking? (3) Have you ever felt guilty about drinking? (4) Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning (eye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover? A CAGE test score of two or more yes answers indicates a reasonably high likelihood of alcohol problems.
