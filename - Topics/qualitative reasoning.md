- An artificial intelligence approach in which precise numerical quantities are avoided in favor of symbolic qualitative values. Variables take values from a quantity space, e.g. {high, low, zero}, and are processed by various qualitative calculi. Based on intuitive ideas about human reasoning (see IMPRECISION), this formalism is proving valuable in modelling and reasoning about problems in diagnosis, process control, system verification, and explanation.
