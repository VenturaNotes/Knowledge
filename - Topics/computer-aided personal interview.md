- (CAPI) A method of interviewing in which researchers use laptop computers to conduct personal interviews and transmit the resulting data over the Internet. This dramatically reduces the time of the research process. It also allows on-screen presentation of stimuli to the respondent, reduces respondent fatigue, helps generate good-quality data, and allows fast collation of data from different geographical locations.
