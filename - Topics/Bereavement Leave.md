- Bereavement leave is a type of leave that employees can take when someone they know—generally a close relative—has died. The time means that the bereaved employee can mourn and also take care of any necessary arrangements. Businesses may define “close relative” differently and the length of bereavement leave also differs. Some companies may offer ten days and include close friends. Others will limit it to fathers, mothers, siblings, and spouses and only provide two or three days.
