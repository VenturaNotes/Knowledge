- The termination of an employee's contract of employment in a manner that is not in accordance with that contract. Thus when an employee is dismissed without the correct notice entitlement (in circumstances that do not justify summary dismissal) or when the employer prematurely terminates the employee's fixed-term contract, the employee is entitled to claim damages in the courts for wrongful dismissal. The court's jurisdiction concerns only the parties' contractual rights and not their statutory rights under the employment protection legislation (compare UNFAIR DISMISSAL). The Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act 1978 empowers the Secretary of State for Employment to give industrial tribunals jurisdiction to hear claims of wrongful dismissal.
