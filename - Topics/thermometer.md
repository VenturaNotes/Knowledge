- $n$. a device for registering temperature. A clinical thermometer consists of a sealed narrow-bore glass tube with a bulb at one end. It contains mercury, which expands when heated and rises up the tube. The tube is calibrated in degrees, and is designed to register temperatures between $35^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(95^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$ and $43.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\left(110^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$. An oral thermometer is placed in the mouth; a rectal thermometer is inserted into the rectum.
