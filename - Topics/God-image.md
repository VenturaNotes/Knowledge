- n. In analytical psychology, an image of God that, when it appears spontaneously in a dream or fantasy, symbolizes the self. Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) borrowed this term from medieval Christian theology, in which the Latin version imago Dei (image of God) was believed to be imprinted on the human soul.
