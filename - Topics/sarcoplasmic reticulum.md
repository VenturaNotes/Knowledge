## Source [^1]
- an arrangement of membranous vesicles and tubules found in the cytoplasm of striated muscle fibers. The sarcoplasmic reticulum plays an important role in the transmission of nervous excitation to the contractile parts of the fibers.
## Source[^2]
- The specialized endoplasmic reticulum found in the fibers of skeletal and cardiac muscle, which forms a network of membrane-lined cavities surrounding the contractile myofibrils that run through the fibers. The release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum into the cytosol following stimulation from an action potential (see TRANSVERSE TUBULES) causes subsequent contraction of the myofibrils (see SARCOMERE). The calcium ions are immediately returned to the sarcoplasmic reticulum by calcium ion pumps in the membrane.
