## Source [^1]
- The use of computational models to simulate the decisions and interaction of individual agents within an economic environment. Typically, the agents are consumers and firms who maximize utility and profit respectively. The individual decisions taken in a period determine the pay-off for each agent in that period, and imply the environment in which decisions are taken in the next period. The models are popular for tracing the evolution of a system over time and exploring how this evolution is affected by changes in underlying parameters.
