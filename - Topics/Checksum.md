## Source[^1]
- Checksum value in a UDP datagram computed using a checksum algorithm which is typically a [[16-bit one's complement checksum]]
- For computation
	- data payload and UDP header combined and the checksum algorithm calculates a value based on the binary representation of the combined data.
- Sender includes checksum in UDP header and receiver recalculates the checksum using the received data to verify its integrity. If calculated checksum matches the one in the header, the data is assumed to be intact
- The inclusion of checksums in headers varies among protocols
	- UDP includes a checksum in its header for error detection
	- TCP also includes checksums but incorporates error recovery mechanisms
