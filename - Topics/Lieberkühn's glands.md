- (crypts of Lieberkühn) simple tubular glands in the mucous membrane of the intestine. In the small intestine they lie between the villi. They are lined with columnar epithelium in which various types of secretory cells are found. In the large intestine Lieberkühn's glands are longer and contain more mucus-secreting cells. \[J. N. Lieberkühn (1711-56), German anatomist]
