- the volume of blood pumped from the heart's left ventricle divided by body surface area, expressed as litres per minute per square metre $\left(1 / \mathrm{min} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$. It is determined by heart rate and stroke volume index (the volume of blood pumped by the heart with each beat), and provides a normal range $\left(2.5-4.0 \mathrm{~l} / \mathrm{min} / \mathrm{m}^{2}\right)$ regardless of the size of the patient.
