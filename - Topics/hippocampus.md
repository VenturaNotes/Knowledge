## Synthesis
### Description
- located in the medial temporal lobe of brain
- Function primarily related to memory formation and consolidation of olfactory experiences. 
- Smells can trigger memories or emotions through the amygdala's connection to the hippocampus.Fun
## Source[^1]
- Best known for its role in memory.

- $n$. a swelling in the floor of the lateral ventricle of the brain. It contains complex foldings of cortical tissue and is involved, with other connections of the hippocampal formation, in the workings of the limbic system. $\textemdash$hippocampal adj.
## Source[^3]
- (pl. hippocampi) A part of the vertebrate brain consisting of two ridges, one over each of the two lateral ventricles. Part of the limbic system, it is highly developed in advanced mammals (primates and whales) and its function is concerned with forming new memories$\textemdash$by encoding information about events, people, places, etc. so that it can be stored as long-term declarative memory elsewhere in the brain.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. A phylogenetically primitive structure in the limbic system of the brain, folded into the inner surface of each temporal lobe between the thalamus and the main part of the cerebral cortex, having a cross-section shaped like a sea horse, involved in emotion, motivation, navigation by cognitive maps, learning, and the consolidation of longterm memory (only declarative memory and not procedural memory). The entire hippocampal formation consists of Ammon's horn (the hippocampus proper) together with the subiculum and the dentate gyrus.
