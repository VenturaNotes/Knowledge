- a branched stone forming a cast of the collecting system of the kidney and therefore filling the calyces and pelvis. The stone is usually associated with infected urine, the commonest organism being Proteus vulgaris. The combination of obstruction and infection can cause pyonephrosis and, if neglected, a perinephric abscess. Treatment involves a percutaneous nephrolithotomy.
