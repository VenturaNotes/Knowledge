- An employee who is employed for a specified period or for a specific task. Under the Fixed-term Employees (Prevention of Less Favourable Treatment) Regulations 2002, they are entitled to be treated no less favourably than permanent employees if they are doing the same or similar work. It is open to the employer to justify less favourable treatment if good reason can be shown. Under new regulations implemented in 2010 temporary workers who are not employees are likewise entitled to equal treatment if they have worked for a company for 12 consecutive weeks or longer. See also AGENCY WORKER; CONTINGENT WORKER.
