- A voice response system (VRS) is used on phone or fax lines via which callers can issue vocal commands. The system is built to recognize these commands. In doing so, the VRS can help users navigate a phone tree and be directed to the appropriate department. It can also be used to potentially answer simple inquiries in an automated fashion.
