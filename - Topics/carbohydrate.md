## Source [^1]
- $n$. any one of a large group of compounds, including the sugars and starch, that contain carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen and have the general formula $\mathrm{C}_{x}\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{y}$. Carbohydrates are important as a source of energy: they are manufactured by plants and obtained by animals from the diet, being one of the three main constituents of food (see also FAT; PROTEIN). All carbohydrates are eventually broken down in the body to the simple sugar glucose, which can then take part in energy-producing metabolic processes. Excess carbohydrate, not immediately required by the body, is stored in the liver and muscles in the form of glycogen. In plants carbohydrates are important structural materials (e.g. cellulose) and storage products (commonly in the form of starch). See also DISACCHARIDE; MONOSACCHARIDE; POLYSACCHARIDE.
