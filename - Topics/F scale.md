- $n$. A questionnaire to measure authoritarianism, first published by the German philosopher, sociologist, and psychologist Theodor W(iesengrund) Adorno (1903-69) and several colleagues in the book The Authoritarian Personality (1950). It is composed of the following nine aspects, typical items being shown in italics, and a Yes answer always indicating a tendency to authoritarianism. Conventionalism (rigid adherence to conventional middle-class values): Obedience and respect for authority are the most important virtues children should learn; Authoritarian Submission (a submissive and uncritical attitude towards authority figures): Young people sometimes get rebellious ideas, but as they grow up they ought to get over them and settle down; Authoritarian Aggression (a punishing attitude towards violations of conventional values): Sex crimes, such as rape and attacks on children, deserve more than mere imprisonment; such criminals ought to be publicly whipped, or worse; Anti-Intraception (a dislike of subjectivity and imagination): When a person has a problem or worry, it is best for him not to think about it, but to keep busy with more cheerful things; Superstition and Stereotypy (a belief in supernatural determinants of human fate and a tendency to think in rigid categories): Some day it will probably be shown that astrology can explain a lot of things; Power and Toughness (a preoccupation with strong/weak, leader/follower relationships): People can be divided into two distinct classes: the weak and the strong; Destructiveness and Cynicism (a distrustful and misanthropic attitude towards people in general): Human nature being what it is, there will always be war and conflict; Projectivity (a tendency to project one's own unconscious impulses on to others): Homosexuals are hardly better than criminals and ought to be severely punished; Sex (exaggerated concern with people's sexual activities): The wild sex life of the old Greeks and Romans was tame compared to some of the goings-on in this country, even in places where people might least expect it. Also called the California $F$ scale. \[From (Potentiality for) $F($ascism) scale]
