## Synthesis
- A substance that has the ability to dissolve other substances (called solutes), to create a solution.
## Source[^1]
- There is usually some interaction between the solvent and solute molecules. For example, when sodium chloride dissolves in water the sodium ions attract polar water molecules, with the negative oxygen ion pointing towards the positive $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ion. This is called hydration.
