- n. 
- (1) an eating away of surface tissue by physical or chemical processes, including those associated with inflammation. In the skin, an erosion represents a superficial type of ulceration and therefore heals quite readily. 
- (2) (in dentistry) loss of non-carious tooth surface, usually caused by repeated application of acid, which softens the enamel. It may result from excessive intake of fruit juice, carbonated drinks, or acidic fruits or by regurgitation of acid from the stomach, as in bulimia nervosa, hiatus hernia, alcoholism, or stress (see GASTRO-OESOPHAGEAL REFLUX DISEASE). The teeth become very sensitive. The aetiology should be identified and corrected; severe cases may require extensive dental restorations.
