- Two or more series of non-stationary random variables are cointegrated if there exists a stationary linear combination of these variables. Cointegrated series share a common stochastic trend. More formally, if series $X$ and $Y$ are both integrated of order $b$, denoted $I(b)$, and $Z$ $=Y-\beta X$ is $I(d)$ with $d<b$ for some constant $\beta$, then $X$ and $Y$ are cointegrated with the order of cointegration $(b-d)$; if $(b-d)$ is a fraction then $X$ and $Y$ are fractionally cointegrated.
