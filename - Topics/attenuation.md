## Source [^1]
- The reduction in amplitude of a signal when it passes through a medium that dissipates its energy. It is usually measured in decibels (attenuation then being negative while gain is positive).
## Source[^2]
- Attenuation is a general term that refers to any reduction in the strength of a signal.
## Source[^3]
- Attenuation is a decline in signal transmission strength between a source and destination. Attenuation is measured in decibels and specifically discusses the current, voltage, or power of a signal. The more attenuation, the more chippy and less coherent a transmitted signal becomes. This may happen due to interference, loss of power, or poorly functioning equipment.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. reduction of the disease-producing ability (virulence) of a bacterium or virus by chemical treatment, heating, drying, by growing under adverse conditions, or by passing through another organism. Treated (attenuated) bacteria or viruses are used for many immunizations.

## Source[^5]
- (1) (in medicine) A process of reducing the disease-producing ability of a microorganism. It can be achieved by chemical treatment, heating, drying, irradiation, by growing the organism under adverse conditions, or by serial passage through another organism. Attenuated bacteria or viruses are used for some vaccines. 
- (2) (in mycology) The conversion by yeasts of carbohydrates to alcohol, as in brewing and wine and spirit production. 
- (3) (in genetics) A mechanism for regulating gene expression in prokaryotes, observed especially in functional gene clusters (operons), such as the trp genes that encode enzymes responsible for synthesizing tryptophan in E. coli bacteria. Attenuation comes into play when the product of the enzymes (in this case tryptophan) is present to excess in the medium; transcription of the operon is drastically reduced, perhaps by as much as $90 \%$ of the maximum rate. This attenuation is caused by formation of stem-loop structures in the initial part of the RNA transcript, encoded by the trpL gene upstream of the structural genes. These RNA structures either allow transcription to proceed past the trpL gene or cause termination, depending on available concentrations of tryptophan transfer RNA, and hence tryptophan.
