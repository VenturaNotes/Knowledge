## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The reduction in amplitude of a signal when it passes through a medium that dissipates its energy. It is usually measured in decibels (attenuation then being negative while gain is positive).
## Source[^2]
- Attenuation is a general term that refers to any reduction in the strength of a signal.
## Source[^3]
- Attenuation is a decline in signal transmission strength between a source and destination. Attenuation is measured in decibels and specifically discusses the current, voltage, or power of a signal. The more attenuation, the more chippy and less coherent a transmitted signal becomes. This may happen due to interference, loss of power, or poorly functioning equipment.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. reduction of the disease-producing ability (virulence) of a bacterium or virus by chemical treatment, heating, drying, by growing under adverse conditions, or by passing through another organism. Treated (attenuated) bacteria or viruses are used for many immunizations.
