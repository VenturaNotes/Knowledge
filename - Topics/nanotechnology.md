- $n$. a field of science focused on matter 100 nm or smaller (a DNA double helix has a diameter around 2 nm ). Such substances (e.g. nanoparticles, nanostructures, nanocrystals) include those at the molecular and atomic levels. Nanomedicine is the use of nanotechnology to deliver diagnostic or treatment modalities (e.g. drugs) directly to the relevant cells (e.g. cancer cells) in the human body.
## Source[^2]
- The development and use of devices that have a size of only a few nanometres. Research has been carried out into very small components, which depend on electronic effects and may involve movement of a countable number of electrons in their action. Such devices would act much faster than larger components. Considerable interest has been shown in the production of structures on a molecular level by suitable sequences of chemical reactions. It is also possible to manipulate individual atoms on surfaces using a variant of the atomic force microscope.
