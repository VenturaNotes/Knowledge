- (DIC) a condition resulting from overstimulation of the blood-clotting mechanisms in response to disease or injury, such as severe infection, malignancy, acute leukaemia, burns, severe trauma, or severe haemorrhage during childbirth (see also ABRUPTIO PlACENTAE). The overstimulation results in generalized blood coagulation and excessive consumption of coagulation factors. The resulting deficiency of these may lead to spontaneous bleeding. Transfusions of fresh frozen plasma, platelets, and cryoprecipitate are given along with blood to replace the depleted clotting factors; treatment of the underlying cause is essential.
