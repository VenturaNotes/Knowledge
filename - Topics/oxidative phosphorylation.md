## Source [^1]
- A reaction occurring during the final stages of aerobic respiration, in which ATP is formed from ADP and phosphate coupled to electron transport in the electron transport chain. The reaction occurs in the mitochondria (see CHEMIOSMOTIC MECHANISM) and is the cell's principal method of storing the energy released by the oxidation of food. See also PHOSPHORYLATION; P/O RATIO.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. The process whereby energy released by oxidation is used to synthesize the energy-storing molecule ATP. Also called oxidative metabolism. See also Krebs cycle. \[From oxidation + phosphorus, alluding to the fact that ATP is a phosphate, + -ation indicating an action, process, state, condition, or result]
