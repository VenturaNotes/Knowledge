## Source [^1]
- A programming language with the control structures of the typical high-level language (if-then, while-do, etc.), whose data types and structures map onto the underlying machine architecture. Thus such a language will allow variables of type bit, byte, word, etc. These languages, also known simply as machine-oriented languages, provide an alternative to assembly language for systems programming at the hardware-interface level. Well-known examples are Babbage and PL/360. MOHLLs are now largely replaced by the language C. Compare PROBLEM-ORIENTED LANGUAGE.
