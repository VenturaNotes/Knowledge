## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The entire complement of proteins synthesized by a cell or organism at a given time. This can be determined by analyzing protein constituents of cell contents using such techniques as gel electrophoresis, high-throughput liquid chromatography, microarrays, and mass spectrometry, coupled with automated database searching to identify proteins. A complementary approach is to infer the potential proteome from analysis of the genome (see GENOMICS). However, unlike the genome, the proteome is constantly changing due to the influence of intracellular and extracellular factors. See PROTEOMICS.
