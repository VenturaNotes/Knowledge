- The value of an organization when its liabilities have been deducted from the value of its assets. Often taken to be synonymous with net assets, net worth so defined can be misleading in that balance sheets rarely show the real value of assets. See BOOK VALUE.
## Source[^2]
- The net value of an organization's assets, after deducting any liabilities. Net worth can only be measured reliably if assets are correctly valued: this cannot usually be done simply by using balance-sheet figures. Where assets are not readily marketed and intangible assets such as goodwill are important, a figure for net worth can be unreliable.
