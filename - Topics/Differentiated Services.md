## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A mechanism used to classify and manage network traffic by assigning different priorities to different types of data packets, essentially allowing for better [[Quality of Service]] (QoS) by giving preferential treatment to critical traffic like voice calls over less urgent data like web browsing
- Utilizes special field within the IP header to identify these classifications
### Key Points
- [[Packet prioritization]]: DS allows [[network administrator|network administrators]] to prioritize certain types of traffic by assigning different "[[Differentiated Service Code Points]]" (DSCPs) to packet, which routers then use to determine how to handle them
- QoS control: By prioritizing specific traffic types, DS can help ensure smoother delivery for time-sensitive data like real-time audio and video communication
- Flexibility: Unlike strict QoS mechanisms, DS provides a flexible approach to traffic management allowing different levels of priority to be assigned based on network needs
