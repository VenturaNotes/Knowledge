- (1) n. a drug that causes the pupil of the eye to contract by constricting the ciliary muscle (see CILIARY BODY). Miotics, such as pilocarpine, are used to reduce the pressure in the eye in the treatment of glaucoma: contraction of the ciliary muscle increases the angle between the iris and cornea through which aqueous humour drains from the eye. 
- (2) adj. showing miosis.
