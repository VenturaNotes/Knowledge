## Synthesis
- Beneath the cerebral hemispheres
- Play a role in certain aspects of memory and learning.
	- Functions related to memory include procedural memory, motor learning, and error correction 
- Might be involved in procedural memory, which is the memory of how to perform actions.

- $n$. the largest part of the hindbrain, bulging back behind the pons and the medulla oblongata and overhung by the occipital lobes of the cerebrum. Like the cerebrum, it has an outer grey cortex and a core of white matter. Three broad bands of nerve fibers - the inferior, middle, and superior cerebellar peduncles - connect it to the medulla, the pons, and the midbrain respectively. It has two hemispheres, one on each side of the central region (the vermis), and its surface is thrown into thin folds called folia (see illustration). Within lie four pairs of nuclei.

- The cerebellum is essential for the maintenance of muscle tone, balance, and the synchronization of activity in groups of muscles under voluntary control, converting muscular contractions into smooth coordinated movement. It does not, however, initiate movement and plays no part in the perception of conscious sensations or in intelligence. $\textemdash$cerebellar adj.

- (pl. cerebellums or cerebella) The part of the vertebrate brain concerned with the coordination and regulation of muscle activity and the maintenance of muscle tone and balance. In mammals it consists of two connected hemispheres, composed of a core of white matter and a much-folded outer cortex of grey matter containing numerous Purkyne cells, and it is situated above the medulla oblongata and partly beneath the cerebrum. In humans it also receives input from hearing and vision centers elsewhere in the brain, analyses visual signals associated with body movements, and estimates the time intervals between events or when performing movements, e.g. in hand-eye coordination.

- $n$. One of the main structures in the brain, situated at the back of the skull, behind the brainstem and beneath the back of the cerebrum, consisting of two deeply fissured lateral hemispheres separated by a narrow central girdle, the vermis, connected to the brainstem by three pairs of cerebellar peduncles. The vermis on the upper surface, containing an inverted topographic map of the body, is involved in trunk and eye movements; the intermediate zones and hemispheres on either side of the vermis, containing separate topographic maps (not inverted) of each side of the body, regulate limb movements by the same side; and the flocculonodular lobe, separated by a deep fissure from the base of the cerebellum, is concerned chiefly with posture, balance, and ballistic movements. Unlike the cerebral hemispheres, each hemisphere of the cerebellum is associated with the same side of the body. Lesions in the cerebellum produce deficits of movement and balance but do not affect sensory functions. See neOCerebellum, SPINOCEREbellum, VESTIBULOCEREBELLUM.
