## Synthesis
- Beneath the cerebral hemispheres
- Play a role in certain aspects of memory and learning.
	- Functions related to memory include procedural memory, motor learning, and error correction 
- Might be involved in procedural memory, which is the memory of how to perform actions.

- $n$. the largest part of the hindbrain, bulging back behind the pons and the medulla oblongata and overhung by the occipital lobes of the cerebrum. Like the cerebrum, it has an outer grey cortex and a core of white matter. Three broad bands of nerve fibres - the inferior, middle, and superior cerebellar peduncles - connect it to the medulla, the pons, and the midbrain respectively. It has two hemispheres, one on each side of the central region (the vermis), and its surface is thrown into thin folds called folia (see illustration). Within lie four pairs of nuclei.

- The cerebellum is essential for the maintenance of muscle tone, balance, and the synchronization of activity in groups of muscles under voluntary control, converting muscular contractions into smooth coordinated movement. It does not, however, initiate movement and plays no part in the perception of conscious sensations or in intelligence. $\textemdash$cerebellar adj.
## Source[^3]
- (pl. cerebellums or cerebella) The part of the vertebrate brain concerned with the coordination and regulation of muscle activity and the maintenance of muscle tone and balance. In mammals it consists of two connected hemispheres, composed of a core of white matter and a much-folded outer cortex of grey matter containing numerous Purkyne cells, and it is situated above the medulla oblongata and partly beneath the cerebrum. In humans it also receives input from hearing and vision centres elsewhere in the brain, analyses visual signals associated with body movements, and estimates the time intervals between events or when performing movements, e.g. in hand-eye coordination.
