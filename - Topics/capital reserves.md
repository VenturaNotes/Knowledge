- Part of the net assets of a company in excess of the share capital originally contributed by shareholders. Capital reserves may arise from the sale of new shares at a price above their par value, from retention of profits, from the revaluation of assets, or from capital gains made by a company. Normally, capital reserves are not distributable as dividends; this is in contrast to revenue reserves, which are available to maintain dividends in years of low current profits.
