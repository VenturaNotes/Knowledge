- The flow of goods and services across national frontiers without the interference of laws, tariffs, quotas, or other restrictions. Since World War II, under the auspices of GATT and the World Trade Organization, trade barriers have continuously, if slowly, fallen.

- A policy of unrestricted foreign trade, with no tariffs or subsidies on imports or exports, and no quotas or other trade restrictions. Free trade implies that this regime applies to most goods, though there may be exceptions, for example agricultural goods or military equipment. It has usually been interpreted as applying only to trade in goods and not in services, but a similar policy can be applied to trade in services. A free-trade policy can be adopted unilaterally, or on a multilateral basis by joining a free-trade area. This is a group of countries which have no tariffs or other restrictions on trade between them, but remain free to control their trade with non-members of the area. Again, this may apply to most but not all types of goods.
