- aka intrinsic equation
- A planar curve may be defined by use of intrinsic properties such as arc length $s$ (from some fixed point of the curve) and the angle $\uppsi$ that the curve's tangent makes (with a fixed direction). The curvature $\kappa$ then satisfies $\kappa = d\uppsi/ds$ and alternatively $\kappa$ and $s$ might be used to define the curve. For a curve in three dimensions, arc length, curvature, and torsion can be used.
