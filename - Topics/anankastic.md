- adj. describing a collection of longstanding personality traits in ICD-10 (see International Classification of Diseases), including stubbornness, meanness, an over-meticulous concern to be accurate in small details, a disposition to check things unnecessarily, severe feelings of insecurity about personal worth, and an excessive tendency to doubt evident facts. These traits, sometimes described as obsessional traits, can amount to a personality disorder if they are severe.
