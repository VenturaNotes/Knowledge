- A curve showing the relation between income level and consumption of some good, at a given price. In a diagram with consumption on the horizontal axis and income on the vertical, the Engel curve for a good with unit income elasticity of demand is a ray through the origin. The Engel curve for a necessity with less than unit income elasticity is steeper than a ray through the origin; and that for a luxury with more than unit income elasticity is flatter.
