## Source [^1]
- The formation of a layer of solid, liquid, or gas on the surface of a solid or, less frequently, of a liquid. There are two types depending on the nature of the forces involved. In chemisorption a single layer of molecules, atoms, or ions is attached to the adsorbent surface by chemical bonds. In physisorption adsorbed molecules are held by the weaker physical forces. The property is utilized in adsorption chromatography.
