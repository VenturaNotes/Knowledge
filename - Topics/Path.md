### Definition
- A sequence of vertices where vertices not repeated

## Source[^2]
- (1) A route between two vertices of a graph, passing along edges and, in the case of a directed graph, with attention paid to the direction along the edges. More formally there is a path between vertices $V_{0}$ and $V_{k}$ if each pair$$\left(V_{i}, V_{i+1}\right), i=0,1 \ldots, k-1$$is an edge of the graph and, in the case of a directed graph, is suitably directed.
- In typical applications, the existence of paths between vertices indicates physical connections between them or perhaps logical connections or dependencies. See also CYCLE. 
- (2) A sequence of instructions that may be performed in the execution of a program. A path through a program is equivalent to a traversal of the control-flow diagram for that program from the start node or vertex to the end node of the graph. 
- (3) See ACCESS PATH.
