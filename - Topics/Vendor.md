- A vendor (or seller) is a business selling a product or service. Vendors may design and manufacture their own products or sell products made by other manufacturers. They can also provide additional services, such as support, maintenance, and consulting, for their own products or those of third-party manufacturers. Vendors operate in almost all sectors. For example, a healthcare software vendor may provide a pharmaceutical firm with a healthcare management system. The same vendor may also move the pharmaceutical company's data to the new platform.
