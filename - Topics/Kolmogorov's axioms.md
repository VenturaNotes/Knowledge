- $n$. Four propositions about probabilities from which all major theorems can be derived: 
	- (1) the probability of any event is equal to or greater than zero; 
	- (2) the probability of a certain event is 1 ; 
	- (3) if $E$ and $F$ are two mutually exclusive events (events that cannot both occur), then the probability of the disjunction (the probabi-lity of either $E$ or $F$ occurring) is equal to the sum of their individual probabilities: $P(E$ or $F)=$ $P(E)+P(F)$; and 
	- (4) the probability of a conjunction of two events $E$ and $F$ (the probability that both $E$ and $F$ occur) is equal to the probability of $E$ assuming that $F$ occurs multiplied by the probability of $F:P(E\text{ and }F) = P(E|F)P(F)$. \[Named after the Russian mathematician Andrei Nikolaevich Kolmogorov (1903-87) who formulated them in 1933]
