## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (pentose shunt) A series of biochemical reactions that results in the conversion of glucose 6-phosphate to ribose 5-phosphate and generates NADPH, which provides reducing power for other metabolic reactions, such as synthesis of fatty acids. Ribose 5-phosphate and its derivatives are components of such molecules as ATP, coenzyme A, NAD, FAD, DNA, and RNA. In plants the pentose phosphate pathway also plays a role in the synthesis of sugars from carbon dioxide. In animals the pathway occurs at various sites, including the liver and adipose tissue.
