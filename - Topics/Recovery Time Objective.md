- Recovery time objective (RTO) is a term used to define the maximum timespan that a computer system, network, or program can be out of service after a system failure or disaster. To calculate a businessʻs RTO, IT administrators must identify which systems and programs within their organization are vital to keep daily operations up and running. RTOs help businesses determine how long their systems, networks, or programs can be down before negatively impacting an organizationʻs business operations.
