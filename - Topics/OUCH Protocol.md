- OUCH is a simple, low-level protocol that helps stock market participants connect to the Nasdaq Stock Market to buy and trade securities. The OUCH protocol uses a binary format instead of text format to transfer data regarding the Nasdaq Stock Market to trading systems, which takes up less bandwidth over an organization ªs network.
- This allows small financial firms to buy stock and receive purchase confirmation at an optimal rate, which is the key to winning trades before the stock market shifts. However, to use the OUCH protocol, stock market subscribers must obtain a OUCH protocol certificate or use an OUCH-certified application to purchase stock.
