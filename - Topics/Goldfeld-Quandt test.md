- A test for heteroscedasticity applicable when the observations can be ordered according to non-decreasing variance. The test is carried out by omitting $r$ central observations and running two separate ordinary least squares regressions on the first and the last $(N-r) / 2$ observations. Under the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity the test statistic, $G Q=S_{2} / S_{1}$, has an F-distribution, with degrees of freedom $p=q=$ $(N-r) / 2-K$. Here $S_{1}$ and $S_{2}$ are the sums of squared residuals from the first and the second test regressions, $N$ is the sample size, and $K$ is the number of explanatory variables in the main regression. The optimum value of $r$ is not known; $r \approx N / 3$ is frequently used.
