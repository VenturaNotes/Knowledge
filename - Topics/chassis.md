## Synthesis

- In general, a mechanical system that is designed to provide a supporting and/or enclosing medium for an item of electronic equipment. The system may be equipped with supporting structures to carry standard-sized circuit boards in addition to a motherboard or backplane into which the boards are inserted and connected via sockets. Alternatively the individual components may be hardwired onto tag strips attached to the chassis.
- For safety reasons the metal parts of most chassis are permanently connected to a local zero-voltage reference or ground. In some equipment, however, it is more convenient (but potentially dangerous) to connect the chassis to one side of the a.c. or d.c. line (mains) supply; the equipment is then said to have a hot (or live) chassis. The chassis may also be left unconnected or floating.
