- A fundamental statement of all programming languages (except declarative languages) that assigns a new value to a variable. The typical form in Algollike languages is

variable := expression

where $:=$ is read as 'becomes'; the symbol suggests a left-pointing arrow to signify the conveyance of a value to the variable on the left. Other languages (particularly Basic, C, C++, Java, and Fortran) use = as the assignment operator, e.g.

  

$$

\mathrm{a}=\mathrm{b}+\mathrm{c}

$$

  

This leads to problems in expressing the concept of equality. Basic, being an unsophisticated language, is able to use $=$ for both purposes; $\mathrm{C}, \mathrm{C}++$, and Java use $==$ for equality and Fortran uses .EQ.
