## Source [^1]
- the process by which nutrients are delivered to the gut through a feeding tube - a nasogastric tube, nasojejunal tube, a PEG tube (see GASTROSTOMY), or a jejunostomy tube. Polymeric feeds contain whole fats, protein, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals. Feeds that are easier to digest include peptide feeds (containing short protein chains instead of whole protein) and elemental feeds (containing amino acids rather than whole proteins).
