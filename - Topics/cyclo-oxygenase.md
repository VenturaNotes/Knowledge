- (COX; prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase) An enzyme that catalyses the key reactions in the formation of prostaglandins from arachidonic acid, linolenic acid, and eicosa-5,8,11,14,17-pentaenoic acid. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin and ibuprofen, inhibit the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes COX1 and COX2, thus blocking the synthesis of prostaglandins and related compounds, such as prostacyclins and thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$, and relieving the symptoms of fever, inflammation, and pain associated with them. Inhibition of COX1 by aspirin is the basis for its antithrombotic (blood-thinning) properties.
