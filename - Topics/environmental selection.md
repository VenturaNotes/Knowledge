- Natural selection within a population resulting from the influence exerted by the environment. Environmental selection inevitably leads to a change in the composition of genes within a population. For example, a change in the environment resulting in a drop in temperature will favor animals with an increased ability to maintain their body heat and may eventually result in a population of animals with denser fur.
