- An extensible markup language (XML) is a set of rules for encoding documents in a human-readable and machine-readable format. The WIPO Standard ST.96 and several other related standards define it, with continuous maintenance by ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC34â€”the ISO committee responsible for standardization in this area; see also Internationalization & Localization: Standards. While the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for serializing structured data as well.
