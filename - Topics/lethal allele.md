- (lethal gene) A mutant form of a gene that eventually results in the death of an organism if expressed in the phenotype. Most lethal genes are recessive; for example, sicklecell anaemia (see POLYMORPHISM) results from a recessive lethal gene that causes the production of abnormal and inefficient haemoglobin.
