## Synthesis
- A security approach that restricts access to a network based on predefined security policies
- It ensures that only authenticated and compliant devices can connect to the network such as ones with up-to-date antivirus software and proper configurations
- NAC can be used to prevent unauthorized users or comprised devices from accessing sensitive resources
## Source[^1]
- Network access control (NAC) enforces security policies on devices and for users that connect to an organization's computer system, in order to increase network visibility and reduce risk. NAC finds and identifies all wired and wireless devices that connect to the network. When a device is non-compliant, it's denied access, placed in quarantine, or given restricted access to keep the network secure.
