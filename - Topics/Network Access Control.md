- Network access control (NAC) enforces security policies on devices and for users that connect to an organization’s computer system, in order to increase network visibility and reduce risk. NAC finds and identifies all wired and wireless devices that connect to the network. When a device is non-compliant, it’s denied access, placed in quarantine, or given restricted access to keep the network secure.
