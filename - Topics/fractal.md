- A set whose Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension strictly exceeds its topological dimension. Intuitively, a fractal is a set which at all magnifications reveals a set that is exactly the same (self-similar). Such sets can be generated by the repeated application of some collection of maps. The term is generally associated with Benoit Mandelbrot and appeared in the literature in the late 1970s. Many naturally occurring objects, such as trees, coastlines, and clouds, are considered to have fractal properties, hence their interest to computer graphics.
