- Hardware and software maintenance services refer to a series of processes that test hardware, update operating systems and applications, and perform troubleshooting tactics in the event of bugs or subpar performance. These services can be performed in-house by a member of the IT team. However, many companies opt to outsource these services to experts familiar with the hardware and software that the organization uses. In these cases, companies can choose ongoing, regular contracts with service providers or an incident-based subscription that focuses more on troubleshooting when problems occur with the hardware or software systems.
