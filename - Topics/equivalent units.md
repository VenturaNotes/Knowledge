- (effective units) Unfinished units of production that remain in a process at the end of a period as work in progress (or process). Degrees of completion are assigned to each cost classification, which, when applied to the number of units in work in progress, give an equivalent number of completed units. For example, if the number of units of work in progress is, say, 3,000 units to the following degrees of completion, the effective units are given in the table overleaf. The equivalent units have an impact on the valuation of opening and closing work in process.
