- A contradiction originally formulated by Bertrand Russell and phrased in terms of set theory. Let $T$ be the set of all sets that are not members of themselves, i.e.$$T=\{S \mid S \notin S\}$$Then it can be shown that $T$ is a member of $T$ if and only if $T$ is not a member of $T$.
- The paradox results from certain kinds of recursive definitions. It arises for example in the following situation: the barber in a certain town shaves everyone who does not shave himself; who shaves the barber?
