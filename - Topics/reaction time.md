- (latent period) The period of time between the detection of a stimulus at a sensory receptor and the performance of the appropriate response by the effector organ. This delay is caused by the time taken for the impulse to travel across the synapses of adjacent neurons. The reaction time for a reflex response, involving only a single linking synapse, is very short.
