- A business strategy in which a large company or group of companies splits up so that its activities are carried on by two or more independent companies. Alternatively, subsidiaries of a group are sold off. Demerging was popular in the late 1980s when large conglomerates became unfashionable. One of the main reasons for demerging is to improve the value of the company's shares, particularly if one part of a group's value can be better reflected by a separate share quotation.
