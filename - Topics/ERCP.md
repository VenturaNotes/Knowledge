- (endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography) the technique in which a catheter is passed through a duodenoscope into the ampulla of Vater of the common bile duct and injected with a radiopaque medium to outline the pancreatic duct and bile ducts radiologically. Magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP; see CHOLANGIOGRAPHY) is often used to diagnose biliary and pancreatic disease followed by ERCP for diagnostic confirmation and therapeutic intervention. ERCP facilitates the removal of gallstones from the common bile duct, biopsy of lesions, and insertion of biliary stents. See also PAPILLOTOMY.
