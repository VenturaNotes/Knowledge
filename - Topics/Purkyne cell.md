- (Purkinje cell) A type of nerve cell large numbers of which are found in the cortex of the cerebellum. Purkyne cells are multipolar neurons having large bodies from which arise several dendrons with highly branched dendrites, which form a flat fan extending towards the surface of the cerebellum. They are named after the Czech physiologist J. E. Purkyne (1787-1869).
