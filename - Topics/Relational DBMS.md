- A relational database management system (RDBMS) stores data in rows and columns. Its architecture uses mathematical rules that allow users to create meaningful data relationships by joining tables containing those rows and columns. Users develop relationships between tables by comparing data. An RDBMS can take two or more tables and create a new table from any rows that satisfy established criteria. Most modern RDBMS handle various data types, including objects, native XML structures, and user-defined data types.
