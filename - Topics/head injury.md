- an injury usually resulting from a blow to the head and often associated with traumatic brain injury. It may result in contusion or $\textendash$ if the blood vessels in the head are torn $\textendash$ a haematoma. The level of consciousness of a patient following a head injury can be monitored using the Glasgow Coma Scale. Head injuries are an important cause of death due to accidents: legislation to impose protective headgear at industrial sites and on construction workers and motorcyclists has reduced their incidence.
