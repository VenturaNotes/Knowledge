- the stiffening of a body that occurs within some eight hours of death in temperate climates, due to chemical changes in muscle tissue. It usually starts to disappear after about 24 hours.
## Source[^2]
- The stiffening of the body of an animal after death, due to a temporary rigidity of the muscles. This condition arises because ATP, which is no longer synthesized after death, is required to break down the bridges that form between actin and myosin filaments in muscle tissue during contraction.
