- $n$. a group of closely linked genes that regulate the production of enzymes in bacteria. An operon is composed of one or more structural genes, which determine the nature of the enzymes made, and operator and promoter genes, which control the working of the structural genes. The operator is itself controlled by a regulator gene, which is not part of the operon.
