- A clustered system (or shared disk system) is a type of IT architecture that combines two or more computer systems. These systems might include uniprocessors, massively parallel processing (MPP) systems and symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) systems. All of these machines are independent of each other but work together and have shared access to disks. Each node in a clustered system contains cluster software, which monitors the system and makes sure it's working properly.
