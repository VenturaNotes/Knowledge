- chromatin found only in female cells and believed to represent a single $X$ chromosome in a nondividing cell. It can be used to discover the sex of a baby before birth by examination of cells obtained by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. There are two main kinds: (1) the Barr body, a small object that stains with basic dyes, found on the edge of the nucleus just inside the nuclear membrane; (2) a drumstick-like appendage to the nucleus in neutrophils (a type of white blood cell).
