- A jargon name for a trader in the financial markets who uses recurring patterns in the behavior of market variables over time to forecast their movements in the future. The name comes from the use of charts or graphs to show the past behavior of variables such as share prices. There is a large body of empirical evidence that shows past asset prices do not help to predict current prices, which leaves the methods of chartists without any empirical justification. See also FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS.
## Source[^2]
- An investment analyst who uses charts of prices and volumes in an attempt to predict what will happen in financial markets. Most chartist analysis is based on the assumption that history repeats itself and that the movements of share prices conform to a small number of repetitive patterns.
