- A jargon name for a trader in the financial markets who uses recurring patterns in the behavior of market variables over time to forecast their movements in the future. The name comes from the use of charts or graphs to show the past behavior of variables such as share prices. There is a large body of empirical evidence that shows past asset prices do not help to predict current prices, which leaves the methods of chartists without any empirical justification. See also FUNDAMENTAL ANALYSIS.
