- A functional form, named after its originators, that is widely used in theoretical and applied economics as both a production function and a utility function. Denote aggregate output by $Y$, the input of capital by $K$, and the input of labour by $L$. The Cobb-Douglas production function is then given by$$Y=A K^{\alpha} L^{\beta}$$where $A, \alpha$, and $\beta$ are positive constants. If $\alpha+\beta=1$ this function has constant returns to scale: if $K$ and $L$ are each multiplied by any positive constant $\lambda$ then $Y$ will also be multiplied by $\lambda$. The Cobb-Douglas production function has also been applied at the level of the individual firm. With this production function, a cost-minimizing firm will spend a proportion $\alpha$ of its total costs on capital and a proportion $\beta$ on labour. When the Cobb-Douglas function is applied as a utility function the inputs, $K$ and $L$, are replaced by the consumption levels of two types of good, say, $X$ and $Y$. With this utility function a utility-maximizing consumer will spend a proportion $\alpha$ of their budget on good $X$ and a proportion $\beta$ on good $Y$. The Cobb-Douglas function can also be extended to include three or more arguments.
