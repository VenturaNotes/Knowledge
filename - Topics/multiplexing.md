## Source [^1]
- It is a method networks use to consolidate multiple digital and analog signals into one. These signals are transported over a medium (like a [[Fiber optic cables|fiber optic cable]] or [[radio wave]])

## Source[^2]
- The process of combining multiple messages simultaneously on the same physical or logical transmission medium. There are two main types: time division multiplexing (TDM) and frequency division multiplexing (FDM). In TDM a device is allocated specific time slots in which to use the transmission medium. FDM divides the transmission medium into channels of smaller bandwidth to which the user has exclusive rights. FDM and TDM can be combined to provide devices with time slots of logical channels.
