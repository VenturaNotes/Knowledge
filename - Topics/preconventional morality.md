- $n$. The most primitive Kohlberg stage of moral development, in which the child interprets moral behavior entirely in terms of personal gain and loss. It is divided into two levels: at Level 1 the child's moral behavior is guided by the avoidance of punishment (I should not tell lies because I might get into trouble), and at Level 2 it is influenced also by the desire for gain (I should not tell lies because then my parents will reward me). Compare CONVENTIONAL MORALITY, POSTCONVENTIONAL MORALITY.
