- Business structure refers to a company's organization in relation to its legal status. A corporation ªs business structure often states who the owner of the company is, how its profits are distributed, and its managerial hierarchy. There are three main types of business structures: a sole proprietorship, a partnership, and a corporation. The structure of a business affects the amount of taxes an individual or organization must pay to the government, the paperwork they must file during tax season, and the personal liability business owners are accountable for.

- The formal structure of a business. At the simplest level is a sole proprietor, a small business run by a single owner. A partnership is a business owned and controlled by two or more persons through a partnership agreement; it is widely used by professional practices, such as accountants and solicitors, including the largest firms. A private limited company is one in which the liability of the owners is restricted to their shareholdings and the shares are not available to a wider public. A public company ( plc ), on the other hand, offers its shares for sale to the public and often has a very diverse ownership. A co-operative is a business in which the ownership and control is held equally by its worker members.
