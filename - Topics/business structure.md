- Business structure refers to a company's organization in relation to its legal status. A corporation ªs business structure often states who the owner of the company is, how its profits are distributed, and its managerial hierarchy. There are three main types of business structures: a sole proprietorship, a partnership, and a corporation. The structure of a business affects the amount of taxes an individual or organization must pay to the government, the paperwork they must file during tax season, and the personal liability business owners are accountable for.
