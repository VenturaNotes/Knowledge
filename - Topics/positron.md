## Source [^1]
- $n$. an electrically charged particle released in some radioactive decays, notably fluorine-18 or nitrogen-13, that has the same mass as an electron but opposite charge. It has a very short lifetime as it quickly reacts with an electron (annihilation) to produce a pair of gamma rays, which are emitted in diametrically opposite directions. The energy of each gamma ray is always 511 keV .
