- Predictive analytics uses data, statistics, algorithms, and machine learning to predict future outcomes based on historical data. Predictive analytics is defined by four factors: a focus on prediction, a quick analysis measured in hours or days, a focus on the accuracy of the predictions, and a focus on how easy the analysis is to understand. In other words, predictive analytics has to quickly and easily predict realistic future outcomes based only on past data.
