- (e-conveyancing) The transfer of land by electronic means instead of by paper documents. A legal framework for such conveyancing was set in place by the Electronic Communications Act 2000 and the Land Registration Act 2002. Although electronic conveyancing is not yet a reality, the land registers are already kept in electronic form and it is possible to discharge mortgages of registered land electronically. See LAND REGISTRATION.
