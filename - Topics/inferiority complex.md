Adler introduced the concept in 1907 in a book translated as Study of Organ Inferiority and its Psychical Compensation (1917). In a later book The Neurotic Constitution (1926, original work 1912), he described it as follows: 'The constitutional inferiority and similarly effective childhood situations give rise to a feeling of inferiority which demands a compensation in the sense of an enhancement of the self-esteem' (p. 111). In an article in 1935 Adler distinguished between natural feelings of inferiority and the inferiority complex proper.
