- Jailbreaking is the process of removing an Apple device’s manufacturer settings, allowing the device user to run code that has not been authorized by the device’s original manufacturer. Jailbreaking allows Apple users to have more control over their device, as it allows them to tweak various aspects of the iOS interface and install applications that are banned from the Apple Store. Jailbroken devices cannot be updated using a new download of iOS, meaning that once an Apple device is jailbroken, it must be updated using the appropriate jailbreaking hack. Jailbreaking can potentially expose an Apple device to security issues and stabilities issues such as potential crashes, freezes, and shortened battery life. Due to this, company employees typically refrain from jailbreaking their company-issued iPhones and iPads. While jailbreaking is the term used for Apple devices, rooting and cracking are terms used to describe the modification of other devices such as Androids.
