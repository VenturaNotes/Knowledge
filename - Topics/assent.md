- $n$. agreement to undergo medical treatment sought from an adult or child who lacks capacity to consent. More generally, permission from patients with capacity, but whose autonomy is constrained, given to their doctor to act in their best interests. Assent has ethical but not legal force. In medical research, particularly with children over seven years, it is difficult to justify proceeding without assent, since research is not principally and inevitably in the patient's best interests.
