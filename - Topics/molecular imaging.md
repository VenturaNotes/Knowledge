- an emerging area of imaging that exploits recent developments of molecular and cell biology to create new markers. Most molecular imaging uses versions of these markers labelled with radioactive isotopes, which - after administration - are localized in the body and can be detected using such techniques as positron emission tomography, SPECT scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, and optical imaging.
