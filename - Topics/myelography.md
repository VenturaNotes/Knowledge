- $n$. a specialized method of X-ray examination to demonstrate the spinal canal that involves injection of a radiopaque contrast medium into the subarachnoid space by lumbar puncture. The X-rays obtained are called myelograms. It is of importance in the recognition of tumors of the spinal cord and other conditions compressing the cord or the nerve roots. The former use of oil-based dyes in myelography was an occasional cause of arachnoiditis. This complication is now avoided by the use of watersoluble contrast media. Myelography is now often combined with simultaneous CT scanning but is becoming increasingly superseded by magnetic resonance imaging.
