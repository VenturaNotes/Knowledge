- The risk associated with early payments of obligations. A prime example is the risk that a borrower will repay a fixed-rate mortgage early at a time when interest rates are falling, leaving the lender with a lower interest income than anticipated. To offset this risk, lenders sometimes impose a prepayment penalty on loans.
