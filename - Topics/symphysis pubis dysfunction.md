- (SPD) pain in the region of the pelvic girdle, most commonly over the pubic bone in the front or in the lower back and usually caused by excessive movement of the symphysis pubis and other pelvic joints. This is common during pregnancy, hence the condition is also called pregnancy-related pelvic girdle pain (PPGP). Treatment is usually with physiotherapy.
