- $n$. A neuron, usually a sensory nerve cell, with two processes (2), an axon and a dendrite, extending in opposite directions from its cell body or soma. It is found abundantly in the middle layer of the retina, where retinal bipolar cells with center-surround receptive fields$\textemdash$the center being supplied by direct inputs from photoreceptors and the surround by horizontal cells, or vice versa$\textemdash$relay information to retinal ganglion cells, but in general it is the least common type of neuron in the nervous system, although it is the one usually depicted in the standard textbook diagram of a supposedly typical neuron. Also called a bipolar neuron. See also off-Center Cell, on-Center Cell.
