- an inherited disorder of the blood that is characterized by episodes of spontaneous bleeding similar to haemophilia. It is due to a variety of abnormalities of the von Willebrand factor, a glycoprotein necessary for platelet activation. This results in a bleeding tendency. The most common type of von Willebrand's disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait; some types are inherited as autosomal recessive traits. \[A. von Willebrand (1870-1949), Swedish physician]
