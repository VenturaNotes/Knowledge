- The bin packing problem with items of different sizes, where the items have an associated value, so as to maximize the total value. This is akin to a hiker packing a knapsack (or rucksack) with a limit on the weight they can carry, but it also models any resource allocation problem with constraints such as finances, time, or manpower. A method of solution is the branch and bound method

## Source[^3]
- A common example of an integer programming problem: a knapsack has volume $V$ and there are an unlimited number of each of $N$ different items. For $i=1, \ldots, N$ one unit of item $i$ has known volume $V_{i}$ and known value $m_{i}$. Integer numbers of the various items may be put into the knapsack and the objective is to pack as much value as possible into the knapsack without exceeding the total volume $V$.
