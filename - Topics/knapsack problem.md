- The bin packing problem with items of different sizes, where the items have an associated value, so as to maximize the total value. This is akin to a hiker packing a knapsack (or rucksack) with a limit on the weight they can carry, but it also models any resource allocation problem with constraints such as finances, time, or manpower. A method of solution is the branch and bound method
