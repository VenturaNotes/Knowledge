- $n$. an operation to enlarge the capacity of and to decrease the pressure within the bladder by incorporating a segment of bowel. In a clam cystoplasty, the bladder is cut across transversely from one side of the neck to the other side through the dome (fundus) of the bladder and a length of the ileum, jejunum, or colon is inserted as a patch. In the operation of ileocaecocystoplasty, the dome is removed by cutting across the bladder transversely or sagittally above the openings of the ureters; it is replaced by an isolated segment of caecum and terminal ileum. In ileocystoplasty the bladder is enlarged by an opened-out portion of small intestine. The bladder may be totally replaced by a reservoir constructed from either small or large intestine (see CYSTECTOMY).
