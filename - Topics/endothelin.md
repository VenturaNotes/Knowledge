## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. any one of a class of peptide hormones, consisting of chains of 21 amino acids, that are synthesized by endothelial cells, often of large blood vessels. They are the most powerful known stimulants of smooth muscle (such as that in the walls of arteries) and are believed to be important causes of hypertension. The drug bosentan, which blocks receptors for endothelin-1, is administered by mouth for the treatment of pulmonary hypertension.
## Source[^2]
- (ET) Any of several related peptides, all comprising 21 amino acids and first identified in cultured endothelial cells. Endothelin 1 (ET-1) is released by the endothelium of blood vessels and is a potent vasopressor, causing constriction of vessels and raising blood pressure. The other endothelins resemble ET-1 structurally but are synthesized in other tissues. The endothelins bind to either of two classes of G-protein-coupled receptors, $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{A}}$ and $\mathrm{ET}_{\mathrm{B}}$, and antagonists of these receptors are used to treat pulmonary arterial hypertension.
