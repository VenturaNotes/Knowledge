## Synthesis
- A single-threaded CPU (or processor core) handles tasks sequentially, executing one instruction stream (thread) at a time. This means it can only do one thing at any instant, though the operating system can switch between tasks rapidly
	- #question What are some examples or algorithms of multi-threading being faster on a single-threaded CPU
		- #question Can I just say one CPU or single-threaded more appropriate?
	- #question What is the difference between CPU or processor core?
	- #question Is there a difference between stream or thread? 
## Source [^1]
- A property of a body of code that activates more than one processor, but does so in such a way that at any one time no more than one processor is active. This results in what is termed [[serial programming]]. For example, code that initiates peripheral transfers may be so written that while a transfer is in progress the processor will not be active, and vice versa. See also MULTITHREADING, THREADING.
