- A property of a body of code that activates more than one processor, but does so in such a way that at any one time no more than one processor is active. This results in what is termed [[serial programming]]. For example, code that initiates peripheral transfers may be so written that while a transfer is in progress the processor will not be active, and vice versa. See also MULTITHREADING, THREADING.
