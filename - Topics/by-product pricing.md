- Setting the price for a by-products in order to make the price of the main product more competitive. For example, in producing processed meats, chemicals, or oil there are often by-products, which-if they had to be disposed of-would make the main product uncompetitive. The producer therefore attempts to sell these by-products at the best possible price in order to keep the main product competitive.
