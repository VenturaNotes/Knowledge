- Employee Self-Service (ESS) is a portal that contains HR information and other important software or documents that employees may need to access. Employees are able to access this system on their own using a secure login and password at any time. Some of the information that an ESS may contain includes payroll, employee benefit information, time-off requests, expense reimbursements, or contact and address information.
