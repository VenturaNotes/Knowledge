- $n$. a collection of dilated veins in the spermatic cord. Approximately $90 \%$, affect the left side rather than the right. It usually produces no symptoms apart from occasional aching discomfort. In some cases varicocele is associated with testicular atrophy or a poor sperm count (see OLIGOSPERMIA) sufficient to cause infertility. Surgical correction or radiological embolization of the varicocele in such patients (varicocelectomy) usually results in a considerable improvement in the quality and motility of the sperm, but may or may not improve the number of pregnancies and live births thereafter. A renal cancer should be excluded in men presenting with a left-sided varicocele.
