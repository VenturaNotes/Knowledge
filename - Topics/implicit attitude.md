- $n$. An attitude activated without conscious awareness by memory of past experiences, as when a woman meets a man and takes an instant dislike to him because he reminds her unconsciously of an uncle whom she disliked when she was a child. It is usually measured by means of the implicit association test. See also MODERN RACISM.
