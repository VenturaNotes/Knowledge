- $n$. A form of hypochondria in medical students, occasionally developing into full-blown somatic symptom disorder, characterized by anxiety about having one or more (often several) of the disorders that are being studied. It often occurs as students begin studying mental disorders, when they begin to believe that they are suffering from the disorders that they are reading about in textbooks, and in this form it is also found among psychology students. Also called medical student hypochondria. MSS abbrev.
