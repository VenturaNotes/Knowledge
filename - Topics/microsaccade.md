- $n$. One of the forms of physiological nystagmus, consisting of a tiny saccade, usually through a visual angle between 1 and 2 minutes of arc (sixtieths of a degree), occurring in random directions three or four times a second while an observer fixates an object visually, necessary to prevent the visual image from disappearing, as an artificially stabilized retinal image does after about a second. See also ocular drift, ocular Tremor. \[From Greek mikros small + French saccade a jerk, from Old French saquer to pull]
