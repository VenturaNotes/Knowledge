- The two laws of a Boolean algebra that provide a method of expressing the complement of a complex expression in terms of the complements of individual components:$$\begin{aligned}& (x \vee y)^{\prime}=x^{\prime} \wedge y^{\prime} \\& (x \wedge y)^{\prime}=x^{\prime} \vee y^{\prime}\end{aligned}$$The pair is self-dual. The term de Morgan's laws is often used to describe instances of these laws as they apply in particular cases, e.g. to sets or to logical expressions. The laws are named for Augustus de Morgan.
