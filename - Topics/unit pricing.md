- The practice of showing the price of a single unit of a product in order that shoppers can compare the price against the cost of a multipack. A single bag of crisps in a supermarket might cost 30 p. A larger bag containing six single bags could be offered at $Â£ 1.50$, i.e. a unit price of 25p each. The shopper can therefore see at a glance that the larger purchase is the more economical.
