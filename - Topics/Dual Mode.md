- Dual-mode mobile devices operate on two different bearer technologies, such as GSM and WCDMA or 1x and WCDMA. This allows users to switch between networks without having to change devices. For example, a user with a dual-mode phone can call on their GSM network in the morning and then use the same device to access the internet on their WCDMA network in the evening. Users can switch between networks, from 2G to 3G, depending on their needs.
