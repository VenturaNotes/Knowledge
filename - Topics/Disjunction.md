## Source[^2]
- A logical expression of the form

  

$$

a_{1} \vee a_{2} \vee \ldots \vee a_{n}

$$

  

where $\vee$ is the $$ OR operation. A particular disjunction of interest is the disjunctive normal form of a Boolean expression involving $n$ variables, $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$. Each $a_{i}$ is then of the form

  

$$

\left(y_{1} \wedge y_{2} \wedge \ldots y_{n}\right)

$$

  

where $\Lambda$ is the $$ AND operation and each $y_{i}$ is equal to $x_{i}$ or the complement of $x_{i}$. Reducing expressions to disjunctive normal form provides a ready method of determining the equivalence of two Boolean expressions. See also PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS. Compare CONJUNCTION.

- $n$. the separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes during meiosis or of the chromatids of a chromosome during anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. Compare NONDISJUNCTION.
