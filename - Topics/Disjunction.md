## Source[^2]
- A logical expression of the form

  

$$

a_{1} \vee a_{2} \vee \ldots \vee a_{n}

$$

  

where $\vee$ is the $$ OR operation. A particular disjunction of interest is the disjunctive normal form of a Boolean expression involving $n$ variables, $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$. Each $a_{i}$ is then of the form

  

$$

\left(y_{1} \wedge y_{2} \wedge \ldots y_{n}\right)

$$

  

where $\Lambda$ is the $$ AND operation and each $y_{i}$ is equal to $x_{i}$ or the complement of $x_{i}$. Reducing expressions to disjunctive normal form provides a ready method of determining the equivalence of two Boolean expressions. See also PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS. Compare CONJUNCTION.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. the separation of pairs of homologous chromosomes during meiosis or of the chromatids of a chromosome during anaphase of mitosis or meiosis. Compare NONDISJUNCTION.
## Source[^4]
- n. 
- (1) The act or process of disconnecting, or the state of being disconnected, especially the separation during meiosis or mitosis of the members of each pair of homologous chromosomes. 
- (2) In logic, two propositions (1) connected by an operator denoting or to form a single compound proposition, usually written $p \vee q$, where $p$ and $q$ represent the component propositions or disjuncts, the compound proposition being true if one or both of its disjuncts are true. Also called an inclusive disjunction to distinguish it from the less common exclusive disjunction, which is true if either of its disjuncts is true but not if both are true. See also disjunctive CONCEPT. Compare CONJunction (2). \[From Latin dis- indicating reversal + iunctio joining + -ion indicating an action, process, or state]
