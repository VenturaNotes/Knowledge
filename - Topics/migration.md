- Movement of people between regions or countries. Immigration and emigration are usually reserved for migration into and out of countries, respectively. Migration may be temporary, with the intention of returning to the country of origin in the future, or permanent; or migrants may not have decided between these alternatives at the time of migration. Migration is affected by push and pull factors. Push factors include lack of employment opportunities, and fears of disorder or of persecution on grounds of race, religion, or politics in the areas people leave. Pull factors include favourable employment opportunities, good health and educational facilities, public order and freedom, and a favourable climate, particularly for retirement, in the areas people move to.

- The seasonal movement of complete populations of animals to a more favorable environment. It is usually a response to lower temperatures resulting in a reduced food supply, and is often triggered by a change in day length (see photoperiodism). Migration is common in mammals (e.g. porpoises and whales), fish (e.g. eels and salmon), and some insects (e.g. butterflies) but is most marked in birds. The Arctic tern, for example, migrates annually from its breeding ground in the Arctic circle to the Antarctic$\textemdash$a distance of some 17,600 km . Migrating animals possess considerable powers of orientation; birds seem to possess a compass sense, using the sun, pole stars (at night), and (in cloud) the earth's magnetic lines of force as reference points (see NAVIGATION).
