- Movement of people between regions or countries. Immigration and emigration are usually reserved for migration into and out of countries, respectively. Migration may be temporary, with the intention of returning to the country of origin in the future, or permanent; or migrants may not have decided between these alternatives at the time of migration. Migration is affected by push and pull factors. Push factors include lack of employment opportunities, and fears of disorder or of persecution on grounds of race, religion, or politics in the areas people leave. Pull factors include favourable employment opportunities, good health and educational facilities, public order and freedom, and a favourable climate, particularly for retirement, in the areas people move to.
