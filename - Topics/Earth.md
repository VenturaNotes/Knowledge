- Our particular planet in the solar system. The Earth is often assumed to be a sphere with a radius of approximately 6400km. A more accurate accepted value is 6371km. A better approximation is to say that the Earth is in the shape of an oblate spheroid with an equatorial radius of 6378km and a polar radius of 6357km. The mass of the Earth is $5.976 \times 10^{24}$kg
