- any attempt at self-injury or self-poisoning, as often occurs in the context of acute stress, personality disorder, depression, and alcoholism. It may or may not involve suicidal intent. Treatment begins with a psychosocial assessment, on the basis of which the patient may be offered various forms of psychotherapy and occasionally antipsychotic medication, lithium, or SSRIs. If the attempt is serious, immediate treatment may be necessary in a medical ward or (more rarely), if suicidal intent persists, in a psychiatric ward. Patients who do not have a mental disorder should be assessed using the criteria set out in the Mental Capacity Act 2005 and, if found to have capacity, are entitled to consent to or refuse treatment like any other capacitous adult. See also SUICIDE.
