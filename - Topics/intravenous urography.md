- (IVU) X-ray imaging of the urinary tract following the injection into a vein of a radiopaque contrast medium. This material is concentrated and excreted by the kidneys, and the IVU reveals the ureters and bladder. An IVU provides information about kidney function and may reveal the presence of stones, tumours, obstructions, or anatomical abnormalities in the urinary tract. See also PYELOGRAPHY.
