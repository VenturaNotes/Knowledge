- Resides in the left cerebral hemisphere for the vast majority of individuals
- Named after the physician [[Paul Broca]] who first identified the region as playing a potentially important role in speech production

- the area of cerebral motor cortex responsible for the initiation and control of speech. It is situated in the left frontal lobe in most (but not all) right-handed people, in the region of Brodmann areas 44 and 45. \[P. P. Broca (1824-80), French surgeon]
## Source[^3]
- A region of the brain located in the frontal lobe of the cerebral hemisphere (see CEREBRUM), just anterior to and below the primary motor cortex, concerned with speech generation. It is named after the French neurosurgeon Paul Broca (1824-80), who found that damage to this area caused speech deficits in his patients. Broca's area is one of several regions that are involved in processing language and producing speech; it sends impulses to the primary motor cortex, which in turn instructs the vocal apparatus to articulate words. It also seems to be crucial for learning the rules of language and giving meaning to speech. Broca's area receives inputs via a large bundle of nerves (the arcuate fasciculus) from Wernicke's area in the temporal lobe, which is concerned more with processing language inputs, whether as speech or written words. These language areas occur most commonly in the left cerebral hemisphere (in $90 \%$ of right-handed and $70 \%$ of left-handed persons).

- $n$. A region of the cerebral cortex towards the back of the inferior (lowest) gyrus of the frontal lobe, immediately anterior to the tip of the temporal lobe, usually in the left cerebral hemisphere in both left-handed and right-handed people, involved in the production of spoken and written language. Lesions in this area are associated with Broca's aphasia, also called expressive aphasia or motor aphasia (see APhasia). Also called Broca's center or Broca's speech center. Compare Wernicke's area. \[Named after the French surgeon and anthropologist Paul Broca (1824-80), who discovered its function in 1861]
