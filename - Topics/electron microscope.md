- a microscope that uses a beam of electrons as a radiation source for viewing the specimen. The resolving power (ability to register fine detail) is a thousand times greater than that of an ordinary light microscope. The specimen must be examined in a vacuum, which necessitates special techniques for preparing it, and the electrons are usually focused onto a fluorescent screen (for direct viewing) or onto a photographic plate (for a photograph, or electron micrograph). A transmission electron microscope is used to examine thin sections at high magnification. A scanning electron microscope reveals the surfaces of objects at various magnifications; its great depth of focus is advantageous.

- A form of microscope that uses a beam of electrons instead of a beam of light (as in the optical microscope) to form a large image of a very small object, such as a cell organelle, a virus, or a DNA molecule. In optical microscopes the resolution is limited by the wavelength of the light. High-energy electrons, however, can be associated with a considerably shorter wavelength than light; for example, electrons accelerated to an energy of $10^{5}$ electronvolts have a wavelength of 0.04 nanometre, enabling a resolution of $0.2\textendash0.5 \mathrm{~nm}$ to be achieved. The transmission electron microscope (see illustration) has an electron beam, sharply focused by electron lenses (coils producing a magnetic field or electrodes between which an electric field is created), passing through a very thin metallized specimen (less than 50 nanometres thick) onto a fluorescent screen, where a visual image is formed. This image can be photographed. High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM), also called phase-contrast TEM, can achieve resolutions below $0.05^{\circ} \mathrm{nm}$, enabling direct imaging of atomic structure. The scanning electron microscope can be used with thicker specimens and forms a perspective image, although the resolution and magnification are lower. It is used particularly for examining surface features of small objects, such as pollen grains. In this type of instrument a beam of primary electrons scans the specimen and those that are reflected, together with any secondary electrons emitted, are collected. This current is used to modulate a separate electron beam in a TV monitor, which scans the screen at the same frequency, consequently building up a picture of the specimen. The resolution is limited to about 10-20 nm. See also FIELD-EMISSION MICROSCOPE; FIELDIONIZATION MICROSCOPE; IMMUNOELECTRON MICROSCOPY.
