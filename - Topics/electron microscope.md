- a microscope that uses a beam of electrons as a radiation source for viewing the specimen. The resolving power (ability to register fine detail) is a thousand times greater than that of an ordinary light microscope. The specimen must be examined in a vacuum, which necessitates special techniques for preparing it, and the electrons are usually focused onto a fluorescent screen (for direct viewing) or onto a photographic plate (for a photograph, or electron micrograph). A transmission electron microscope is used to examine thin sections at high magnification. A scanning electron microscope reveals the surfaces of objects at various magnifications; its great depth of focus is advantageous.
