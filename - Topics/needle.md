- $n$. a slender sharp-pointed instrument used for a variety of purposes. The size and shape of needles used in surgery for stitching tissue depend on the type of surgery. Most surgical needles have suture material fused onto them (so-called atraumatic needles). Hollow needles are used to inject substances into the body (in hypodermic syringes), to obtain specimens of tissue (see PUNCTURE), or to withdraw fluid from a cavity (see ASPIRATION; BIOPSY). See also STOP NEEDLE.
