- a malignant tumor arising from blood vessels in the skin and appearing as purple to dark brown plaques or nodules. It is common in Africa and is sometimes seen in those of Mediterranean extraction, but more commonly occurs in patients with AIDS. The tumour evolves slowly; radiotherapy is the treatment of choice for localized lesions but chemotherapy may be of value in metastatic disease. Highly active antiretroviral therapy (see ANTIRETROVIRAL DRUG) should be started in those with HIV infection as a first-line treatment. \[M. Kaposi (1837-1902), Hungarian dermatologist]
