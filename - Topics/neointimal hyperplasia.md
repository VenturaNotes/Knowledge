- a pathological process involved in atherosclerosis of arteries and vein grafts, and in restenosis, that may be in response to angioplasty and stent placement. Damage to the endothelium of the artery exposes the underlying smooth muscle cells in the media to cytokines, growth factors, and other plasma components in the circulation, which results in loss of their contractile characteristics. These abnormal muscle cells migrate to the intima, where they proliferate and eventually form a thick layer of tissue (neointima), which occludes the artery.
