- The incentive to hold money as a store of value. If prices are stable, money is a poor store of value as it earns little or no return. When inflation occurs, money does even worse as a store of value. If prices fall, however, money is an attractive asset, and if any chance of falling prices is anticipated, this can prompt a desire to hold money as an asset. In the IS-LM model of Keynesian economics consumers can hold savings in money or in bonds. Money is a safe asset whereas bonds are risky. The relative proportions of the two assets in savings will depend on a consumer's degree of risk aversion. A highly risk-averse consumer will hold a large proportion in money.
