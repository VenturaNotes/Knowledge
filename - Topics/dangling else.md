- The ambiguity that arises if a language allows constructs of the form if $b 1$ then if $b 2$ then $S 1$ else $S 2$

in which it is not clear which if is associated with the else. Algol 60 resolved the ambiguity by forbidding the use of if immediately after then; Pascal, C, C++, and Java associate the else with the innermost if. Ada avoids the problem by pairing each if with an explicit end if.
