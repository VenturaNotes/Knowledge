- The total supply of goods and services that firms in an economy plan to sell during a specific time period at varying price levels

## Source[^2]
- The total amount of real goods and services that the enterprises in an economy are willing to provide at any given ratio of prices to wages. This can be increased by greater productivity due to increases in the volume of productive equipment or improvements in technical knowledge or the quality of the labor force. Whether actual output equals aggregate supply depends on two conditions. First, there must be sufficient aggregate demand to match the supply: if there is not, output is demandconstrained. Second, there must be a sufficient supply of labor to satisfy firms' demand for it: if real wages are low, aggregate supply by firms may require more employment than the labor supply forthcoming at these wages, in which case output is constrained by labor shortages. In an economy where firms do not act competitively, the concept of aggregate supply is not applicable: firms in markets characterized by imperfect competition do not have supply curves. See also DEMAND-DETERMINED OUTPUT.

- The total supply of all the goods and services in an economy. J. M. Keynes made aggregate demand the focus of macroeconomics; however, since the 1970s many economists have questioned the importance of aggregate demand in determining the health of an economy, suggesting instead that governments should concentrate on establishing conditions to encourage the supply of goods and services. This could entail deregulation, encouraging competition, and removing restrictive practices in the labor market.
