## Source [^1]
- (chondriosome) n. (pl. mitochondria) a structure, occurring in varying numbers in the cytoplasm of every cell, that is the site of the cell's energy production. Mitochondria contain ATP and the enzymes involved in the cell's metabolic activities, and also their own DNA; mitochondrial genes (which in humans encode 13 proteins) are inherited through the female line. Each mitochondrion is bounded by a double membrane, the inner being folded inwards to form projections (cristae). -mitochondrial adj.
## Source[^2]
- (pl. mitochondria) A structure within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells that carries out aerobic respiration: it is the site of the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain, and therefore the cell's energy production. It also participates in numerous other cellular processes, including calcium buffering, phospholipid biosynthesis, and apoptosis. Mitochondria vary greatly in shape, size, and number but are typically oval or sausage-shaped and bounded by two membranes, the inner one being folded into finger-like projections (cristae); they contain their own DNA (see MITOCHONDRIAL DNA). Components of the electron transport chain and, in plants, the alternative respiratory pathway are located in the inner mitochondrial membrane. They are most numerous in cells with a high level of metabolic activity. Mitochondria are dynamic structures, moving around inside the cell, changing shape, undergoing fission and fusion, and forming a complex network rather than discrete organelles. According to the endosymbiont theory, mitochondria originated as symbiotic aerobic bacteria living inside the predecessors of eukaryotic cells.

- $n$. Any of the tiny (from two to five micrometers long) bean-shaped bodies that are evolutionarily descended from a free-living bacterium and are present in the cytoplasm of every cell, in large numbers in cells with heavy energy demands, releasing through the Krebs cycle most of the energy that cells, tissues, and organs of the body require to function. See also CRISTA, MITOCHONDRIAL DNA, PLASMAGENE. mitochondria pl. mitochondrial adj. \[From Greek mitos a thread + chondros cartilage, as the German biologist Carl Benda (1857-1933) mistakenly thought it was when he named mitochondria in 1898]
