## Synthesis
- (1) ABC is essentially selling a product based on the materials and labor used to make it instead of the volume which is typically used to determine the cost of a product
- (2) ABC differs from traditional costing methods because it includes the cost of materials and labor. This is beneficial for a software development team because servers might cost more to deliver a product such as a video game
- (3) The types of activities that would be considered in ABC would be materials as well as labor
- (4) Perhaps the cost of servers would determine this. 
- (5) I'm not exactly sure about this answer. I don't know many parts of software project management. Perhaps acknowledging the cost of project management software such as ClickUp or Notion would help me pick one with a better cost but I would need to know more steps to better answer this question
- (6) Some challenges for ABC is that it does create overhead when calculating the costs into the product which may cause the product to be too costly
- (7) Since a software engineering team is payed for the work, this might be included into the end cost of the product. 
- (8) Since materials are considered to be calculated into ABC, then the cost of a third-party service could be included into the product
- (9) Outsourcing might not be as important because since ABC includes the cost of labor and materials, there is no reason to get cheaper labor since the cost of the product would be greater regardless. I'm not sure what to say about automation though. 
- (10) ABC can be applied consistently across teams and projects by simply keep listing the expenses. I'm not sure what an expense list is called but maybe you could help with that

- Activity-based costing (ABC) is a method of assigning costs to products or services based on the activities required for their production. This includes things such as materials and labor. The difference between this approach versus traditional accounting methods, where costs are assigned solely by volume produced (i.e., units sold), is that ABC allows companies to more accurately determine the cost of each product or service they have because it considers all factors involved in creating them—not just how many were made but also what went into making them.

- (1) Can you explain what activity-based costing (ABC) is in a few sentences?
	- Activity-Based Costing (ABC) is a method of assigning costs to products or services based on the specific activities involved in their production. Unlike traditional costing, which allocates costs based on a broad measure like volume or units produced, ABC assigns costs based on activities such as labor, material handling, and overhead. This allows for a more accurate cost determination of each product or service.
		- #question What kind of overhead would this suggest?
- (2) How does ABC differ from traditional costing methods, and why might it be more beneficial for a software development team?
	- ABC differs from traditional costing methods by considering both direct and indirect costs associated with producing a product, including materials, labor, and overhead. For a software development team, this could mean tracking the costs of software licenses, cloud services, or time spent on debugging and testing, which might not be accounted for in traditional volume-based costing.
		- #question What kind of formulas would be used for ABC? 
		- #question Is the time spent on debugging and testing considered the overhead here?
- (3) In a software development context, what types of activities would be considered when calculating costs using ABC?
	- In ABC, the types of activities considered include direct costs such as materials and labor, as well as indirect activities like project management, quality assurance, testing, debugging, and even administrative overhead. Each of these activities contributes to the overall cost of producing the software product.
- (4) How could you apply ABC to determine the cost of developing a new feature for an application? What factors would you consider in the calculation?
	- When calculating the cost of developing a new feature, ABC would consider not only hardware costs like servers or cloud infrastructure but also labor costs for developers, testers, and project managers. Additionally, costs for software tools, third-party services, and any required maintenance would also be factored in.
- (5) If you were to implement ABC for software project management, how might it help in identifying inefficiencies or areas where costs could be reduced?
	- Activity-Based Costing helps identify inefficiencies in software project management by providing a detailed breakdown of costs associated with every activity. For instance, you could use ABC to assess the costs of various project management tools, such as ClickUp or Jira, as well as the labor involved in planning, coordinating, and tracking the project. By analyzing this data, you can make more informed decisions about which tools provide the best value for your team’s needs.
		- #question But wouldn't you want the costs to be high so that you could charge more for your product or service?
- (6) What are the potential challenges or limitations of using activity-based costing in a software development environment?
	- One challenge of using ABC is the additional overhead in tracking and assigning costs to each activity. This process can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, potentially leading to increased operational costs. However, the benefit is a more accurate understanding of true costs, which can improve pricing strategies and decision-making in the long run.
		- #question What does "true costs" mean? 
- (7) Could you provide an example of how labor costs might be assigned under ABC in a software engineering team, compared to traditional costing?
	- Labor costs in software engineering include not only the salaries of developers but also the time spent on various activities such as coding, testing, and debugging. Under ABC, these costs would be assigned to the product based on the activities involved. For example, debugging might be a more specialized task with a higher cost than basic coding tasks, so ABC would account for this variance.
		- #question How would ABC be able to account for this variance?
- (8) How would you incorporate external costs, such as third-party services or software libraries, into an activity-based costing model for a software project?
	- In ABC, third-party services like cloud hosting, APIs, or external software libraries are treated as material costs or outsourced activities. These services are essential to the product’s functionality, so their costs should be allocated to the product. For example, if you use AWS for cloud storage, the cost of storage and data transfer would be included in the overall product cost.
- (9). How might activity-based costing influence decisions around outsourcing or automation in software development?
	- Outsourcing can still play a role in reducing costs under ABC if it allows for more efficient labor at a lower cost, even though the method considers all labor costs. Automation can also impact ABC by reducing the need for manual tasks, like testing or code deployment, which lowers labor costs associated with those activities. By automating repetitive tasks, software teams can focus more on high-value activities, ultimately reducing overall costs.
		- #question But wouldn't high-value activities such as debugging potentially increase overall cost?
- (10) In a large software company, how would you ensure that ABC is applied consistently across different teams and projects?
	- ABC can be applied consistently across teams by establishing and maintaining "cost pools" or "cost drivers," which track all the relevant expenses for each activity. These pools are updated regularly to ensure accurate cost assignment across teams and projects. Proper documentation and communication are also critical to ensure all activities are accounted for.
		- #question What are cost pools or cost drivers?

- (ABC; activity costing) A system of costing proposed by Professors Johnson and Kaplan in their book Relevance Lost: The Rise and Fall of Management Accounting (1987), in which they questioned accounting techniques based on absorption costing. Their method recognizes that costs are incurred by each activity that takes place within an organization and that products (or customers) should bear costs according to the activities they use. Cost drivers are identified, together with the appropriate activity cost pools, which are used to charge costs to products. Adherents of activity-based costing maintain that it provides accurate cause-and-effect allocations of costs that cannot be obtained from traditional costing systems.
