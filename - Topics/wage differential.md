- The difference in earnings between workers with similar skills in different industries or between workers with different skills in the same industry. There may also be differentials between urban and non-urban wages or between regions (wages in the UK are highest in the Southeast, where the cost of living is highest). The Equality Act 2010 (as previously the Equal Pay Act 1970) makes it illegal for a differential to exist between the pay of men and women doing like work in the same employment.
## Source[^2]
- A difference in wage rates between two types of workers. Wage differentials may be on account of different levels of skill or different formal qualifications, between unionized and non-unionized firms, or between workers of different age, sex, or ethnic group. In the UK wage differentials based on age are legal, while those based on sex or ethnic group are not.
