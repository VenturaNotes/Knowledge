- $n$. a method for acquiring images during specific parts of a fast-moving cycle. Cardiac gating and respiratory gating are used to avoid the movement artifact produced during the cardiac cycle and respiratory movement, respectively. Therefore the area imaged, for example during the R wave on an electrocardiogram, appears static. The imaging is usually correlated with a physiological measure, such as an ECG trace. Gating is used in CT, MRI, and nuclear medicine.
