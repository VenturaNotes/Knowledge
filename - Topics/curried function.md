- A function of one variable that is related to a function of several variables. Let $f$ be a function of two variables, $x$ and $y$. Then by considering $x$ constant we obtain a function in $y$; this function depends on the value of $x$. We write $$g(x)(y) = f(x,y)$$where $g$ is called a curried version of $f$. Note that $g(x)$ denotes a function rather than a plain value. Currying is often used in theoretical work to deal simply with functions of several variables, e.g. in the lambda calculus
