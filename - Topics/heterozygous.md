- adj. describing an individual in whom the members of a pair of genes determining a particular characteristic are dissimilar. See ALLELE. Compare HOMOZYGOUS. $\textemdash$ heterozygote $n$.
## Source[^2]
- Describing an organism or cell in which the alleles at a given locus on homologous chromosomes are different. An allele that is fully dominant with respect to its recessive counterpart at the same locus will solely determine the nature of the corresponding trait (i.e. the phenotype), whereas alleles displaying incomplete dominance will result in an intermediate phenotype. Heterozygous individuals (i.e. heterozygotes) having greater reproductive fitness compared with either homozygote are said to have heterozygote advantage. Heterozygous organisms do not breed true. Compare HEMIZYGOUS; HOMOZYGOUS.
## Source[^3]
- adj. Having a different allele of a specified gene inherited from each parent at the same chromosomal locus, one normally being a dominant gene and the other recessive. Compare homozygous. heterozygosis or heterozygosity $n$. The condition of having inherited a different allele of a specified gene from each parent; the state or condition of being heterozygous. \[From Greek heteros other + zygon a yoke + -ous having or characterized by]
