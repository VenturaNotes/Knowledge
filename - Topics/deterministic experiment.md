## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A deterministic experiment is an experiment for which the [[Outcome|outcomes]] is unique & certain. The outcomes of this experiment can be predicted before performing the experiment.
- All deterministic experiments can be described by mathematical formulas. 
	- Since the result is certain, [[probability theory]] can not play any role
### Examples

| Experiment                      | Outcome        |
| ------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Cooling water below 0$\degree$C | It will freeze |
|                                 |                |
|                                 |                |
|                                 |                |
|                                 |                |
- Important to note though that cooling water below 0$\degree$C does not always cause it to freeze as [[pressure]] can prevent it from freezing under certain conditions.[^2]
