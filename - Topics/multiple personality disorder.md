## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- a controversial diagnostic entity, in which the affected person is alleged to have two or more distinct, and often contrasting, personalities. As each personality assumes dominance, it determines attitudes and behaviour and usually appears to be unaware of the other personality (or personalities). Transition is sudden and the mental states of the different personalities are normal. The vast majority of psychiatrists deny its existence, and many other explanatory models exist for persons who occasionally show symptoms similar to those described above.
