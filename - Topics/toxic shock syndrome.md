- a state of acute shock due to septicaemia. The commonest cause is a retained foreign body (e.g. a tampon or IUCD) combined with the presence of staphylococci (see also STREPTOCOCCAL TOXIC SHOCK SYNDROME). The condition can be life-threatening if not treated aggressively with appropriate antibiotics and supportive care (including fluid and electrolyte replacement).
