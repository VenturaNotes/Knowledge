- The age at which an individual is expected to retire. Until 2010 this was normally 65 for a man and 60 for a woman in the UK; this is now gradually adjusting to 65 for both in 2018 and 67 for both in 2028. It is at these ages that state pensions begin. However, other policies can nominate other pre-agreed dates, which HM Revenue will accept in certain cases.
