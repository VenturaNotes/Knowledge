- Business intelligence (BI) uses business data from multiple sources to provide insights to support business strategy. Self-service business intelligence (SSBI) empowers business users with less in-depth technical experience to perform data analysis. This is possible via low-code or no-code BI tools. These are often cloud-based, with differing levels of security. This allows data managers to control who can access the data. SSBI often promotes transparency and sharing of data along with insights.
