- A person who has passed the accountancy examinations of one of the recognized accountancy bodies and completed the required work experience. The bodies differ from each other in the way they train their students and the type of work expected to be undertaken. For example, accountants who are members of the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy generally work in local authorities, the National Health Service, or other similar public bodies, while members of the Chartered Institute of Management Accountants work in industry (see MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING). Wherever accountants work, their responsibilities centre on the collating, recording, and communicating of financial information and the preparation of analyses for decision-making purposes. See also CHARTERED ACCOUNTANT; CHARTERED CERTIFIED ACCOUNTANT.
