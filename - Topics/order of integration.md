- The minimum number of times it is necessary to difference a non-stationary time series to produce a stationary series. A series which has to be differenced $n$ times is integrated of order $n$, written $I(n)$. The order of integration can be a fraction, in which case the process is said to be fractionally integrated; fractional differencing is a mathematically convenient representation of an infinite series of lags with a specific pattern in lag coefficients. See also COVARIANCE STATIONARY PROCESS.
