- $n$. A collection of scripts (3) relating to a particular class of situations, such as shopping or going to the cinema, enabling a person to exhibit appropriate behavior without having to think about it. Each memory organization packet is assembled from existing scripts, and different packets often have scripts in common: shopping and going to the cinema, for example, both include a script for paying for goods and services. The inclusion of an inappropriate script in a packet can cause interaction problems, as when a husband treats his wife like a waiter in a restaurant. MOP abbrev.
