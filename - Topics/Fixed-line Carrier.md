- A fixed-line carrier is a telecommunications company that provides landline telephone and broadband internet services to customers. In most cases, these companies also offer TV services, but a few only offer phone and internet. Fixed-line carriers usually have their own network infrastructure, which allows them to offer better quality service than a mobile carrier or an ISP (internet service provider).
