- $n$. (pl. testes) either of the pair of male sex organs that produce spermatozoa and secrete the male sex hormone androgen under the control of gonadotrophins from the pituitary gland. The testes of the fetus form within the abdomen but descend into the scrotum in order to maintain a lower temperature that favours the production and storage of spermatozoa. The bulk of the testis is made up of long convoluted seminiferous tubules (see illustration), in which the spermatozoa develop (see SPERMATOGENESIS). The tubules also contain Sertoli cells, which may nourish developing sperm cells. Spermatozoa pass from the testis to the epididymis to complete their development. The interstitial (Leydig) cells, between the tubules, are the major producers of androgens.

## Source[^2]
- (testicle) (pl. testes) The reproductive organ in male animals in which spermatozoa are produced. In vertebrates there are two testes; as well as sperm, they produce steroid hormones (see ANDROGEN). In most animals the testes are within the body cavity but in mammals, although they develop within the body near the kidneys, they come to hang outside the body cavity in a scrotum. Most of the vertebrate testis is made up of a mass of seminiferous tubules, lined with Sertoli cells, in which the sperms develop (see SPERMATOGENESIS). It is connected to the outside by means of the vas deferens. See REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM.
