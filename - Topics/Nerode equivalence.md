- An equivalence relation, $=_{\mathrm{N}}$, arising in formal language theory. It is defined analogously to the Myhill equivalence by the weaker properties: $$\begin{align}&\text{for a language } L \text{ over } \Sigma,\\&u=_\mathrm{N}u^{\prime}\\&\text{if, for all } w \text{ in } \Sigma^*, \\&uw \in L \text{ iff }u^{\prime}w \in L \\&\text{and for a function }f, \\&u=_\mathrm{N}u^{\prime} \\&\text{if, for all } w \text{ in }\Sigma^*, \\&f(uw) = f(u^{\prime}w) \end{align}$$Although coarser than the Myhill equivalence, it is finite only if the latter is. Unlike the latter, it gives only a right congruence:$$u =_{\mathrm{N}} u^{\prime} \text { implies } u v =_{\mathrm{N}} u^{\prime} v$$and thus does not give rise to a semigroup. The number of equivalence classes is the number of states in the minimal machine for $L$.
