- an organic disorder affecting the brain that results in a memory defect in which new information fails to be learnt although events from the past are still recalled; disorientation in time and place; and a tendency to unintentionally invent material to fill memory blanks (see CONFABULATION). The commonest cause of the condition is untreated Wernicke's encephalopathy in the context of alcoholism. Large doses of thiamine are given as treatment. The condition often becomes chronic. \[S. S. Korsakoff (1854-1900), Russian neurologist]
