- $n$. one of a group of about 30 RNA-containing viruses, originally isolated from the human intestinal tract, that were found to produce pathological changes in cells grown in culture, although they were not clearly associated with any specific disease. These viruses - which were accordingly termed enteric cytopathic human orphan viruses - are now more commonly known as Coxsackie viruses. Compare REOVIRUS.
