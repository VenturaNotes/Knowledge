- An image consisting of data (specifically a set of elements) defined on an $n$-dimensional regular grid that has the potential for display. These elements are referred to as pixels. The pixels in different images may represent a variety of types of information, such as temperature, pressure, velocity, terrain height, or tissue density. The regular grid is frequently over a two-dimensional space but can be three-dimensional, and even fourdimensional if sampling over time is also included. See also IMAGE PROCESSING.

- an image made up of pixels. Each pixel has numbers (digits) to describe its position and shade on the grey scale. The more shades available, described by the number of computer bits required to store the shade of grey, the more accurately the image represents the original tissue contrast. An 8-bit computer image shows $2^{8}$ (256) possible shades of grey, close to the maximum the human eye can differentiate. 12-bit (4096 levels of grey) images are of much higher quality and take up more memory. They can be manipulated more easily by computer using image enhancement techniques. Compare ANALOGUE IMAGE.
