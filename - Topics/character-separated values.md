## Source [^1]
- A file format in which tabular data is encoded as plain text, the fields of the table being separated by commas (or any predefined separator character). Rows in the table correspond to lines in the file, and embedded tables are delimited by double quotes (“ ”). CSV was useful for passing data between distinct applications treating tabular information, such as databases, but has become essentially a legacy format since the advent of XML.
