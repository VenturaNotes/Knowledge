- (Rh factor) a group of antigens that may or may not be present on the surface of the red blood cells; it forms the basis of the rhesus blood group system. Most people have the rhesus factor, i.e. they are Rhpositive. People who lack the factor are termed Rh-negative. Incompatibility between Rh-positive and Rh-negative blood is an important cause of blood transfusion reactions and haemolytic disease of the newborn. See also BLOOD GROUP.

- (Rh factor) An antigen whose presence or absence on the surface of red blood cells forms the basis of the rhesus blood group system. (The factor was first recognized in rhesus monkeys.) Most people possess the Rh factor, i.e. they are rhesus positive ( $\mathrm{Rh}+$ ). People who lack the factor are $\mathrm{Rh}-$. If $\mathrm{Rh}+$ blood is given to an $\mathrm{Rh}-$ patient, the latter develops anti-Rh antibodies. Subsequent transfusion of $\mathrm{Rh}+$ blood results in agglutination, with serious consequences. Similarly, an Rh- pregnant woman carrying an $\mathrm{Rh}+$ fetus may develop anti-Rh antibodies in her blood; these will react with the blood of a subsequent $\mathrm{Rh}+$ fetus, causing anaemia in the newborn baby.
