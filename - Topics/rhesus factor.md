- (Rh factor) a group of antigens that may or may not be present on the surface of the red blood cells; it forms the basis of the rhesus blood group system. Most people have the rhesus factor, i.e. they are Rhpositive. People who lack the factor are termed Rh-negative. Incompatibility between Rh-positive and Rh-negative blood is an important cause of blood transfusion reactions and haemolytic disease of the newborn. See also BLOOD GROUP.
