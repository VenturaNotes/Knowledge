- Round-trip time (RTT) or round-trip delay (RTD) is the number of milliseconds it takes for a network request to reach a destination, such as a server, and return to its starting point. Network administrators use this calculation to determine network latency and connection speeds. Various factors can influence RTT, such as:
	- The distance the signal has to travel to reach its destination and return to its starting point
	- The amount of traffic on the network
	- The time it takes for the server to respond to the network request
