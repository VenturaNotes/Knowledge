- (gonadal dysgenesis) a genetic defect in women in which there is only one X chromosome instead of the usual two. Affected women are infertile: they have female external genitalia but their ovaries fail to develop normally, resulting in absence of menstrual periods (see AMENORRHOEA). Characteristically they are short and have variable developmental defects, which may include webbing of the neck. \[H. H. Turner (1892-1970), US endocrinologist]
## Source[^2]
- A genetic disorder of women caused by the absence of the second sex chromosome (such women are XO, rather than the normal XX). It is characterized by a lack of ovaries and menstrual cycle. Affected women are sterile and lack secondary sexual characteristics, although the external genitalia are present. The syndrome is named after the US endocrinologist H. H. Turner (1892-1970), who first described it.
