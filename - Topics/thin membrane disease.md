- an inherited disease of the kidneys in which the glomerular basement membrane, which filters waste material from the blood, is too thin, allowing small amounts of blood to pass across it. This can be a cause of benign familial haematuria and thin membrane disease is a common finding in renal biopsy series where the procedure has been carried out as part of the investigation of haematuria. Thin membranes are also found in other conditions, e.g. in some cases of Alport's syndrome and Berger's nephropathy.
