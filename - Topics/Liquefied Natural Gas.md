## Source [^1]
- Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbons that forms a liquid when chilled to a temperature of -260° F (–162° C), making it easier to transport under low pressure. During the liquefaction process, gases, water and other contaminants are removed that would freeze during treatment. The resulting LNG is odorless, colorless, non-toxic and non-corrosive, but it’s flammable in its gaseous state. LNG technologies involve operational processes related to shipping, logistics and contract/trading with a focus on supply chain management and transit risk management.
