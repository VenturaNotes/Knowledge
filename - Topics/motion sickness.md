- (travel sickness) nausea, vomiting, and headache caused by motion during travel by sea, road, or air. The symptoms are due to overstimulation of the balance organs in the inner ear by repeated small changes in the position of the body and are aggravated by movements of the horizon. Sedative antihistamine drugs (see ANTIEMETIC) are effective in preventing motion sickness.
