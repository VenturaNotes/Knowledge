- (P2P lending; social lending) The growing practice in which those with spare funds lend money to small businesses or private borrowers via a dedicated website, thus avoiding the intermediation of a bank. This usually brings a higher return but carries a higher risk of default. Peer-to-peer lending sites were formerly unregulated but came under the remit of the new Financial Conduct Authority in April 2014. See also CROWDFUNDING.
