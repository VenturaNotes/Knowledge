- The artifact by which fast-moving objects appear blurred. Each frame in a conventional film is an average sample taken over about half the time it takes to record the frame. In consequence, fast-moving images appear blurred. Temporal aliasing is more severe in the case of computer-generated images where the image is likely to be defined at a specific point in time. In computer animation, the created images are often deliberately blurred to achieve a similar effect to the conventional camera and enhance the simulation of motion
