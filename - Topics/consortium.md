- A combination of two or more businesses formed on a temporary basis, often to quote for and carry out a single large project. The purpose of forming a consortium may be to eliminate competition between the members or to pool skills, not all of which may be available to the individual companies. Consortia often involve the setting up of a special purpose vehicle or a joint venture. See also CONSORTIUM RELIEF.
