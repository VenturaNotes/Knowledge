- A bitcoin address is a unique identifier that represents a virtual location that cryptocurrencies can be used to send or receive bitcoin. When businesses create a bitcoin wallet, they receive both a public and private key. The private key proves a business owns a specific bitcoin wallet and the public key is used to send and receive funds. A bitcoin address is a hashed version of a public key, and is usually converted into a QR code that can be easily scanned during a transaction. Bitcoin addresses typically consist of a string of 26 to 35 alphanumeric characters or a QR code. Bitcoin addresses act as a token for a single transaction and cannot hold a bitcoin account balance. For each new transaction, a business must generate a new single-use bitcoin address to provide to the customer to facilitate the transaction.
