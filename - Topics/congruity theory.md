- $n$. A cognitive consistency theory of attitude change, based on balance theory but formulated as a quantitative model, according to which if a source $S$ and attitude object $O$ are linked by an associative assertion (such as $S$ is an $O, S$ likes $O, S$ shakes hands with $O$, or $S$ goes with $O$) or a dissociative assertion (such as $S$ is not an $O, S$ dislikes $O, S$ avoids $O$, or $S$ criticizes $O$ ), then the attitudes to both $S$ and $O$ of the person receiving this message will shift towards a point of equilibrium, the less polarized of the two elements moving proportionately more than the more polarized one. Attitudes towards $S$ and $O$ are measured on a seven-point semantic differential scale from -3 to +3 , and the change equation for the source is Change $(S)=[|O| /(|O|+|S|)] P$, where $|O|$ and $|S|$ are the absolute values (ignoring any negative signs) of the two initial attitudes and $P$ is the pressure towards change-the total amount of change required to produce congruity. Similarly, the change equation for the attitude object is Change $(O)=[|S| /(|S|+|O|)] P$. For example, if a person has a positive attitude towards the composer Tchaikovsky $(+2)$ and a very negative attitude towards homosexuality (-3), and if the person discovers that Tchaikovsky was gay, then the distance between the two and hence the value of $P$ is 5 , and Change $(S)=[3 /(3+2)] 5=3$, which means that the attitude towards Tchaikovsky moves three units in the direction of the attitude towards homosexuality; and by a similar calculation, the attitude towards homosexuality moves two units in the direction of the attitude towards Tchaikovsky; so that the person's attitudes to Tchaikovsky and homosexuality both end up at -1 . For a dissociative assertion, the two move away from each other. In the light of empirical findings two correction factors were added to the theory: an assertion constant to account for the fact that the attitude towards the attitude object tends to change more than the attitude towards the source, and a correction for incredulity that reduces the amount of change in both $S$ and $O$ in proportion to their distance apart (for an associative assertion) or their closeness (for a dissociative assertion). The theory was formulated in 1955 by the US psychologist Charles E(gerton) Osgood (1916-91) and the Canadian-born US psychologist Percy (Hyman) Tannenbaum (1927-2009).
