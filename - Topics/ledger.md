- A collection of accounts of a similar type. Traditionally, a ledger was a large book with separate pages for each account; in modern systems they will usually consist of computer records. The most common ledgers are the nominal ledger containing the impersonal accounts, the sales ledger containing the accounts of an organization's customers, and the purchase ledger containing the accounts of an organization's suppliers.
