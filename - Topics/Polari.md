- $n$. An argot or cant that became popular in gay (1) subculture in English-speaking countries during the 1960s and declined thereafter, though it survives in English slang words such as naff (tasteless), bevvy (a drink), cottaging (frequenting public toilets for sex with strangers) and, less well known, vada (see), believed to have originated in the lingua franca of Mediterranean sailors. Also called Parlyaree. \[From Italian parlare to speak, from Latin parlare to speak]
