- (QSAR) A statistical algorithm that quantitatively defines the relationship between the chemical structure of a drug and its effect on an organism. QSAR studies are often used to predict the activity or toxicity of new drugs. Similar methods can be used to predict the metabolism of new drugs (quantitative structure-metabolism relationships; QSMR).
