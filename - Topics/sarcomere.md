## Synthesis
- The term sarcomere refers specifically to the structural unit of striated muscle fibers
- A sarcomere is the fundamental contractile unit of striated muscle, composed of [[actin]] (thin) and [[myosin]] (thick) filaments. It extends from one Z disc to another and is responsible for muscle contraction through the sliding filament mechanism
## Source[^1]
- $n$. one of the basic contractile units of which striated muscle fibres are composed.
## Source[^2]
- Any of the functional units that make up the myofibrils of a skeletal muscle fibre. Each sarcomere is bounded by two membranes (Z lines), which provide the points of attachment of actin filaments; another membrane (the $\mathbf{M}$ band or line) is the point of attachment of the myosin filaments. The sarcomere is divided into various bands reflecting the arrangement of the filaments (see illustration). During muscle contraction the actin and myosin filaments slide over each other (see Sliding Filament theory) and the length of the sarcomere shortens: the Z lines are drawn closer together and the I and H bands become narrower.
