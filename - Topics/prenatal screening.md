- screening tests carried out to estimate the risk of chromosomal or other abnormalities being present in a developing fetus. They include blood tests to measure levels of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), PAPP-A, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), inhibin (see ACTIVIN), and unconjugated oestriol ($\mathrm{uE}_{3}$) (see also TRIPLE TEST) and also ultrasound scanning for the presence of soft markers (see ULTRASOUND MARKER; NUCHAL TRANSLUCENCY SCANNING). If the results indicate a high risk of abnormalities being present, a diagnosis may be confirmed by more invasive procedures (see PRENATAL DIAGNOSIS).
