- Having the same variance. A set, or a vector, of observations is homoscedastic if the variance of the random error is the same for all observations. This is one of the classical linear regression assumptions underlying the Gauss-Markov theorem. Violation of this assumption is called heteroscedasticity.

- $n$. In statistics, the degree of similarity in the variances of two or more variables. Many distribution-dependent statistical tests, such as analysis of variance and the $t$ test, assume homoscedasticity. Compare heteroscedasticity. homoscedastic adj. \[From Greek homos same + skedasis a scattering or dispersion]
