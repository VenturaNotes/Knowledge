- A tool for numerical data analysis where the dependence of the variable of interest on the explanatory variable is estimated without assuming any specific functional form and is entirely driven by the data. The predicted value of the dependent variable at a given point is estimated by smoothing its values over some neighbourhood of this point. This method allows for more flexibility in comparison with a linear regression or a nonlinear regression, but requires large amount of data and intensive computations. See also KERNEL REGRESSION.
