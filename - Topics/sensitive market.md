- A market in commodities, securities, etc., that is sensitive to outside influences because it is basically unstable. For example, a poor crop in a commodity market may make it sensitive, with buyers anxious to cover their requirements but unwilling to show their hand and risk forcing prices up. News of a hurricane in the growing area, say, could cause a sharp price rise in such a sensitive market.
