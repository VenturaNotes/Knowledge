- (nappy rash) a red skin rash within the napkin area, usually caused by chemical irritation (ammoniacal dermatitis) or infection with Candida. Ammoniacal dermatitis is caused by skin contact with wet soiled nappies, the stool bacteria reacting with urine to form irritant ammonia. Treatment involves exposure to air, application of barrier creams, and frequent nappy changes. Candidal nappy rash is treated with antifungal creams. Other causes of napkin rash include eczema and psoriasis.
