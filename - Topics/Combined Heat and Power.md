- Combined heat and power (CHP), sometimes called "cogeneration," is the simultaneous production of two forms of energy from a single fuel source. This includes both electricity and heat or hot water. Combined heat and power systems are typically used in industrial settings to conserve energy by converting waste heat into usable thermal output for other purposes such as heating buildings or powering equipment.
