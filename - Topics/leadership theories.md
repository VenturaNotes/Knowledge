- In industrial and organizational psychology, various theories that have been put forward to explain the successful or unsuccessful performance of leaders. Such theories tend to fall into three main categories:
	- Trait theories of leadership focus on the role played by certain key personality traits in the leader. These usually include decisiveness, organizational ability, confidence, and communication skills.
	- Behavioral theories of leadership focus on issues of leadership style, notably the extent to which the leader can be described as task-motivated or relationship-motivated. Contingency theories of leadership attempt to define the different leadership behaviors demanded by different situations.
	- Cognitive theories of leadership focus on the ways in which followers' ideas and perceptions can affect the performance of their leaders.
