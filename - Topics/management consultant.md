- A professional adviser who specializes in giving advice to organizations on ways for improving their efficiency and hence their profitability. They come into an organization as total outsiders, uninfluenced by either internal politics or personal relationships, and analyse the way the business is run. At the end of a period, during which two or more members of the consultant firm have spent a considerable time in the organization, they provide a detailed report, giving their suggestions for improving efficiency. Their advice usually spans board-level policy-making and planning, the use of available resources (department by department), the best use of manpower, and a critical assessment of industrial relations, production, marketing, and sales.
