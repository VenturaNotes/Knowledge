- $n$. a variety of white blood cell (leucocyte), present also in the lymph nodes, spleen, thymus gland, gut wall, and bone marrow. With Romanowsky stains, lymphocytes can be seen to have dense nuclei with clear pale-blue cytoplasm. Lymphocytes with scanty cytoplasm are small lymphocytes; those with abundant cytoplasm are large lymphocytes. There are normally $1.5-4.0 \times 10^{9}$ lymphocytes per litre of blood. They are involved in immunity and can be subdivided into B lymphocytes (or B cells), which produce circulating antibodies, and T lymphocytes (or T cells), which are primarily responsible for cell-mediated immunity. T lymphocytes can differentiate into helper T cells or cytotoxic T cells. There is an increase in the number of lymphocytes in the blood and bone marrow in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. $\textemdash$lymphocytic adj.
## Source[^2]
- A type of white blood cell (leucocyte) that has a large nucleus and little cytoplasm. Lymphocytes are formed in the lymph nodes and provide about a quarter of all leucocytes. They are important in the body's defence and are responsible for immune reactions as the presence of antigens stimulates them to produce antibodies. There are two principal populations of lymphocytes: B lymphocytes (see в сеLl), which produce circulating antibodies and are responsible for humoral immunity; and T lymphocytes (see T CELL), which are responsible for cell-mediated immunity.
