- $n$. a variety of white blood cell (leucocyte), present also in the lymph nodes, spleen, thymus gland, gut wall, and bone marrow. With Romanowsky stains, lymphocytes can be seen to have dense nuclei with clear pale-blue cytoplasm. Lymphocytes with scanty cytoplasm are small lymphocytes; those with abundant cytoplasm are large lymphocytes. There are normally $1.5-4.0 \times 10^{9}$ lymphocytes per litre of blood. They are involved in immunity and can be subdivided into B lymphocytes (or B cells), which produce circulating antibodies, and T lymphocytes (or T cells), which are primarily responsible for cell-mediated immunity. T lymphocytes can differentiate into helper T cells or cytotoxic T cells. There is an increase in the number of lymphocytes in the blood and bone marrow in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. $\textemdash$lymphocytic adj.
