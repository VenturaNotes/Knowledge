- A swap in which specified amounts of one currency are exchanged for another currency at agreed principles over time. In an ordinary currency swap both currencies bear interest at a fixed rate: if both currencies bear interest at a floating rate the transaction is known as a basis swap and if one rate is floating and the other fixed it is a cross-currency interest-rate swap.
