- (GC-IR) A form of Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) used to identify small amounts of gas obtained by gas chromatography. Since functional groups in molecules are characteristic in infrared spectra this produces information to supplement that obtained by mass spectrometry. It is easier to perform FT-IR for gas chromatography than for liquid chromatography because carrier solvents in liquid chromatography absorb infrared radiation.
