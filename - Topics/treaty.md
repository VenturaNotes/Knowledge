- (1) Any formal agreement in writing between nations. A commercial treaty relates to trade between the signatories. 
- (2) A transaction in which a sale is negotiated between the parties involved (by private treaty) rather than by auction. 
- (3) An agreement, usually in reinsurance, in which a reinsurer agrees automatically to accept risks from an insurer, either when a certain sum insured is exceeded or on the basis of a percentage of every risk accepted. With such a treaty an insurer has the confidence and capacity to accept larger risks than would otherwise be possible, as the necessary reinsurance is already arranged.
