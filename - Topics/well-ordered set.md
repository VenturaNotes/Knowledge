- A set $S$ on which the relation < is defined, satisfying the following properties:

(a) given $x, y, z$ in $S$,

  

$$

\text { if } x<y \text { and } y<z \text {, then } x<z

$$

  

(b) given $x, y$ in $S$, then exactly one of the following three possibilities is true:

  

$$

x<y, x=y, \text { or } y<x

$$

  

(c) if $T$ is any nonempty subset of $S$, then there exists an element $x$ in $T$ such that

  

$$

\begin{aligned}

& x=y \text { or } x<y \\

& \text { i.e. } x \leq y \text { for all } y \text { in } T

\end{aligned}

$$

  

This relation < is said to be a well ordering of the set $S$.
