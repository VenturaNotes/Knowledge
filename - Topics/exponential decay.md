- If $y=Ae^{kt}$, where $A > 0$ and $k < 0$ are constants, and $t$ denotes time, $y$ is said to be exhibiting exponential decay. Then the length of time it takes for $y$ to be reduced to half its value is the same, whatever the value. This length of time, which equals $-ln2/k$, is called the half-life and is a useful measure of the rate of decay. It is applicable, for example, to the decay of radioactive isotopes.
