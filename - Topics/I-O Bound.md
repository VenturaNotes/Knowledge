- I/O bound is used to describe a situation where the input/output of a system is limiting its performance. There are many ways in which you can increase your I/O bound, such as using a faster drive or increasing the number of drives in your system. Another option is to install more memory on your computer to have enough RAM to handle all its operations without using up too much CPU power.
