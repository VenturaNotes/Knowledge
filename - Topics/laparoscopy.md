- (peritoneoscopy) n. examination of the abdominal structures (which are contained within the peritoneum) by means of a laparoscope. This is passed through a small incision in the wall of the abdomen after insufflating carbon dioxide into the abdominal cavity (creating a pneumoperitoneum). Laparoscopy enables visual assessment of abdominal organs, harvesting of biopsies, and cancer staging. Therapeutic uses include aspiration of cysts, division of adhesions, and surgery that would previously have required laparotomy. Examples include hysterectomy, cholecystectomy, fundoplication, prostatectomy, colectomy, nephrectomy, oophorectomy, Fallopian tube ligation, and ova collection for in vitro fertilization. See also MINIMALLY INVASIVE SURGERY. $\textemdash$laparoscopic adj.
