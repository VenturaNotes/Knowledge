- an acronym for the potential doubling time, the time taken for a tumor to double its cells in the absence of cell loss (i.e. by radiation). It is related to the rate constant for cell production $(k \mathrm{P})$, where $k \mathrm{P}=\log 2 /$ Tpot, and enables direct measurement of the rate of cell proliferation by tumors.
