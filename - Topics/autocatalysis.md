- Catalysis in which one of the products of the reaction is a catalyst for the reaction. Reactions in which autocatalysis occurs have a characteristic S-shaped curve for reaction rate against time – the reaction starts slowly and increases as the amount of catalyst builds up, falling off again as the products are used up.
