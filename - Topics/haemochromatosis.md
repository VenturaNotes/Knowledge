- (hereditary haemochromatosis, bronze diabetes, iron-storage disease) $n$. a hereditary disorder in which there is excessive absorption and storage of iron. This leads to damage and functional impairment of many organs, including the liver, pancreas, and endocrine glands. The main features are a bronze color of the skin, diabetes, and liver failure. It is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait in people of northern European descent and is due to mutations in the haemochromatosis gene (HFE) in the majority of cases. Iron may be removed from the body by blood letting or an iron chelating agent may be administered. Compare HAEMOSIDEROSIS.
