- An invitation from an insurer to continue an insurance policy that is about to expire by paying the renewal premium. The renewal premium is shown on the notice; it may differ from the previous premium, either because insurance rates have changed or because the insured value has changed. Many insurers increase the insured value of certain objects automatically, in line with inflation.
