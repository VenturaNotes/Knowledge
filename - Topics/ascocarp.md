- The reproductive body of fungi of the phylum Ascomycota, which contains ascus cells. An ascocarp may be a closed sphere (cleistothecium), a flask-shaped structure (perithecium) with a small opening (ostiole), or an open cup-shaped structure (apothecium). The ascocarp consists of both ascus-bearing and vegetative hyphae.
