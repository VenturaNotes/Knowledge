- Weak interactions between nonpolar molecules or regions of molecules produced by transient changes in positive and negative charges arising from random variations in electron distribution. They influence how certain biologically important molecules behave when in close proximity (e.g. an enzyme and substrate) and help determine the three-dimensional structure of large biomolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids. They are named after the Dutch physicist Johannes van der Waals (1837-1923).
