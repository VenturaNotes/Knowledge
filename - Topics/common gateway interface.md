## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A protocol for exchanging data between a web server and an application. For example, if a user fills in a form on a web page and submits it to the server, the server passes the data to an application program, which analyses it. The program may also create a reply to the user, which initially goes to the server. The CGI is a standard way of passing this information from server to program and back again. It is part of HTTP. CGI programs are often written in Perl.
## Source[^2]
- The Common Gateway Interface enables a web server to send or receive data from an application such as a database. A CGI script passes a request from the web server to the application. The script receives data from the application and returns that data to a web client, which is typically a web browser.
