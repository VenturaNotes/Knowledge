- $n$. a nutritional disorder due to deficiency of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ (thiamine). It is widespread in rice-eating communities in which the diet is based on polished rice, from which the seed coat (which is rich in thiamine) has been removed. Beriberi takes two forms: wet beriberi, in which there is an accumulation of tissue fluid (oedema), and dry beriberi, in which there is extreme emaciation. There is nervous degeneration in both forms of the disease and death from heart failure is often the outcome.

- A disease caused by a low intake of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ (thiamine; see vitamin B COMPLEX), resulting in damage to peripheral nerves and heart failure. Beriberi was once common in regions of the Far East where the diet was based on polished white rice, which lacks the thiamine-rich seed coat, but its prevalence has decreased in recent years with the adoption of more varied diets.
