## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A logic circuit whose outputs at a specified time are a function only of the inputs at that time. In practice, any physically realizable combinational circuit will have a finite transit time, or delay, between the inputs changing and the outputs changing; the intention of the term combinational is to include algebraic elements (AND gates, OR gates, etc.) and preclude memory elements (flip-flops, etc.). Analysis and synthesis of combinational circuits is facilitated by Boolean algebra and Karnaugh maps. Compare SEQUENTIAL CIRCUIT
