- Traditionally, the company that actually manufactured a product as opposed to a client company responsible for marketing it, usually under the marketer’s name. In some cases, however, the client may add value to the original product (VARs) or incorporate it within its own end product; here, the client could be seen as a ‘second manufacturer’ and also considered as an OEM. The term can therefore be the source of some confusion.
