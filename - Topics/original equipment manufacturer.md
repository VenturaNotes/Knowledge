- Traditionally, the company that actually manufactured a product as opposed to a client company responsible for marketing it, usually under the marketer’s name. In some cases, however, the client may add value to the original product (VARs) or incorporate it within its own end product; here, the client could be seen as a ‘second manufacturer’ and also considered as an OEM. The term can therefore be the source of some confusion.

- An original equipment manufacturer, or OEM, is a company that manufactures products for other companies to resell under their own brands. For example, Dell Inc. is an OEM because it makes computers for other companies such as HP and Apple to sell under their brands. OEMs are often referred to as "white label" because their products are usually sold without any branding from the OEM itself.
