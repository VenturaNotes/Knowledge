- A form of chartering a ship in which the expenses incurred during the period of the charter are paid by the hirer, including the hiring of the master and crew, the provision of fuel and stores, etc. All the hirer gets is the ship. A bareboat charter often ends with the hirer acquiring title in the vessel; in such cases it is known as a demise charter.
