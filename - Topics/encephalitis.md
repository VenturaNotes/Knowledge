- $n$. inflammation of the brain. It may be caused by a viral or bacterial infection or it may be due to an abnormal autoimmune process, such as an allergic response to a systemic viral illness or vaccination (see ENCEPHALOMYELITIS), a remote response to malignancy (paraneoplastic encephalitis), or a primary antibody-mediated autoimmune disorder. Recently a number of antibody-mediated encephalitides have been described (voltage-gated potassium receptor and NMDA-receptor antibody being the commonest) that have characteristic clinical features and are often responsive to immunosuppressive therapies. Viral encephalitis is endemic in some parts of the world; it may also occur epidemically or sporadically. One form - encephalitis lethargica - reached epidemic proportions shortly after World War I and was marked by headache and drowsiness, progressing to coma (hence its popular name - sleepy sickness). Encephalitis can cause postencephalitic parkinsonism. Another type of encephalitis that occurs sporadically is due to the herpes simplex virus.
