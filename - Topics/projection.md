- A mapping from one coordinate space to another, possibly of a lower dimension. It takes the points of an object onto the points of a fixed plane (the view plane) in such a way that each pair of points is collinear with a fixed point, the centre of projection or eyepoint, which lies neither on the object nor the view plane. The main types of projection are parallel and perspective projections.
