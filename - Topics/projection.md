- A mapping from one coordinate space to another, possibly of a lower dimension. It takes the points of an object onto the points of a fixed plane (the view plane) in such a way that each pair of points is collinear with a fixed point, the centre of projection or eyepoint, which lies neither on the object nor the view plane. The main types of projection are parallel and perspective projections.

- $n$. (in psychology) the attribution of one's own qualities to other people. In psychoanalysis this is considered to be one of the defence mechanisms; people who cannot tolerate their own feelings (e.g. anger) may cope by imagining that other people have those feelings (e.g. are angry).
