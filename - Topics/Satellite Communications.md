- Satellite communications enable the transmission of data or voice signals between two or more points by acting as a relay station. Some benefits of using satellite communications include global coverage, high bandwidth capacity, and secure transmissions. There are also some disadvantages to using satellite communications, such as the cost of setting up and maintaining a satellite network infrastructure and the latency associated with signal transmission.
