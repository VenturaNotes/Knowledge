- The point at which revenue begins to exceed cost. If one graph is drawn to show total revenue plotted against the number of items made and sold and another graph is drawn with the same axes to show total costs, the two graphs normally intersect at the break-even point. To the left of the break-even point, costs exceed revenue and the company runs at a loss; to the right, revenue exceeds costs and the company runs at a profit.
