- $n$. A visual sensation of three-dimensional depth that occurs when two lines or other elements are presented, one to each eye, at positions allowing binocular fusion to occur, and at the same time a third is presented to one of the eyes at a different position, generating a perception in which the fused line appears nearer than the single line. The explanation, and the reason for its being called a limiting case, is that it mimics the stimulus pattern that occurs when two objects at different distances are viewed from such an angle that one of the objects is hidden behind the other from the vantage point of one eye whereas the other eye sees both of them. Also called the Panum phenomenon or the WheatstonePanum limiting case. See also Panum's fusion area, stereopsis. \[Named after the Danish physician and physiologist Peter Ludvig Panum (1820-85) who rediscovered it in 1858, although the English physicist and inventor Sir Charles Wheatstone (1802-75) had already discovered and reported it in 1838]
