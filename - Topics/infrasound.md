- $n$. A pressure wave of the same physical character as sound but with a frequency below the lower limit of the audibility range$\textemdash$below about 16 hertz. Such waves are capable of travelling relatively great distances, and if intense enough, they can induce dysphoria and can even damage internal organs of the body although they cannot be heard. African and Indian elephant families in the wild communicate with sounds that are partly infrasonic, ranging from 35 hertz down to 12 hertz. Compare ultrasound. infrasonic adj. \[From Latin infra below or under + English sound]
