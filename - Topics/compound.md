## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A substance formed when two or more different elements chemically combine in a fixed ratio, creating molecules with atoms of those elements bonded together
- It is a [[pure substance]] made up of multiple types of atoms held together by chemical bonds, like water ($H_2O$) which is made of hydrogen and oxygen atoms bonded together

## Source[^2]
- A compound must have two different elements bonded together.
	- Therefore, diatomic elements are NOT considered compounds
