- An individual's psychological attachment to an organization and desire to remain part of it. It is normally measured by attitudinal dimensions, e.g. identification with the goals and values of the organization; desire to belong to the organization; and willingness to display effort on behalf of the organization. A distinction is sometimes made between affective commitment, which involves a sense of loyalty and shared values, and mere continuance commitment, which arises from inertia or the problems of finding alternative employment. Compare ALIENATION.
