- Single carrier frequency division multiple access (SC-FDMA) is a type of data transfer protocol. It specifically deals with how data is transferred across a network with multiple users. With SC-FDMA, information is transmitted along with adjacent subcarriers. This increases the speed of information transmission. It also decreases the power necessary to move the data. Thus, some people believe SC-FDMA is a favorable data transfer protocol alternative than traditional approaches, such as orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA). Its use in a 3G network is automatic.
