- Defects per million opportunities or DPMO (or nonconformities per million opportunities (NPMO)) is a measure of process performance. This is expressed as the number of defects in a million measurements and defines the number of defects per unit produced by a process. Highly capable processes are those that experience fewer than 3.4 defects per million opportunities.
