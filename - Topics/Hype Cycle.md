- Created by Gartner, Hype Cycle refers to a common five-step pattern in how technological innovations emerge:
	- Innovation trigger: The new technology generates interest and excitement, even without a working consumer product.
	- Peak of inflated expectations: After more publicity, some companies share their success stories using the technology.
	- Trough of disillusionment: Interest wanes in the technology after it fails to deliver on the hype.
	- Slope of enlightenment: The technology sees renewed interest as it becomes more widely understood, with second- and third-generation products released.
	- Plateau of productivity: Use of the technology hits the mainstream.
