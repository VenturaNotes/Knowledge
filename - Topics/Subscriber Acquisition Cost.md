- Subscriber acquisition cost is a organization's calculation of the cost of acquiring new subscribers. To calculate this cost, the cost of sales and the cost of marketing are added together and then divided by the number of new subscribers gained. It is an important metric to businesses of all sizes because it allows them to determine their ROI (return on investment) to ensure that they are making strategic and profitable marketing decisions.
