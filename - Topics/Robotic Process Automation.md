- Robotic process automation or RPA is software that carries out repetitive tasks that replicate human actions. Users can create instructions for a 'bot' to perform duties such as:
	- Retrieving and processing data for financial companies
	- Processing product returns for retailers
	- Streamlining claims and payment cycles for insurance providers
	- Automating prescription management for healthcare providers
	- Completing receivables and payables tasks for accountancy firms
	- Updating employee information and timesheets for human resources departments
- RPA uses automation, machine learning, and computer vision to complete rules-based tasks. A bot mimics the behavior of the human that programs it and then completes the same tasks manually.
