- A measure of the degree of competition within a particular industry. It is calculated as the sum of the squares of the individual market shares of all known players in that industry. The Index is considered a better measure than simple concentration ratios (e.g. the four-firm concentration ratio) because it reflects the distribution of market share throughout an industry while giving greatest weight to that of the largest firms. An index figure of 1,000 or more is usually held to indicate a fairly high level of concentration: although regulatory regimes differ, a merger that caused a further significant rise in the index (say by 50 points) would normally prompt the interest of competition watchdogs.

- A measure of firm size relative to market size used as an indicator of market power. The Herfindahl index is defined as the sum of the squares of market shares of the firms operating in a market, $H=\Sigma_{i} s_{i}^{2}$, where $s_{i}$ is the market share of the $i$th firm. If there are $N$ firms, the lowest value $H$ can take is when all $N$ firms have equal shares, so that $s_{i}=1 / N$ for all $i$, and $H=1 / N$. The highest value $H$ can take is 1 , which is approached as the market share of the largest firm tends to 1 and the market shares of the rest tend to $0 . H$ thus rises as concentration increases. The advantage of the Herfindahl index over the $N$-firm concentration ratio is that it is sensitive to the distribution of market share among firms. See also LERNER INDEX.
