- (1) A commercially valuable product or process that emerges as an unexpected benefit from a research project in another field. For example, the non-stick saucepan coating Teflon (trademark) came from the US space programme. 
- (2) A type of corporate restructuring in which a parent company divests itself of a wholly-owned subsidiary by distributing shares in the latter to its own shareholders, usually on a pro rata basis. The subsidiary thus becomes an independent company. Spin-offs are usually carried out with the aim of increasing shareholder value and making both companies more focused, particularly where the subsidiary underperformed as part of the whole. It is nearly always more tax efficient for a company to spin off a subsidiary in this way than to sell it. Compare CARVE-OUT; SPLIT-OFF.
