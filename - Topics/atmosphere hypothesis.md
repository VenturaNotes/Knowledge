- $n$. The conjecture that errors in judging the validity of syllogisms sometimes arise from a bias in favor of judging a conclusion as valid if it contains the same quantifiers $(1,2)$ or other logical terms as the premises. For example, the following syllogism is often wrongly judged to be valid: Some professors are logicians; Some logicians are absent-minded; Therefore, some professors are absent-minded. The reasons for the plausibility of this invalid syllogism are the repetition of the form Some $P$ are $Q$ and the fact that the conclusion seems plausible.
