- A good or service whose consumption by an individual, at a given price, rises less than in proportion to increases in their income. The income elasticity of demand for a necessity is less than one. Necessities are thus goods on which poorer people spend a larger proportion of their incomes than richer people. A necessity is contrasted with a luxury, which is a good or service whose consumption rises more than in proportion to increases in income. See also Engel Curve.

- $n$. the ethical and legal doctrine that provides justification for doing something that might otherwise be seen as blameworthy when the consequences of not doing so would be worse. For example, doctors have no right to touch a patient without consent, yet might be considered lacking in duty of care if they did not restrain patients who were about to kill themselves. See also PATERNALISM.
