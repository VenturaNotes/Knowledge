- diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid, which when labelled with technetium-99m is used as a tracer to obtain scintigrams of the kidney over a period of time, by means of a gamma camera. DTPA is filtered out of the blood by the kidneys and passes into the urine; it is used to show the function of the kidney and reflux from the bladder up the ureter. It is particularly useful in assessing obstruction to urinary drainage from the kidneys.
