- A career that involves frequent changes of organization, work setting, and job content, as opposed to one that involves commitment to a single organization or line of work. Such a career will be shaped by the individual's own needs, goals, and values rather than by organizational structures or received ideas of professional development. Success will depend on adaptability, self-motivation, and a willingness to learn new skills. It has been argued that the increasing trend towards protean career patterns has radically altered the nature of psychological contracts between organizations and their employees.
