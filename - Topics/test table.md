## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Test tables are used to provide a structure to testing. Programmers will often create a table with a selection of normal, extreme and exceptional data that they intend to use during testing
- The table will include:
	- a column for the expected result
	- a column for what actually happens when the program runs
- The programmer will refer to the [[functional requirements]] created at the [[analysis phase]] to act as a reminder of the inputs that the program is expected to handle.
