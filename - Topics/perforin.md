## Source [^1]
- $n$. a protein produced by cytotoxic T cells and natural killer cells that are in contact with virus-infected target cells. It creates pores in the target-cell membrane, which facilitates the delivery of granzymes to the cell to induce cell death (apoptosis).
## Source[^2]
- A cytotoxic protein occurring in the lytic granules of cytotoxic T cells. When released onto the surface of a target cell by an activated T cell, the perforin molecules polymerize to form a cylindrical pore through the target's plasma membrane, enabling entry of other cytotoxic molecules, such as granzymes and granulysin, which induce programmed cell death (apoptosis).
