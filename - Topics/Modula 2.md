## Source [^1]
- A high-level programming language designed by Wirth (the designer of Pascal) as the programming language for the Lilith personal computer system. Modula 2 is a derivative of Pascal. Its name derives from the fact that a program is made up of modulesâ€”collections of procedures and data objects that exist independently of other modules and have a controlled interface with other modules (compare PACKAGE (as used in Ada)). Modula 2 also provides facilities for describing parallel computations together with their interaction and synchronization
