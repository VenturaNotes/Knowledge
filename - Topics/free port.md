- A port, such as Bremerhaven, Gdansk, Rotterdam, or Singapore, that is free of customs duties. The area around the port, known as a foreign trade zone or free zone, specializes in entrepôt trade, as goods can be landed and warehoused before re-export without the payment of customs duties.

- A seaport or airport where national tariffs are not levied. This is intended to encourage entrepôt trade, as goods can be shipped in and out without having funds tied up in tariff payments and free from the administrative expenses involved in claiming tariff drawbacks when goods are re-exported. Tariffs are payable when goods are shipped from a free port into the rest of the national territory.
