- (helical CT scanning) a development of conventional computerized tomography (CT) scanning in which the X-ray tube rotates continuously around the patient as he or she passes through the scanner. This allows the acquisition of images throughout a specified volume of tissue much more quickly. Since these images are digitally acquired (see DIGITIZATION), post-processing can produce images in numerous planes, without further exposure of the patient to ionizing radiation.
