- $n$. a noise, heard with the aid of a stethoscope, that is generated by turbulent blood flow within the heart or blood vessels. Turbulent flow is produced by damaged valves, septal defects, narrowed arteries, or arteriovenous communications. Heart murmurs can also be heard in normal individuals, especially those who have hyperactive circulation, and frequently in normal children (innocent murmurs). Murmurs are classified as systolic or diastolic (heard in ventricular systole or diastole respectively); continuous murmurs are heard throughout systole and diastole (also known as machinery murmurs because of their characteristic sound).
