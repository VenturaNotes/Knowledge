- $n$. the condition in which an embolus becomes lodged in an artery and obstructs its blood flow. The most common form of embolism is pulmonary embolism, in which a blood clot is carried in the circulation to lodge in the pulmonary artery. An embolus in any other artery constitutes a systemic embolism. In this case a common source of the embolus is a blood clot within the heart in mitral valve disease or following myocardial infarction. The clinical features depend upon the site at which an embolus lodges (for example, a stroke may result from a cerebral embolism and gangrene caused by a limb embolism). Treatment is by anticoagulant therapy with heparin and warfarin. Major embolism is treated by embolectomy or thrombolysis to remove or dissolve the embolus. See also AIR EMBOLISM.
