- The income of a taxpayer from all sources, before any income-tax allowances are deducted. This is often referred to as statutory total income and comprises income from some sources calculated on the basis of the income of the current fiscal year and income from other sources calculated on the basis of the accounting period ending in the current fiscal year. This artificial concept is used to calculate a person's income tax for a given year. See BASIS OF ASSESSMENT.
