- If the density of the vapor phase above a liquid is constant, the molar entropy of vaporization is constant. This law does not hold if molecular association takes place in the liquid or if the liquid is subject to quantum-mechanical effects, e.g. as in superfluidity. The rule is named after the US chemist Joel Henry Hildebrand (1881-1983), who proposed it in 1915.w
