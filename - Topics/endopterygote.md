- Any winged insect having holometabolous development, i.e. the eggs hatch into larvae that are dissimilar to the adults and lack wings. These develop internally before the final moult into a pupa, from which the adult emerges; metamorphosis is described as complete. Endopterygote insects include the beetles (Coleoptera), ants, bees, and wasps (Hymenoptera), flies (Diptera), and butterflies and moths (Lepidoptera). Compare EXOPTERYGOTE.
