## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A structure extending from a neuron which looks like tree branches
- Area where neuron receives most information
## Source[^2]
- $n$. one of the shorter branching processes of the cell body of a neuron, which makes contact with other neurons at synapses and carries nerve impulses from them into the cell body.
## Source[^3]
- Any of the slender branching processes that arise from the dendrons of the cell body of a neuron and transmit nerve impulses to the cell body. Dendrites can be very numerous and form connections (see SYNAPSE) with many other neurons or sensory cells.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. A collection of branched, threadlike extensions of a neuron specialized to receive impulses via synapses (1) from other neurons or from sensory receptors and to conduct them towards the cell body or soma. Also called a dendron . See also microtubule. Compare axon. dendritic adj. \[From Greek dendron a tree]
## Source[^5]
- A crystal that has branched in growth into two parts. Crystals that grow in this way (dendritic growth) have a branching treelike appearance.
