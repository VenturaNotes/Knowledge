- Competition between two or more firms in the same industry that are seeking to increase their shares of the market by cutting the prices of their products. Although this can give short-term advantages in some circumstances to one participant, in the longer run it is a situation from which no one profits. To avoid the perils of selling products at a loss in order to outdo the competition, in most industries prices are not allowed by competitors to fall below a certain level, competition being restricted to other methods, such as advertising, improving the packaging, etc.

- Charging low prices to harm competitors' profits. In a price war one or more firms charge prices below those that would maximize their own profits, to inflict losses on rivals. A price war may aim to punish competitors for breaking a cartel agreement, to weaken their finances in order to force acceptance of a takeover bid, or to drive them out of business completely.
