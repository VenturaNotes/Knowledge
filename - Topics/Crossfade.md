- A crossfade is an audio effect used to smoothly transition between two audio files. Sound engineers create crossfades by using either the analog method or making use of a digital audio editor. The analog crossfading method requires sound engineers to possess two audio inputs. The sound engineer then turns up the volume of one audio input while simultaneously turning down the volume of the other audio input. Modern sound engineers use digital audio editors that are capable of fading out one audio file while simultaneously fading in another. In the entertainment industry, sound engineers often use crossfading to eliminate abrupt transitions in background music in order to create a more pleasant listening experience.
