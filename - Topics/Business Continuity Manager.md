- A business continuity manager (BCM) is responsible for designing and implementing strategies that ensure employers can continue to operate during or after a disaster. These managers develop comprehensive recovery plans, organize rehearsals to test their effectiveness, and monitor employees' compliance with industry regulations. These may also be responsible for identifying risks that could adversely affect businesses, formulating countermeasures, conducting operations audits to identify inefficiencies, and recommending technology solutions that improve security measures and enhance operational efficiency.
