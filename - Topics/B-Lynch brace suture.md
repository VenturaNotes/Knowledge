- a technique in which a compression suture is applied to the uterus, which can be used in cases of severe postpartum haemorrhage as an alternative to an emergency hysterectomy. A pair of vertical sutures are inserted around the uterus to appose the anterior and posterior walls and to apply continuous compression, which stems the bleeding. \[C. Balogun-L ynch (21st century), British obstetrician and gynaecologist]
