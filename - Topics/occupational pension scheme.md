- (superannuation; workplace pension) A pension scheme open to employees within a certain trade or profession or working for a particular firm. An occupational pension scheme can either be insured or self-administered. If it is insured, an insurance company pays the benefits under the scheme in return for having the premiums to invest. In a self-administered scheme, the pension-fund trustees are responsible for investing the contributions themselves. In the UK, workrelated pensions are regulated by the Pensions Regulator. From 2017 UK employers will be legally obliged to enrol all employees who meet certain criteria in a workplace pension scheme and to make contributions; staff who do not wish to be enrolled will have to opt out. See also DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION SCHEME; DEFINED-CONTRIBUTION PENSION SCHEME.
