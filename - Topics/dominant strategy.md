- A strategy for one player in a game which gives a payoff at least as high for them as any other strategy, regardless of the strategy their opponents adopt. If a player has a dominant strategy, then the player will choose to play this strategy. More generally, if strategy $A$ dominates strategy $B$ there is no point in using $B$, so strategy $B$ can be eliminated as a potential equilibrium strategy. The search for the equilibrium of a game can be simplified by recursively eliminating dominated strategies.
