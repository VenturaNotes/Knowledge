- (SLA) The total area of the leaves of a plant divided by the dry mass of the leaves, typically measured in square centimetres per gram or square metres per kilogram. A high value for SLA is typical of fast-growing plants with high photosynthetic capability, whereas a slow-growing or drought-resistant plant would typically have a low SLA. See also LEAF AREA RATIO.
