- (Hallpike test) a test for benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), performed with the patient first sitting upright on an examination couch and then lying supine with the head and neck extended beyond the edge of the couch. The patient's head is rotated to the left (or right) and supported by the examiner while the patient assumes the supine position and keeps his or her eyes focused on the examiner's eyes. The test is then repeated with the other ear facing down. In patients with BPPV, after a short delay rotatory nystagmus is seen, in association with severe vertigo and nausea, which gradually abates. The effect diminishes with repeated manoeuvres. In conditions affecting the cerebellum or brainstem, the nystagmus occurs immediately, in any direction, and does not diminish, and patients do not feel especially nauseated. \[M. R. Dix and C. S. Hallpike (20th century), British otologists]
