## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A unit of software or hardware that interacts with the rest of its system entirely through its interface. The details of how it implements this interface's functionality are completely opaque to the rest of the system. Provided this functionality is not altered in any way, these internal workings can be altered or even completely reconstructed without jeopardizing system stability. Black boxes are an important concept in any large software project and are essential to component-based development.
## Source[^2]
- An element in a system that is effectively opaque to those observing it. Inputs enter one end of the box and emerge, transformed, at the other. In terms of controlling the system, this may be perfectly adequate, however complex the processes might be within the element. The black box may be used as a way of representing the unobservable psychological processes that underlie a consumer's decision making. Researchers must focus on the input to and the output from the black box, as they are unable to observe the processes within it.
