- SAFe (scaled agile framework), is a set of principles, processes, and best practices that assists organizations with the adoption of agile methodologies such as Lean or Scrum. This framework helps development teams stay aligned with objectives of their business, collaborate more effectively, in addition to enabling efficiency throughout the development process. SAFe is centered around three bodies of knowledge: agile software development, lean product development, and systems thinking (an analysis approach that encourages teams to ask better questions to find better answers before jumping to conclusions prematurely). There are four SAFe framework configurations, including Essential, Large Solution, Portfolio, and Full that can be used to govern agile teams. Although SAFe is typically thought of as a framework for larger organizations, it was initially developed for organizations with multiple teams of 5 to 11 people, making it suitable for small organizations (under 100 employees) and midsize organizations (100 to 999 employees).
