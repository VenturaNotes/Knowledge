- A single sign-on is a type of authentication software. It allows users to use one sign-on method to accessÂ multiple programs within a system or network. When utilized properly, a single sign-on can save users time and boost efficiency. This sign-on information only exists in a secure location, adding a layer of security to the organization's network. SSOs can utilize two-factor authentication, further enhancing their overall security impact.
