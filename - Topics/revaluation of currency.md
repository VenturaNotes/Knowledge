- An increase in the value of a currency in terms of gold or other currencies. It is usually made by a government that has a persistent balance of payments surplus. It has the effect of making imports cheaper but exports become dearer and therefore less competitive in a country; revaluation is therefore unpopular with governments. Compare DEVALUATION; REVALORIZATION OF CURRENCY.
