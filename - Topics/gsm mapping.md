- (generalized sequential machine mapping) A function that is the response function of a generalized sequential machine, and therefore generalizes the notion of sequential function. Without constraining the machine to have a finite state-set, generalized sequentiality is equivalent to the following property of initial subwords preservation: 
- for all $u, v$ in $I^{*}, f(u v)$ has the form $f(u) w$ for some $w$ in $O^{*}$, where $I^{*}$ and $O^{*}$ are the sets of all input and output strings.
