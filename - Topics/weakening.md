## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A rule of reasoning that implies that from a clause such as $P \Rightarrow Q$ (where $\Rightarrow$ should be interpreted as 'implies' and $P$ and $Q$ are atoms) one can deduce both $P \vee R \Rightarrow Q$ and $P \Rightarrow Q \vee R$ (where $\vee$ signifies 'or'). In other words, additional antecedents can always be added to a clause in a deduction.
