## Source [^1]
- Mainly used in [[microeconomics]], cardinal utility assigns a numeric value to the consumer's preference, indicating the degree to which one choice ranks above another.
- The cardinal utility will define how much more contestant A was preferred over contestants B and C, and so on

## Source[^2]
- A utility function that can be subjected to a positive affine transformation without altering the implied preference order. A positive affine transformation applied to the initial utility function $U$ generates the transformed utility function $U^{*}=a+b U$, where $b>0$. The utility function $U$ is cardinal if the functions $U$ and $U^{*}$ represent the same set of underlying preferences. An example of cardinal utility is an expected utility function.
