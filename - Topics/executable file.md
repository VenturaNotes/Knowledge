- An executable file (EXE file) is a computer file that contains binary machine code that instructs a computer ªs central processing unit (CPU) how to run a program. Once a computer user clicks on an executable file, it immediately begins to run its code, allowing a program to run on a computer system. On Windows OS devices, compiled programs use the .EXE file extension. On Mac OS devices, compiled programs use the .APP file extension. Businesses often use executable files to download new applications onto their computer systems. Since executable files run code as soon as they are opened, it is important for companies to refrain from opening executable file attachments that they receive as email attachments. Unknown executable files can contain malicious computer code that can infect a computer system as soon as they are opened by a computer user.
