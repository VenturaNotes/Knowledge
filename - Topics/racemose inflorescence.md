- (indefinite inflorescence) A type of flowering shoot (see INFLORESCENCE) in which the growing region at the tip of the flower stalk continues to produce new flower buds during growth. As a result, the youngest flowers are at the top and the oldest flowers are at the base of the stalk. In a flattened inflorescence, the youngest flowers are in the centre and the oldest flowers are on the outside. Types of racemose inflorescence include the capitulum, catkin, corymb, raceme, spadix, spike, and umbel (see illustration). Compare CYMOSE INFLORESCENCE.
