- A rate of exchange between one currency and others that is permitted to float according to market forces. Most major currencies and countries now have floating exchange rates but governments and central banks intervene, buying or selling currencies when rates become too high or too low. Compare FIXED EXCHANGE RATE.
## Source[^2]
- (flexible exchange rate) An exchange rate with no government or central bank action to keep it stable. In a pure or 'clean' float there is no government or central bank intervention at all in the foreign exchange market, and determination of the exchange rate is left to market forces. In a managed or 'dirty' float the monetary authorities of one or both of the countries do intervene in the foreign exchange market, but at their own discretion.
