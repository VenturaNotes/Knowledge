## Source [^1]
- (1) The trading of goods, stocks, shares, commodities, paper currencies, or other financial instruments. 
- (2) The place in which such trading occurs, e.g. a stock exchange or commodities exchange. This may not necessarily have a physical location. 
- (3) An agreement to swap, as in exchange of contracts.
## Source[^2]
- (1) The trade of one good or asset for another. Exchange is the most basic form of economic activity. It requires a coincidence of wants between the two parties: each must want what the other possesses. The process of exchange can be represented in an Edgeworth box. See also VOLUNTARY EXCHANGE.
- (2) A place where trading is carried out: thus shares were traded at the stock exchange, corn was traded at a corn exchange, and workers were hired at a labour exchange. In many cases most of the trade is nowadays done electronically, so that a stock exchange is often an institution rather than a physical place. See also COMMODITY MARKET.
