- (1) The prices at which goods are currently trading in the market.
- (2) A reference to the method of measuring national income at the prices customers pay. Gross domestic product or any other national income accounting aggregate at market prices uses the prices customers pay, including any indirect taxes and subtracting any subsidies. This is contrasted with factor cost, the prices of goods and services actually received by the sellers. To get from market prices to factor cost indirect taxes are subtracted and consumer subsidies added.
