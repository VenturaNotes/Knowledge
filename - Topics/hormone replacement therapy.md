- (HRT) the use of female hormones for the relief of symptoms resulting from cessation of ovarian function, either at the time of the natural menopause or following surgical removal of the ovaries. Oestrogenic hormones may be prescribed orally, transdermally (as skin patches or gel), or by subcutaneous implant. The combination of progestogen with oestrogen is preferred if the woman has retained her uterus, since administration of oestrogen alone might cause overstimulation of the endometrium or even cancer. HRT is effective against vasomotor symptoms (e.g. hot flushes) and genitourinary atrophy (causing vaginal dryness); for the best results it should be started as soon as the symptoms first appear. Because studies indicate that HRT may increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke, and other conditions associated with ageing, it should be used only in the short term (no more than five years) in women over 50 and is no longer recommended for the prevention of osteoporosis.
