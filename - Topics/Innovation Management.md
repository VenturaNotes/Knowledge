- Innovation management is a technique that helps businesses implement new ideas or technologies on an ongoing basis. As companies continue to implement new ideas or technologies, innovation management best practices support the entire process. It all starts at the first stage, where companies discuss and plan the actions they need to take to execute an idea or technology through the final implementation stage. This iterative and innovative process happens over and over again.
