- $n$. a loss of normal muscular tonicity or responsiveness. Akinetic rigid syndrome is used to describe such conditions as parkinsonism and progressive supranuclear palsy. In akinetic epilepsy there is a sudden loss of muscular tonicity, making the patient fall with momentary loss of consciousness. Akinetic mutism is a state of complete physical unresponsiveness although the patient's eyes remain open and appear to follow movements. It is a consequence of damage to the brainstem area of the brain. â€”akinetic adj.
