## Source [^1]
- A technique that approaches a solution by progressive approximation, using the $k$th approximate solution to find the $(k+1)$ th approximate solution (see also Iteration). Examples of methods that rely on iterative improvement are the Jacobi method and Gauss-Seidel method, used in numerical analysis.
