- any one of a class of drugs that act by blocking the action of the enzyme carbonic anhydrase. This enzyme greatly speeds up the reaction between carbon dioxide and water to form carbonic acid, a compound needed for the production of many of the body's secretions. Carbonic anhydrase is present in high concentrations in the eye, kidneys, stomach lining, and pancreas. Carbonic anhydrase inhibitors reduce the production of aqueous humor in the eye and are used mainly in treating glaucoma. They include acetazolamide, brinzolamide, and dorzolamide.
