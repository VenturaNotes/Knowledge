- a radiological technique used to diagnose conditions of the large bowel using the combination of X-ray imaging and radiopaque contrast (barium sulphate). Prior bowel cleansing is usually required with a colonic cleansing preparation. A large-bore tube with a balloon is inserted into the rectum and through this the barium is delivered to the caecum. The balloon is inflated in the rectum to prevent leakage of barium outside. In double contrast studies, air is passed through the catheter to distend the colon. A series of radiographs are taken after barium has coated the colon, and the patient may be asked to change position to ensure that the whole bowel is delineated. Barium enema is used to identify colonic polyps, colorectal cancer, and diverticular disease. However, its role has been largely taken over by colonoscopy which enables additional mucosal sampling and therapeutic intervention.
