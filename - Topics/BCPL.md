- A systems programming language that incorporates the control structures needed for structured programming. Its main distinguishing feature is that it is type-free, i.e. the only type of data object that can be used is a word made up of bits (hence the suitability for systems programming). BCPL was implemented on many machines, but it is now little used. See also B, C, CPL.
