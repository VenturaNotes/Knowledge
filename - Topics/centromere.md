- (kinetochore) $n$. the part of a chromosome that joins the two chromatids to each other and becomes attached to the spindle during mitosis and meiosis. When chromosome division takes place the centromeres split longitudinally.

- (kinomere; spindle attachment) The part of a chromosome that attaches to the spindle during cell division (see MEIosis; Mitosis). It is characterized by highly repetitive DNA. Spindle attachment is via a platelike structure called the kinetochore. The position of the centromere is a distinguishing feature of individual chromosomes: a chromosome with the centromere at its centre is described as metacentric; one with the centromere towards one end is acrocentric; and a chromosome with the centromere at either end is telocentric. The centromere usually appears as a constriction when chromosomes contract during cell division.
