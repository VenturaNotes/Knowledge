- A reduced instruction set computer, or RISC, is a computer that uses a processor that follows a simple architecture. The purpose of this is to improve the performance of the computer by assigning fewer tasks. The alternative to RISC is known as CISC (Complex Instruction Set Computer). A developer may have a personal preference when choosing which processor to use but the key difference is that RISC focuses on optimizing software whereas CISC focuses on the hardware.
