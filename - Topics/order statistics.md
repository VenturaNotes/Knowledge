- Statistic s which depend on their value for the place they occupy in an ordering of the data. So minimum, maximum, median, quartiles, and percentiles are all order statistics.

## Source[^2]
- A branch of statistics that uses not the numerical value of an observation but its ranking relative to other observations. The $r$th order statistic of a sample of $n$ observations is simply the $r$th smallest variate value in the sample. Examples of statistical tests for ordering include: the median test, the sign test, Cochran's test, the Wald-Wolfowitz 'runs test', the Mann-Whitney test, the Wilcoxon test, the Kruskal-Wallis test, and the Friedman test.
