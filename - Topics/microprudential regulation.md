- An approach to the regulation of the financial system that is based on scrutinizing operations at the level of the individual and the firm. Such an approach emphasizes e.g. levels of capital adequacy in banks, the outlawing of unfair or anticompetitive practices, and measures to protect investors and consumers of financial services. Since the financial crisis of 2007-08 microprudential regulation has been increasingly supplemented by macroprudential regulation.
