- the band of electromagnetic radiation that is longer in wavelength than the red of the visible spectrum. Infrared radiation is responsible for the transmission of radiant heat. It may be used in physiotherapy to warm tissues, reduce pain, and improve circulation, but is not as effective as diathermy for deep structures. Special photographic film, which is sensitive to infrared radiation, is used in thermography.
