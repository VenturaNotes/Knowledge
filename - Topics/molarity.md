aliases:
  - molar concentration

## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- (1) A solution with a concentration of 7 mol per L is also denoted as:
	- 7 M
## Source[^2]
- Formula: $M = \frac nv$
	- M = molar concentration
	- n = moles of solute
	- v = liters of solution
## Source[^3]
- Molar concentration is exactly the same as molarity
- Both terms refer to the number of [[mole|moles]] of [[solute]] per liter of solution
## Source[^4]
- $n$. the strength of a solution, expressed as the weight of dissolved substance in grams per litre divided by its molecular weight, i.e. the number of moles per litre. Molarity is indicated as $0.1 \mathrm~{M}, 1 \mathrm~{M}, 2 \mathrm~{M}$, etc.
