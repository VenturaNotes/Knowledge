- The requirement of the Equality Act 2010 (and before that of the Equal Pay Act 1970) that men and women in the same employment must be paid at the same rate for like work or work rated as equivalent. Work is rated as equivalent when the employer has undertaken a study to evaluate his employees' jobs in terms of the skill, effort, and responsibility demanded of them and the woman's job is given the same grade as the man's or when an independent expert appointed by an employment tribunal evaluates the two jobs as of equal value.

- As specified in the UK legislation by the Equal Pay Act of 1970, amended by the Equal Pay (Amendment) Regulations 1983, the principle that provides for equal pay between women and men in the same employment by giving a woman the right to equal pay in her contract of employment where she is employed on like work to that of a man, or work rated equivalent to that of a man, or work of equal value to that of a man; similar legal requirements are in place in many other countries. More generally, a principle that the pay for given work should be independent of the sex, race, religion, age, or other personal characteristics of the worker.
