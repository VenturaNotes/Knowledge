- The requirement of the Equality Act 2010 (and before that of the Equal Pay Act 1970) that men and women in the same employment must be paid at the same rate for like work or work rated as equivalent. Work is rated as equivalent when the employer has undertaken a study to evaluate his employees' jobs in terms of the skill, effort, and responsibility demanded of them and the woman's job is given the same grade as the man's or when an independent expert appointed by an employment tribunal evaluates the two jobs as of equal value.
