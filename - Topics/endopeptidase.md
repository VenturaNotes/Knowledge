## Source [^1]
- $n$. a digestive enzyme (e.g. pepsin) that splits a whole protein into small peptide fractions by splitting the linkages between peptides in the interior of the molecule. Compare EXOPEPTIDASE. See also PEPTIDASE.
## Source[^2]
- A protein-digesting enzyme that cleaves a polypeptide chain at specific sites between amino acids. For example, chymotrypsin cleaves the chain next to aromatic amino acids, such as phenylalanine; trypsin cleaves the chain next to basic amino acids, such as lysine or arginine; and pepsin cleaves the chain next to tyrosine and phenylalanine. Compare EXOPEPTIDASE.
