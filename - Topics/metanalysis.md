- $n$. The formation of a new word through a mistaken analysis of a boundary between existing words. A typical example is the word adder, derived from Middle English naddre through people mishearing the phrase a naddre as an adder. A second example is the word apron, derived from a mistaken division into an apron of the Middle English a napron, from Old French naperon a little cloth, from Latin nappa a napkin. Often confused with meta-analysis. Compare BACK FORMATION, FOLK ETYMOLOGY (2). \[From Greek meta beside or beyond + English analysis]
