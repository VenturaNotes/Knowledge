- necrosis of the lunate bone of the wrist caused by interruption of its blood supply (see OSTEOCHONDRITIS; OSTEONECROSIS). It usually follows chronic stress or injury to the wrist and presents with pain and stiffness, with reduced grip strength. Initially, X-rays may show no abnormality; if the disease is suspected, a bone scan or MRI is indicated. Treatment is with rest, splintage, and NSAIDs, but some cases require surgical shortening of the radius or arthrodesis of the wrist. \[R. Kienb√∂ck (1871-1953), Austrian radiologist]
