- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a form of neurosis that does not have its origin in infantile conflicts but in the present, the symptoms resulting directly from the absence or inadequacy of sexual satisfaction and not appearing as symbolic forms of expression. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), who introduced the concept in 1898 in an article on 'Sexuality in the Aetiology of the Neuroses' (Standard Edition, III, pp. 263-85, at p. 279), originally identified anxiety neurosis (generalized anxiety disorder) and neurasthenia as the actual neuroses, and he later added hypochondria. Compare PSYCHONEUROSIS. \[From German aktual present-day]
