- A model used to value businesses or shares based on applying a present-value formula to future dividends. It assumes that the value of shares is the present value of future dividends, which will grow at a fixed rate $g$, and is expressed in the formula: $$P_{t}=D_{i}+1 /(r-g),$$where $P_{t}$ is the value of a share or business in time period $t ; D_{i}+1$ is the value of the dividend in time period $t$ plus one time period; $r$ is the appropriate present value discount rate; and $g$ is the growth rate of dividends per time period. The formula will only work if $r$ is greater than $g$, which will be the case for mature companies.
