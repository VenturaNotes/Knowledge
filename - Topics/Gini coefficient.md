- A statistical measure of inequality. For a population of $H$ individuals with mean income $\mu$ the Gini coefficient, $G$, is defined by$$G=1-\frac{1}{H^{2} \mu} \sum_{i=1}^{H} \sum_{j=1}^{H} \min \left\{M^{i}, M^{j}\right\}$$where $M^{h}$ is the income of individual $h$. A value of 0 for the Gini coefficient denotes complete equality, and a value of 1 maximal inequality, i.e. all income is received by a single individual. Using the Lorenz curve diagram, the Gini coefficient can be found as the ratio of the area between the Lorenz curve and the straight line connecting the ends of the Lorenz curve to the total area under this straight line.
