- $n$. the investigation of the function of the lower urinary tract. It involves the recording of pressures within the bladder during filling and voiding by the use of special equipment that can also record urethral sphincter pressures. Simultaneously, abdominal pressure is usually recorded with a catheter in the rectum, vagina, or ileal conduit. It is an essential investigation in the study of urinary incontinence. In some men, urodynamic studies are necessary to determine if their lower urinary tract symptoms are caused by bladder outlet obstruction or detrusor instability.
