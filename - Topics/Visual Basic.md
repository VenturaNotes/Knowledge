- A system for rapid development of Microsoft Windows applications. The user designs a visual interface by selecting 'controls' (e.g. menus, dialogue boxes) from a predefined palette, and then provides code in a dialect of Basic to specify the actions for each control in response to user input. The latest version is Visual Basic 2005 (see Visual BASIC .NET).
## Source[^2]
- Visual Basic (VB) is a programming language developed by Microsoft. This programming language has evolved over the years. Programmers used the original language—sometimes called Visual Basic "classic"—from 1991 through 2008. The current and most popular version, launched in 2002, is called Visual Basic for Applications, or VBA. It can make it easier to code certain types of applications called type-safe .NET apps. Today, most Microsoft Office programs use VBA. However, this language will only work when used within a host program such as Microsoft Word or Excel. That means it's not available as a standalone program. VBA can also control one application from another application. For example, programmers can create a Word report from Excel data.
