## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A design principle for the deployment of software that focuses on the operational capabilities that the software provides, rather than on the software itself. This notably allows for applications that realize services on behalf of others (see SAAS). In service-oriented architecture, services may actually and most often be based on different platforms. The paradigm for SOA is called service orientation.
## Source[^2]
- Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a method of designing and building large technical software applications. It is also an underlying structure that supports specific purposes in website applications and information systems. Software engineers and IT personnel value SOAÂ as an adaptable tool that can be integrated into an existing platform or infrastructure.
