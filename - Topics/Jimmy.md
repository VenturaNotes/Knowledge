- $n$. A nickname used by psychologists to refer to the best-selling textbook Psychology: Briefer Course (1892) by the US psychologist William James (1842-1910). His monumental two-volume Principles of Psychology appeared in 1890, after a gestation period of 12 years, and comments such as You'll find it in James were so common that the book gradually came to be known as James. When the abridged version appeared in 1892, it was immediately nicknamed Jimmy.
