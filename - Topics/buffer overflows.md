## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Refers to a software coding error where a program attempts to write more data into a designated memory area (called a [[buffer]]) than it can hold, causing excess data to spill over and overwrite adjacent memory locations, potentially allowing attackers to inject malicious code and gain control of the system
- A vulnerability that occurs when too much data is put into a container that doesn't have enough space, leading to potential security risks

## Source[^2]
- Also known as a buffer overrun. Occurs when the amount of data in the buffer exceeds its storage capacity
