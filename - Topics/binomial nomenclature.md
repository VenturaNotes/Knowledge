- The system of naming organisms using a two-part Latinized (or scientific) name that was devised by the Swedish botanist Linnaeus (Carl Linn√©); it is also known as the Linnaean system. The first part is the generic name (see GENUS), the second is the specific epithet or name (see SPECIES). The Latin name is usually printed in italics, starting with a capital letter. For example, in the scientific name of the common frog, Rana temporaria, Rana is the generic name and temporaria the specific name. The name of the species may be followed by an abbreviated form of the name of its discoverer; for example, the common daisy is Bellis perennis L. (for Linnaeus). There are several International Codes of Taxonomic Nomenclature that lay down the rules for naming organisms. See also classification; taxonomy
