- The distribution of the different species of a community into separate zones, which are created by variations in the environment. A clear example of zonation occurs on a rocky shore, where different species of seaweed (Fucus) occupy different zones, according to their ability to withstand desiccation. For example, the species found in the splash zone, which is never completely submerged in water, is better adapted to exposure than those found in zones lower down the shore, where they are submerged for longer periods. Animals, particularly stationary species, such as barnacles, also exhibit zonation on a rocky shore; as with the seaweeds, this may depend on the ability of different species to withstand desiccation. Competition between species may also contribute to zonation.
