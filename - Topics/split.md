## Source [^1]
- One of the basic actions applicable to a set $S$ on whose elements a total ordering $\le$ is defined; when applied in the form $$\text{split}(a, S)$$where $a$ is a member of $S$, $S$ is partitioned into two disjoint sets $S_1$ and $S_2$: all the elements in $S_1$ are less than or equal to $a$ and all those in $S_2$ are greater than $a$.
