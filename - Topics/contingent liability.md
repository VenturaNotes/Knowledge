- A liability which will only arise in certain specific circumstances. For example, a guarantee of somebody else's debts will have to be honored only if they fail to pay up. Insurance companies incur contingent liabilities when they issue fire or accident insurance policies: they will have to pay out only if policy-holders suffer fires or accidents. Contingent liabilities create problems for accountants in valuing businesses, particularly with contingencies whose likelihood is difficult to assess.

- (contingent loss) 
- (1) A possible obligation that arises from past events, whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within an entity's control. For example, if there is a substantial legal claim for damages against a company, there is a contingent liability (depending on the outcome of the claim). 
- (2) A present obligation that arises from past events in which either the amount of the obligation cannot be measured reliably or it is not probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Generally, an entity should disclose a contingent liability but not recognize it as a liability. Compare CONTINGENT ASSET. See also CONTINGENT LOSS.
