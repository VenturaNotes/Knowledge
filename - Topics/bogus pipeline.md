- $n$. A technique designed to reduce response bias in self-report measures of attitudes or emotions by convincing the respondent that the researcher has a reliable and valid means, usually in the form of a sham lie detector attached to the respondent's body, of checking the truthfulness of the verbal responses. The technique was introduced by the US psychologists Edward Ellsworth Jones (1926-93) and Harold Sigall (born 1943) in an article in the journal Psychological Bulletin in 1971. See also NON-REACTIVE MEASURE.
