- (quasi money) An asset that is immediately transferable and may be used to settle some but not all debts, although it is not as liquid as banknotes and coins. Bills of exchange are examples of near money. Near money is not included in the money supply definitions.
## Source[^2]
- Securities which are very close substitutes for money. Short-dated securities with a government guarantee which are either marketable, or redeemable by the government at short notice, are such substitutes. They are not themselves money, but are so near to being money that their existence reduces the demand to hold money proper.
