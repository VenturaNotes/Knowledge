- A supporting framework that lies entirely within the body of an animal, such as the bony skeleton of vertebrates or the spicules of a sponge. The function of an endoskeleton is to support the body and in vertebrates it also protects the organs and provides a system of levers on which the muscles can act to produce movement. Compare EXOSKELETON.
