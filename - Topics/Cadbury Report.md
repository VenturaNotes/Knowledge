- A report on the financial aspects of corporate governance in the UK issued in 1992 by a committee under Sir Adrian Cadbury. The so-called Cadbury Code of best practice recommended that non-executive directors should be appointed for specified terms and reappointment should not be automatic, that such directors should be selected through a formal process, and that both their selection and their appointment should be a matter for the board as a whole. Together with the recommendations of the Greenbury Report and the Hampel Report, the Cadbury Code laid the foundations of the Corporate Governance Code, first issued in 1998.
