- $n$. an antibacterial drug that is active against a range of microorganisms; it is used mainly in the treatment of chronic urinary-tract infections and respiratory-tract infections. Long-term treatment may cause anaemia due to deficiency of folate, with which the drug interacts (see DIHYDROFOLATE REDUCTASE INHIBITOR). Trimethoprim is also administered in a combined preparation with sulfamethoxazole (see CO-TRIMOXAZOLE) but is now more usually prescribed alone, because of the severity of the side-effects of co-trimoxazole.
