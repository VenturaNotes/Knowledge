- (RAJAR) A UK organization that measures radio audiences and provides information on their listening habits. Its research is based on quota sampling of listeners aged 15 or over living within a station's designated area. Participants record details of their radio listening in 15-minute periods in specially designed seven-day diaries. Other data about where and how they listen (e.g. over the Internet) is also collected. RAJAR is jointly owned by the BBC and the trade body representing commercial radio.
