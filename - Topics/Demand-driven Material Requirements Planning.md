- Demand-driven material requirements planning (DDMRP) is a comprehensive method for optimizing operational supply-chain planning and execution. DDMRP replaces the use of the conventional, forecast-driven MRP and instead considers the actual sales orders. DDMRP methodology combines relevant elements of traditional MRP and distribution requirements planning (DRP) with pull-based approaches and signals of Lean and the theory of constraints. The complete planning and execution methodology of DDMRP includes progression through these components: strategic inventory positioning, buffer profiles and levels, dynamic adjustments, demand-driven planning, and visible and collaborative execution.
