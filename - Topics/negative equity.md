- (1) The difference between the value of a property (usually residential) and the outstanding amount borrowed against it where the latter is the greater. For example, if a property's current market value is $£ 250,000$ and the borrowing against it is $£ 260,000$, there is a negative equity to the extent of $£ 10,000$. Negative equities were common in the mid1990s when the economic recession had an adverse effect on property prices. House owners who paid more for their houses than their current market value were unable to sell without realizing the loss. 
- (2) More generally, any asset that has a market value below the sum of money borrowed to purchase it.

- The position of the owner of an asset the value of which is less than the amount of debt secured by a mortgage on it. For example, a house owner with a mortgage of $£ 100000$ on a house whose market value is only $£ 90000$ has negative equity of $£ 10000$. The providers of mortgage finance do not lend more than they believe the security is worth, but negative equity can occur if house prices fall after a mortgage is taken out, as occurred in the UK in the early 1990s and the late 2000s, or if borrowers get into arrears on their repayments.
