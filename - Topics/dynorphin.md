## Source [^1]
- A peptide produced as a neurotransmitter in various parts of the brain and spinal cord that binds to kappa opioid receptors. The dynorphins are thus classed as endogenous opioids (with the endorphins and enkephalins), causing analgesia (pain relief) among other effects. They are thought to play a role in depression and certain types of drug addiction.
