- a surgical operation for delivering a baby through the abdominal wall. The operation most commonly performed is lower uterine segment Caesarean section (LUSCS), carried out through a transverse incision in the lower portion of the uterus (see LOWER UTERINE SEGMENT). Classical Caesarean section, in which the upper segment of the uterus is incised vertically, is now rarely performed. In addition to its use in cases of obstructed labour, malpresentation (breech, brow, and shoulder), and in severe antepartum haemorrhage, Caesarean section is being performed increasingly when the baby is at risk and is exhibiting signs of distress. Because of improved techniques in perinatal care, particularly of the preterm baby, the operation may be performed, if necessary, as soon as the child is viable.
