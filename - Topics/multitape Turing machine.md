- A Turing machine that has a finite number of tapes, each tape having a tape head that can move independently. Such machines have the same computational power as single-tape Turing machines. Consider a multitape Turing machine M. If for no input word of length $n$ does M scan more than $L(n)$ cells on any tape then M is said to be an $\mathbf{L ( n )}$ tape-bounded Turing machine. If for no input word of length $n$ does M make more than $T(n)$ moves before halting then M is said to be a $\mathbf{T ( n )}$ time-bounded Turing machine.
