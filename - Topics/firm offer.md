- An offer to sell goods that remains in force for a stated period. For example, an "offer firm for 24 hours" binds the seller to sell if the buyer accepts the offer within 24 hours. If the buyer makes a lower bid during the period that the offer is firm, the offer ceases to be valid. An offer that is not firm is usually called a quotation.
