- $n$. Attributing to inanimate objects feelings, dispositions, and reactions that can be manifested only by animate creatures or human beings, as when a person accuses a computer of being vindictive for deleting an important file. It is a mistake rather than a fallacy, because it does not arise from any invalid form of reasoning. The term was first used in 1843 by the English author and art critic John Ruskin (1819-1900) in Volume 3, part iv, chapter xii, section 5 of his book Modern Painters. Compare ANTHROPOMORPHISM. \[From Latin patheticus sensitive, from Greek pathetikos sensitive, from pathos suffering, related to penthos sorrow]
