- (diminishing increment sort) A sorting algorithm proposed by Donald Shell in 1959 and published as shellsort. It is a variant of straight insertion sort that allows records to take long leaps rather than move one position at a time. It does this by sorting each group $G^{\left(i\right)}\!_j$ of records a distance $h_{\mathrm{i}}$ apart within the file. (The $G^{\left(i\right)}\!_j$ are disjoint and together contain all the information in the file.) This is repeated for a decreasing sequence of values $h_{\mathrm{i}}$, and consequently increasing number of groups $G^{\left(\mathrm{i}\right)}\!_j$, finally ending with $h_{\mathrm{i}}=1$.
