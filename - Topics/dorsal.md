- Describing the surface of a plant or animal that is farthest from the ground or other support, i.e. the upper surface. In vertebrates, the dorsal surface is that down which the backbone runs. Thus in upright (bipedal) mammals, such as humans and kangaroos, it is the backward-directed (posterior) surface. Compare VENTRAL.
## Source[^3]
- adj. Of, relating to, or situated towards the spine, except in the human forebrain, where dorsal is synonymous with superior or top, as if humans walked on all fours and the cerebrum were not bent forwards 80 degrees relative to the brainstem to keep it horizontally oriented when standing upright. Compare ventral. \[From Latin dorsum the back]
