## Source[^1]
- Generally refers to address that identifies a specific network segment
- Network address often derived from an [[IP addresses|IP address]] and its [[subnet mask]].
- Example
	- If you have an IP address of 192.168.1.10 with a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, the network address would be 192.168.1.0
		- This address represents the entire network and not a specific device
