## Synthesis
- It is not considered an official networking term
- However, it is widely used in the context of networking to describe network delay or high latency
- Particularly in gaming where noticeable delays are often referred to as "lag"
	- The official term for this delay is "latency" or "ping"
## Source[^1]
- Lag is the result of high ping or high latency
	- Essentially means your internet connection is at a lower speed or quality than it should be
## Source[^2]
- The time difference between the pairs of observations used in calculating the autocorrelation of a sequence. For a monthly time series the important lags are likely to be 1 (the most recent performance), 3, 6, and 12, reflecting the performance at corresponding points in the business cycle
