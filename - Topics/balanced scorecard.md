- A balanced scorecard (or BSC) is a method of presenting various business metrics that goes beyond purely financial measures and looks at various drivers across a company. For example, in addition to sales, a BSC may show customer engagement, customer satisfaction, or even employee satisfaction. BSCs are created with business strategy and goals in mind and the measures included should take a holistic approach to achieving those goals. A BSC should show companies fairly simply where they are succeeding and where they need to make improvements.
