- In computing, a community cloud is a modified or hybrid variant of a private cloud. It is a multi-tenant virtual technology platform that enables a few limited organizations from one particular community, like the banking sector, with a common agenda and common concerns to work collaboratively on a shared platform, with shared resources and infrastructure. The community may share common regulatory and operational requirements. A third-party cloud services provider could host a community cloud. It is hosted in a data center and can be off-site or on-site. Community clouds are relatively newer than other cloud models like private, public, or hybrid clouds. With online working becoming popular during the pandemic, community clouds have gained popularity.
