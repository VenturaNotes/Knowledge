- A group of water-soluble vitamins that characteristically serve as components of coenzymes. Plants and many microorganisms can manufacture B vitamins but dietary sources are essential for most animals. Heat and light tend to destroy B vitamins.
- Vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{1}$ (thiamin(e)) is a precursor of the coenzyme thiamine pyrophosphate, which functions in the Krebs cycle and carbohydrate metabolism. Deficiency leads to beriberi in humans and to polyneuritis in birds. Good sources include whole-grain or fortified cereals, beans, peas, and nuts.
- Vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{2}$ (riboflavin) occurs in green vegetables, yeast, liver, and milk. It is a constituent of the coenzymes FAD and FMN, which have an important role in the metabolism of all major nutrients as well as in the oxidative phosphorylation reactions of the electron transport chain. Deficiency of $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ causes inflammation of the tongue and lips, mouth sores, and conjunctivitis.
- Vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{6}$ (pyridoxine) is widely distributed in cereal grains, yeast, liver, milk, etc. It is a constituent of a coenzyme (pyridoxal phosphate) involved in amino acid 
- Vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{12}$ (cyanocobalamin or cobalamin) is manufactured only by microorganisms and natural sources are entirely of animal origin. Liver is especially rich in it. One form of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ functions as a coenzyme in a number of reactions, including the oxidation of fatty acids and the synthesis of DNA. It also works in conjunction with folic acid (another B vitamin) in the synthesis of the amino acid methionine and it is required for normal production of red blood cells. Vitamin $B_{12}$ can only be absorbed from the gut in the presence of a glycoprotein called intrinsic factor; lack of this factor or deficiency of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ results in pernicious anaemia.metabolism. Deficiency can cause anaemia, dermatitis, fatigue, and other signs.
- Other vitamins in the B complex include nicotinic acid, pantothenic acid, biotin, and lipoic acid. See also CHOLINE; INOSITOL.
