- pl. n. two individuals who are born at the same time and of the same parents. Fraternal (or dizygotic) twins are the result of the simultaneous fertilization of two egg cells; they may be of different sexes and are no more alike than ordinary siblings. Identical (or monozygotic) twins result from the fertilization of a single egg cell that subsequently divides to give two separate fetuses. They are of the same sex and otherwise genetically identical; any differences in their appearance are due to environmental influences. All dizygotic twins and about one-third of monozygotic twins are dichorionic (i.e. they develop within separate chorionic membranes). About two-thirds of monozygotic twins are monochorionic, sharing a chorion. See CHORIONICITY. See also CONJOINED TWINS.

- Two individuals born to the same mother at the same time. Twins can develop from the same egg (see IDENTICAL TWINS) or from two separately fertilized eggs (see fraterNAL TWINS).
