- An authentication code appended to a file that indicates the author of the file. Most digital signatures use public key encryption. A checksum derived from the document is encrypted using the author's private key and attached to the file. If decrypted using the corresponding public key supplied by the author, this will match the recomputed checksum; if decrypted using any other key, it will not. Digital signatures are very important for verifying the source not only of electronic documents but also of software components. See also CERTIFICATE.

- A digital signature is a type of e-signature that relies on an encryption method. A digital signature uses public-key cryptography. This is a type of cryptography in which pairs of encoded keys are used. Information can only be decoded if someone possesses the key. When used appropriately, this signature can confirm the identity of the sender of the information. It adds another layer of trust to the exchange of electronic information.
