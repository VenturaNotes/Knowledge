## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A solid that is so strongly anisotropic that it can be regarded as being either one-dimensional or two-dimensional. A one-dimensional solid is regarded as a chain, and a two-dimensional solid is regarded as a layer. The magnetic properties of low-dimensional solids are of particular interest as they can be used to check the results of exact solutions for models such as the Ising model in low dimensions.
