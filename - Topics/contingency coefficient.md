- $n$. In statistics, a measure of association between two categorical variables, applicable to a contingency table of any size. It is based on the chi-square distribution and ranges from 0 (no association) to 1 (perfect association) and is calculated by dividing the chi-square value for the table by the chi-square value plus the number of observations and then extracting the square root. Compare Cram√©r's $C$, phi Coefficient.
