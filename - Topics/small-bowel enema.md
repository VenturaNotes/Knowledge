- (enteroclysis) a radiological technique for examining the jejunum and ileum by passing a tube through the nose, oesophagus, and stomach into the small bowel and directly injecting barium sulphate. Images are captured in real time as the contrast moves through the small bowel. It produces highly detailed images of the small bowel, making it particularly useful for investigating coeliac disease and Crohn's disease, as well as strictures, tumours, and obstructions. It can be combined with X-ray imaging, CT, or MRI.
