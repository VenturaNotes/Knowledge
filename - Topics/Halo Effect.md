- The halo effect is a phenomenon in which a consumerʻs positive experience with a certain line of products sold by a particular brand causes them to favor other products made by the same company. This occurs completely independent of the consumerʻs actual experience with other products made by their favorite brand. They simply assume that just because they like a product made by a certain brand, that other products made by that brand will prove more satisfactory than similar products made by a different brand. Therefore, the concept of brand loyalty can be considered a direct result of the halo effect. The halo effect helps businesses gain market share and increase company revenue, as it prevents customers from purchasing products from competitors, even if the competitorʻs product is of better quality.
