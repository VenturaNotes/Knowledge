- The halo effect is a phenomenon in which a consumerʻs positive experience with a certain line of products sold by a particular brand causes them to favor other products made by the same company. This occurs completely independent of the consumerʻs actual experience with other products made by their favorite brand. They simply assume that just because they like a product made by a certain brand, that other products made by that brand will prove more satisfactory than similar products made by a different brand. Therefore, the concept of brand loyalty can be considered a direct result of the halo effect. The halo effect helps businesses gain market share and increase company revenue, as it prevents customers from purchasing products from competitors, even if the competitorʻs product is of better quality.

- $n$. In person perception, a generalization from the perception of one prominent or salient characteristic, trait, or personality attribute to an impression of the personality as a whole, leading to inflated correlations between rated characteristics. The effect was first reported by the US psychologist Frederick Lyman Wells (1884-1964) in a study of ratings of the literary merit of authors published in the Archives of Psychology in 1907. The US psychologist Edward Lee Thorndike (1874-1949) introduced the term halo error in 1920. The term is sometimes restricted to instances in which it leads to an overvaluation of the personality as a whole. See also ATMOSPHERE EFFECT, TRAIT CENTRALITY.
