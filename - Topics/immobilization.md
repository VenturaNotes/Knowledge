- $n$. the procedure of making a normally movable part of the body, such as a joint, immovable. This helps infected, diseased, or injured tissue (bone, joint, or muscle) to heal. Immobilization may be temporary (for example, by means of a plaster of Paris cast on a limb) or it may be permanent. Permanent immobilization of a joint is achieved by means of arthrodesis.
