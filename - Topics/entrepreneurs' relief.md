- A capital gains tax relief introduced from 6 April 2008, when it replaced taper relief and indexation allowance. Under the relief, gains arising from the disposal of all or part of a business are charged at an effective rate of $10 \%$, rather than the top rate of $20 \%$ : the relief can be claimed more than once, up to a lifetime total of $Â£ 1 \mathrm{M}$ of gains qualifying for relief. In April 2016 the relief was extended to long-term investors in unlisted trading companies..
