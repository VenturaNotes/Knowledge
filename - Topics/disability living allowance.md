- (DLA) (in Britain) a state benefit payable to help with the extra costs of looking after a child under the age of 16 with special needs. It has two components: a care component, payable at three rates to children needing help with personal care; and a mobility component, payable at two rates to those aged 3 years or over who need help with walking. The rates depend on the level of help required. DLA for adults aged 16-64 years has been replaced by the personal independence payment (PIP). People aged over 65 years with a disability and requiring help may be eligible for the attendance allowance.
