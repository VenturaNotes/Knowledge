## Synthesis
- Primary function is to assist in the localization of sound sources.
	- Processes differences in the arrival time of sound signals between the ears
	- Timing differences determine direction and distance of sound source relative to listener
- Functions as a major relay station for auditory infromtion traveling from one side of the brainstem to the other
	- Enables communication between two sides of brain stem which is essential for
		- Sound localization (difference in arrival time and intensity of sound to deterimne direction of source)
		- Binocular hearing (use two ears for better acuity)
- Involved in relaying and processing auditory signals for proper hearing and sound perception
## Source [^1]
- Located in the caudal pons.
