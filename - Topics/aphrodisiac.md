## Source[^2]
- adj. n. (Of or relating to) any substance such as amyl nitrite, bufotenin, cantharides, ginkgo, ginseng, L-dopa, or yohimbine that stimulates or excites sexual desire. A central nervous system depressant drug such as alcohol tends to lower sexual inhibitions, cannabis generally increases the intensity of sensations, including sexual sensations, and empathogens such as ecstasy (2) or GHB cause people to feel intensely benevolent to one another, but such substances are not true aphrodisiacs, because they do not directly affect sexual desire. Compare anAPHRODISIAC. \[From Greek aphrodisiakos aphrodisiac, from Aphrodite the Greek goddess of love]
