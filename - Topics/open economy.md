- An economy in which a significant percentage of its goods and services are traded internationally and a significant percentage of total domestic spending is on imports from abroad. The degree of openness of an economy depends on the amount of overseas trade in which the country is involved or the policies of its government. Thus the UK economy is relatively open, as the economy is significantly dependent on foreign trade, while the US economy is relatively closed, as imports are not important to its economy.
