## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An economy in which a significant percentage of its goods and services are traded internationally and a significant percentage of total domestic spending is on imports from abroad. The degree of openness of an economy depends on the amount of overseas trade in which the country is involved or the policies of its government. Thus the UK economy is relatively open, as the economy is significantly dependent on foreign trade, while the US economy is relatively closed, as imports are not important to its economy.
## Source[^2]
- An economy which has transactions with the rest of the world. These may include trade in goods and services, movements of capital, transfers of information and technical know-how, and migration of labour. Most economies are at least partially open for some of these forms of contact. See also AUTARCHY; CLOSED ECONOMY.
