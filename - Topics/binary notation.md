- A way of writing numbers using two symbols only. The symbols are usually written as 0 and 1 , and called binary digits or bits. These bits are usually grouped in eights, called bytes. Numbers written in binary notation are generally much longer than their decimal equivalents. For example, the binary number 1111 is equivalent to the decimal number 15. In a binary number the columns from the right represent 'units', 'twos', 'fours', 'eights', and so on. Binary notation is used in computing because digital computers represent numbers in terms of the presence (1) or absence (0) of an electrical pulse.
