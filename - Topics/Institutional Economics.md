- The analysis of economics from a perspective which stresses the importance of institutions in determining how economies function. For example, the rules of land ownership are important in economic development in less developed countries, and the lack of clearly defined and enforced property rights proved a handicap in the transformation from planned to market economies. Institutional economics includes the analysis of economic influences on institutional rules themselves.
