- Selfless concern for others. Standard economic analysis assumes decision-makers are motivated by self-interest. This assumption is inconsistent with many observed economic choices such as contributions to charities that do not provide any direct benefit to the donor. The concept of altruism has been invoked to explain these observations. It is questionable whether altruism can be incorporated in an economic framework since, if there is any increase in utility from an act of altruism, the act cannot be purely selfless.

- $n$. In social psychology and sociobiology, behavior that benefits another individual or other individuals in terms of direct advantages or chances of survival and reproduction at some cost to the benefactor. See also alarm signal, prosocial behaviour, reciprocal altruism. altruist $n$. One who acts with altruism. altruistic adj. Compare selfish. \[French altruisme, from Italian altrui others, from Latin alteri huic to this other]

- Behavior by an animal that decreases its chances of survival or reproduction while increasing those of another member of the same species. For example, a lapwing puts itself at risk by luring a predator away from the nest through feigning injury, but by so doing saves its offspring. Altruism in its biological sense does not imply any conscious benevolence on the part of the performer. Altruism can evolve through kin selection, if the recipients of altruistic acts tend on average to be more closely related to the altruist than the population as a whole. Some animals perform altruistic acts in the expectation that the 'favour' will be returned in the future. This reciprocal altruism often involves unrelated individuals; it is a complex survival strategy that is practised most notably by humans. See also ALARM SIGNAL; INCLUSIVE FITNESS.
