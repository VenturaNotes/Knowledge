- Selfless concern for others. Standard economic analysis assumes decision-makers are motivated by self-interest. This assumption is inconsistent with many observed economic choices such as contributions to charities that do not provide any direct benefit to the donor. The concept of altruism has been invoked to explain these observations. It is questionable whether altruism can be incorporated in an economic framework since, if there is any increase in utility from an act of altruism, the act cannot be purely selfless.
