- depression that starts after childbirth. Bonding between the mother and child can be impaired (particularly in the case of male children), leading to attachment disorders if the illness is not diagnosed and treated. Postnatal depression occurs in about 10% of women (in the UK women are routinely screened for it after childbirth) and responds to the treatment strategies used for other forms of depression, such as antidepressant medication and cognitive behavioural therapy; in rare cases hospital admission is needed, ideally to a mother-and-baby unit. Compare BABY BLUES; PUERPERAL PSYCHOSIS.
