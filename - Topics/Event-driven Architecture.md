- Event-driven architecture (EDA) is a software design approach in which a software component executes in response to receiving one or more event notifications. Events, or a change caused by a user's action, trigger the services, or operations, of the software. One example of an event is a new user clicking the sign-up button that creates an account. EDA components include events, a service/event handler, event loops, and event flow layers.
