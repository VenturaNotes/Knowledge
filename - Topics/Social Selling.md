- Social selling is a reference to social media. Specifically, it impacts the way social media is used in the sales and lead generation process. Businesses can use social selling by creating appropriate social media content, which can inspire more customers to purchase products. Social selling is typically used by marketing or sales departments and, depending on the type of content and number of platforms, it may require extensive, company-wide coordination. Social selling usually has three specific aspects: positively engaging prospects, building relationships, and moving prospects through a sales funnel.
