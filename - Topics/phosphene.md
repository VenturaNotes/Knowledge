The perception of a flash of light resulting from anything other than excitation of the photoreceptors of the retina by light, the most common causes being pressure on an eyeball behind closed lids, a blow to the head resulting in pressure of the visual cortex against the inside of the skull (the effect often described as seeing stars), electrical stimulation of the visual cortex, or an aura (2) heralding an epileptic seizure (see EPILEPSY) or a migraine headache. Also called a photoma. \[From Greek phos light + phainein to show, from phaein to shine]
