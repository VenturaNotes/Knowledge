## Source [^1]
- (corticoid) n. any steroid hormone synthesized by the adrenal cortex. There are two main groups of corticosteroids. The glucocorticoids (e.g. cortisol, cortisone, and corticosterone) are essential for the utilization of carbohydrate, fat, and protein by the body and for a normal response to stress. Naturally occurring and synthetic glucocorticoids have very powerful anti-inflammatory effects and are used to treat conditions that involve inflammation. The mineralocorticoids (e.g. aldosterone) are necessary for the regulation of salt and water balance.
## Source[^2]
- Any of several steroid hormones produced by the cortex of the adrenal glands. Glucocorticoids regulate the use of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats in the body and include cortisol and cortisone. Mineralocorticoids regulate salt and water balance (see ALDOSTERONE).

- $n$. Any steroid hormone that is synthesized in and secreted by the adrenal cortex, including the glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids, or any of a group of synthetic drugs with a similar pharmacological action used to treat inflammatory or allergic conditions.
