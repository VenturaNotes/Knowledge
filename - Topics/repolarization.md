- The restoration of the resting potential in neurons or muscle fibres following the passage of a nerve impulse. Repolarization is brought about by diffusion of potassium ions out of the neuron and by active elimination of sodium ions ( see SODIUM PUMP).
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the process in which the membrane of a nerve cell returns to its normal electrically charged state after a nerve impulse has passed. During the passage of a nerve impulse a temporary change in the molecular structure of the membrane allows a surge of ions across the membrane (see ACTION POTENTIAL). During repolarization ions diffuse back to restore the charge and the nerve becomes ready to transmit further impulses. See REFRACTORY PERIOD.
