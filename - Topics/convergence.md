- (1) (in neurology) the formation of nerve tracts by fibres coming together into one pathway from different regions of the brain. 
- (2) (in ophthalmology) the ability of the eyes to turn inwards and focus on a near point so that a single image is formed on both retinas. The closer the object, the greater the degree of convergence.
## Source[^3]
- (1) (in neuroanatomy) The arrangement in which a single neuron receives inputs from numerous receptors or other neurons. For instance, in the retina of the eye, the output of over 100 million photoreceptors converge, via intermediate cells, on just 1 million ganglion cells, whose axons comprise the optic nerve. Consequently, convergence entails a funnelling of information from the input cells and integration of their signals into new output messages.
