- The minimum cost for a consumer of achieving a given utility level. Consider a consumer choosing the quantities, $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$, of two goods to minimize expenditure subject to a utility constraint. The cost minimization problem is$$\text{min}_{\{x_1,x_2\}} p_{1} x_{1}+p_{2} x_{2} \text { subject to } U\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right) \geq U.$$The solution is described by the two compensated demand functions $x_{1}=$ $h_{1}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, U\right)$ and $x_{2}=h_{2}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, U\right)$. Substituting the optimal choices back into the objective gives the minimized level of expenditure as$$E\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, U\right) \equiv p_{1} h_{1}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, U\right)+p_{2} h_{2}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, U\right).$$The function $E\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, U\right)$ is the expenditure function. Shephard's lemma states that $\partial E / \partial p_{i}=h_{i}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, U\right)$, a result that is useful for calculating the welfare consequences of a price change.
