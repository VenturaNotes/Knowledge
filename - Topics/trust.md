- (1) An arrangement enabling property to be held by a person or persons (the trustees) for the benefit of some other person or persons (the beneficiaries). The trustee is the legal owner of the property but the beneficiary has an equitable interest in it. A trust may be intentionally created or it may be imposed by law (e.g. if a trustee gives away trust property, the recipient will hold that property as constructive trustee for the beneficiary). Trusts are commonly used to provide for families and in commercial situations (e.g. pensions trusts). See also DISCRETIONARY TRUST; 18-25 TRUST; INTEREST-IN-POSSESSION TRUST; RELEVANT PROPERTY TRUST. 
- (2) In the USA, a form of monopoly in which the owners of merging corporations gave their stock to a board of trustees, who were empowered to act on their behalf. Such monopolies were largely outlawed by the antitrust laws.
