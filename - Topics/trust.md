- (1) An arrangement enabling property to be held by a person or persons (the trustees) for the benefit of some other person or persons (the beneficiaries). The trustee is the legal owner of the property but the beneficiary has an equitable interest in it. A trust may be intentionally created or it may be imposed by law (e.g. if a trustee gives away trust property, the recipient will hold that property as constructive trustee for the beneficiary). Trusts are commonly used to provide for families and in commercial situations (e.g. pensions trusts). See also DISCRETIONARY TRUST; 18-25 TRUST; INTEREST-IN-POSSESSION TRUST; RELEVANT PROPERTY TRUST. 
- (2) In the USA, a form of monopoly in which the owners of merging corporations gave their stock to a board of trustees, who were empowered to act on their behalf. Such monopolies were largely outlawed by the antitrust laws.

- (1) A situation in a game with asymmetric information where an agent is expected by other agent(s) to behave in a particular way or to perform a particular action. For example, when the quality of a product is known to the seller but not to the buyer, a buyer may expect, or trust, that the seller is offering a high-quality product. Equilibrium with trust may not exist in a static game, but can arise in a repeated game. An example is the equilibrium with trigger strategies in an infinitely repeated noncooperative game.
- (2) A fund established by an individual to create sustained benefits for another individual or entity. For example, a parent can establish a trust fund that makes payments to their children. A trust can hold a range of assets including cash, property, stocks, bonds, or any other type of financial instrument. A trust fund is managed by trustees who are responsible for ensuring that the resources held by the trust fund are used in the best interests of the recipient. See also INVESTMENT TRUST; UNIT TRUST.
- (3) A US term for a large or monopolistic business formed by amalgamation. This is why US anti-monopoly policy is called antitrust.
