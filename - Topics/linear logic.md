- A system of combinational and possibly sequential circuits in which the combinational component comprises exclusive-OR gates only. This is sometimes referred to as strongly linear logic in order to distinguish it from weakly linear logic in which inverters are permitted.
- In nonbinary ($q$-valued) systems, the EXOR gates are generalized to modulo- $q$ adders and subtractors.
