- A data file in which one or more secondary indexes are used (see INDEXED FILE). For each indexed field, the file is said to be inverted with respect to that field. If secondary indexes exist to all possible fields, the file is said to be fully inverted. Inversion results in a mapping from content to file locations, which supports the implementation of fast full-text searches.
