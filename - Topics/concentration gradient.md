- (diffusion gradient) The difference in concentration between a region of a solution or gas that has a high density of particles and a region that has a relatively lower density of particles. By random motion, particles will move from the area of high concentration towards the area of low concentration, by the process of diffusion, until the particles are evenly distributed in the solution or gas.
