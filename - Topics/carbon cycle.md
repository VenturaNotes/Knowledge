## Synthesis

- One of the major cycles of chemical elements in the environment (see BIOGEOCHEMICAL CYCLE). Carbon (as carbon dioxide) is taken up from the atmosphere, or from dissolved carbon compounds in water, and incorporated into the tissues of plants and other primary producers (e.g. phytoplankton) in photosynthesis. It may then pass into the bodies of animals as the primary producers are eaten (see FOOD CHAIN). During the respiration of plants, animals, and organisms that bring about decomposition, carbon dioxide is returned to the atmosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels (e.g. coal, natural gas, and peat) also releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. See illustration. See also GREENHOUSE EFFECT
