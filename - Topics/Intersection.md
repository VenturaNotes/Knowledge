## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
### Theorems
- $A \cap A = A$
## Source[^2]
- The probability of the intersection of two independent events
	- $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$

## Source[^3]
- Theorem: Multiplication Rule for Independent Events
	- Events A and B are independent if and only if $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$ where $A \cap B$ is the event where events A and B occur simultaneously
- Theorem: General Multiplication Rule
	- If A and B are dependent events, then $P(A \cap B) = P(B|A) \times P(A)$
