- $A \cap A = A$
## Source[^2]
- The probability of the intersection of two independent events
	- $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$

## Source[^3]
- Theorem: Multiplication Rule for Independent Events
	- Events A and B are independent if and only if $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \times P(B)$ where $A \cap B$ is the event where events A and B occur simultaneously
- Theorem: General Multiplication Rule
	- If A and B are dependent events, then $P(A \cap B) = P(B|A) \times P(A)$

- (1) of sets. The set that results from combining elements common to two sets $S$ and $T$, say, usually expressed as$$S \cap T$$$\cap$ is regarded as an operation on sets, the intersection operation, which is commutative and associative. Symbolically$$\begin{aligned}& S \cap T= \\& \{x \mid x \in S \text { and } x \in T\}\end{aligned}$$When two sets $S$ and $T$ intersect in the empty set, the sets are disjoint. Since the intersection operation is associative, it can be extended to deal with the intersection of several sets.
- (2) of two graphs, $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$. The graph that has as vertices those vertices common to $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ and as edges those edges common to $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$.
