- A market for a security, commodity, currency, etc. in which there are currently few transactions. In such a market the spread between bid and offer prices will be wide and any sizable transactions will have a direct effect on prices. Large investors tend to avoid a thin market because of its low liquidity. Compare DEEP MARKET.

- A market with few buyers and sellers. Thin markets typically exhibit high volatility in prices, low volume of transactions, and low liquidity of traded goods.
