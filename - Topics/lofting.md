- Constructing a number of longitudinal curves to blend a set of previously defined cross-sections in order to represent a surface (see BLEND). The term originates from the days of manual ship design: traditionally these curves were drawn full size; the drawings were too large to handle and lay out conveniently in the drawing office and were therefore stored and dealt with in large attics, called lofts.
