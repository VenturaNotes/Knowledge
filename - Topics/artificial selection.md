- The modification of species by selective breeding. Animals or plants with desirable characteristics are interbred with the aim of altering the genotype and producing a new strain of the organism for a specific purpose. For example, sheep are bred by means of artificial selection in order to improve wool quality. Traditional breeding techniques have been supplemented, and in many cases supplanted, by more recent methods of genetic engineering, genome editing, genetic testing, and embryo manipulation. Sequencing the genomes of commercially important animal and plant species has enabled the inheritance of desired genes to be monitored directly by molecular methods, instead of by phenotypic analysis. These methods have simultaneously opened up new approaches to selection and enabled it to become more refined and focused. See also DE-EXTINCTION.
