- A targeted ad (advertisement) is an advertisement that is designed to target a specific demographic of people. Targeted ads are chosen according to their relevance to a website's contents, assuming that the advertisements will also prove relevant to the website's users. There are various types of targeted advertising techniques—such as contextual advertising and even device advertising—which target people based on the websites they visit, or geotargeting which targets audiences based on their geographical location. Other forms of targeted advertising include social media targeting (targets users based on their behaviors on social media platforms) and retargeting (targets individuals by showing them ads based off of the websites they have previously visited).
