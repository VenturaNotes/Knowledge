- Crisis/incident management (C/IM) software helps businesses respond to emergencies and other issues. This program manages the activities of staff and other critical stakeholders in reaction to a crisis or incident, using a consistent and rapid approach to return to normal as soon as possible. An incident management solution might include developing and maintaining a crisis communications plan, collaborating with other enterprise security teams on a cohesive response, tracking activity and communicating about changes in the incident-handling process, managing costs through accounting software for small businesses, scheduling employees according to their availability, and gathering situational awareness about emergencies.
