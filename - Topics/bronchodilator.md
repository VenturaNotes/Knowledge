- $n$. an agent that causes widening of the air passages by relaxing bronchial smooth muscle. Sympathomimetic drugs that stimulate $\beta_{2}$ adrenoceptors, such as formoterol, salbutamol, and terbutaline, are potent bronchodilators and are used for relief of bronchial asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These drugs are often administered as aerosols, giving rapid relief, but at high doses they may stimulate the heart. Some antimuscarinic drugs (e.g. ipratropium and theophylline) are also used as bronchodilators.
