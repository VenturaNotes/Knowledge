- The area of mathematics generally taken to include those topics that involve the use of limit processes. Such limit processes apply to the definitions of continuity, derivatives, integrals, infinite series, Fourier series, and infinite products. Such ideas also apply to the complex numbers and complex-valued functions in complex analysis. Abstractions of these ideas lead to ideas of topological spaces, metric spaces, and measure spaces. Linear algebra focuses mainly on finite-dimensional vector spaces, and techniques of analysis are usually applied to the study of infinite-dimensional vector spaces (see BANACH SPACES, FUNCTION SPACES, HILBERT SPACES). Related areas such as differential equations and numerical analysis would also be considered part of applied analysis

- $n$. (1) (in psychology) any means of understanding complex mental processes or experiences. There are several systems of analysis used by different schools of psychology; for example, psychoanalysis; transactional analysis, in which people's relationships are explained in psychoanalytic terms; and functional analysis, in which a particular kind of behavior is thoroughly described with reference to its frequency, its antecedents, and its consequences. 
- (2) (in ethics) the process of assessing the different moral and medical justifications or arguments for particular approaches to a problem. These need to be weighed up in order to reach an appropriate conclusion.

- $n$. The action or process of analyzing; also, an abbreviated name for psychoanalysis.
