- (SSP; S2P) A scheme run by the UK government to provide a pension in addition to the basic state retirement pension. It was introduced in April 2002 to replace the existing State Earnings Related Pension Scheme (SERPS) and are discontinued for new claimants in 2016 Contributions were made through National Insurance payments. It was formerly possible to contract out of SSP by subscribing to an occupational pension scheme or a personal pension scheme; from 2012, however, it was only possible to contract out through a defined-benefit scheme operated by an employer.
