- $n$. the state or position of being accountable for one's actions and decisions. In health care, responsibility for some matters may be delegated to a less experienced clinician but overall responsibility remains with the senior. At the same time, responsibility for personal health is with the individual, an approach underlined by dependence agencies (such as Alcoholics Anonymous). Best health care in practice acknowledges this mutuality or partnership: the physician is an expert in medicine, the patient in him- or herself. See also PROFESSIONALISM.
