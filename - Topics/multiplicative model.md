- $n$. Any statistical or mathematical model in which an effect can be expressed as a weighted product of independent variables, so that if any of the independent variables is zero, then the value of the dependent variable is also zero, because any number multiplied by zero is zero. In axiomatic measurement theory, multiplicative models are divided into those that can be converted into additive models by means of monotonic transformations of their independent and dependent variables and those that cannot, only the latter being considered fundamentally nonadditive. Compare additive MODEL.
