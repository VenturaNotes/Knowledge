## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The fundamental unit of chromatin, the material of which eukaryotic chromosomes are made. It consists of a core of histone proteins around which are coiled about 160 base pairs of DNA. Consecutive nucleosomes, each 10 nm in diameter, are joined by uncoiled linker DNA, like beads on a string. This string is coiled into a 30 nm diameter solenoid, which undergoes further coiling in the fully condensed chromosome.
## Source[^2]
- A complex consisting of part of a DNA molecule wrapped around eight histone ‘cores’, the existence of which is the starting point of understanding DNA packing. Nucleosomes are the building blocks of chromatin. The structure of nucleosomes was established in the 1980s and 1990s using X-ray crystallography.
