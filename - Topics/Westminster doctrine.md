- In UK tax law, the principle that a person is entitled to make any lawful arrangement that he or she sees fit in order to reduce liability to tax. It is named after the ruling in the case Commissioners of Inland Revenue v the Duke of Westminster (1936), in which the House of Lords upheld the Duke's right to pay his gardener through a covenant scheme, thus reducing his liability to surtax. Compare RAMSEY PRINCIPLE. See also General Anti-Abuse Rule.
