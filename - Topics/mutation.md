- $n$. a change in the genetic material (DNA) of a cell, or the change this causes in a characteristic of the individual, which is not caused by normal genetic processes. In a point (or gene) mutation there is a change in a single gene; in a chromosome mutation there is a change in the structure or number of the chromosomes. All mutations are rare events and may occur spontaneously or be caused by external agents (mutagens). If a mutation occurs in developing sex cells (gametes) it may be inherited. Mutations in any other cells (somatic mutations) are not inherited.
