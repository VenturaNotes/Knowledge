- n. a genus of Gram-positive aerobic motile rodlike bacteria that are parasites of warm-blooded animals. The single species, L. monocytogenes, infects many domestic and wild animals.

In pregnant women it may cause a miscarriage or damage the fetus.

- A genus of rod-shaped aerobic motile Gram-positive bacteria. Only one species, $L$. monocytogenes, causes disease (listeriosis). It is resistant to physical and chemical treatments and can occur as a contaminant in certain foods, in faeces, etc. Listeriosis can take various forms, depending on the site of infection: localization in the central nervous system causes meningoencephalitis, while uterine infection can result in abortion or congenital handicap in the fetus.
