- n. a genus of Gram-positive aerobic motile rodlike bacteria that are parasites of warm-blooded animals. The single species, L. monocytogenes, infects many domestic and wild animals. If it is transmitted to humans, by eating infected animals or animal products, it may cause disease (listeriosis), especially in the frail, ranging from influenza-like symptoms to meningoencephalitis. In pregnant women it may cause a miscarriage or damage the fetus.
