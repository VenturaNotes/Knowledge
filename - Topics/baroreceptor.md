- (baroceptor) n. a collection of sensory nerve endings specialized to monitor changes in blood pressure. The main receptors lie in the carotid sinuses and the aortic arch; others are found in the walls of other large arteries and veins and some within the walls of the heart. Impulses from the receptors reach centers in the medulla; from here autonomic activity is directed so that the heart rate and resistance of the peripheral blood vessels can be adjusted appropriately.
## Source[^2]
- A receptor that responds to changes in pressure. Baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid sinus (in the carotid artery) respond to changes in arterial pressure and relay information via sensory nerves to the cardiac control center in the medulla oblongata. This regulates blood pressure and heartbeat via the parasympathetic nervous system.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any of the pressure-sensitive receptors in the right atrium of the heart and in certain large blood vessels that respond to decreases in blood volume or pressure, resulting from loss of extracellular fluid, by sending impulses to the hypothalamus, leading to the release of angiotensin II and a sensation of thirst. Also called a baroceptor. See also hypovolaemic thirst, subfornical organ. Compare blood-flow RECEPTOR. \[From Greek baros weight + English receptor]
