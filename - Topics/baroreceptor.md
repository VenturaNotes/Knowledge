- (baroceptor) n. a collection of sensory nerve endings specialized to monitor changes in blood pressure. The main receptors lie in the carotid sinuses and the aortic arch; others are found in the walls of other large arteries and veins and some within the walls of the heart. Impulses from the receptors reach centres in the medulla; from here autonomic activity is directed so that the heart rate and resistance of the peripheral blood vessels can be adjusted appropriately.
## Source[^2]
- A receptor that responds to changes in pressure. Baroreceptors in the aorta and carotid sinus (in the carotid artery) respond to changes in arterial pressure and relay information via sensory nerves to the cardiac control centre in the medulla oblongata. This regulates blood pressure and heartbeat via the parasympathetic nervous system.
