- For a country with a pegged exchange rate regime devaluation is an officially announced lowering in the value of the domestic currency relative to foreign currencies, usually as a means of correcting balance of payment deficit, at least temporarily. Devaluation and currency depreciation are similar: devaluation is used for a discrete change in the exchange rate brought about as a matter of policy, whereas depreciation occurs gradually through the working of the foreign exchange markets. Devaluation makes exports cheaper abroad in terms of foreign currency, and imports dearer at home in terms of home currency, and thus tends to improve the balance of trade but at the cost of increased import prices. See also COMPETITIVE DEVALUATION.

- A reduction in the value of a currency relative to gold or to other currencies. Governments engage in devaluation when they feel that their currency has become overvalued, for example through high rates of inflation making exports uncompetitive or because of a substantially adverse balance of trade. The intention is that devaluation will make exports cheaper and imports dearer, although the loss of confidence in an economy forced to devalue invariably has an adverse effect. Devaluation is a measure that need only concern governments with a fixed exchange rate for their currency. With a floating exchange rate, devaluation or revaluation takes place continuously and automatically (see DEPRECIATION; REVALUATION OF CURRENCY).
