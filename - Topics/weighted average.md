- (weighted mean) An arithmetic average that takes into account the importance of the items making up the average. For example, if a person buys a commodity on three occasions, 100 tonnes at $£ 70$ per tonne, 300 tonnes at $£ 80$ per tonne, and 50 tonnes at $£ 95$ per tonne, the purchases total 450 tonnes; the simple average price would be $(70+80+$ $95) / 3=£ 81.7$. The weighted average, taking into account the amount purchased on each occasion, would be $[(100 \times 70)+(300 \times 80)+(50 \times$ $95)] / 450=£ 79.4$ per tonne.
- In calculating the value of a share index, the share prices are usually weighted in some way, most often by the market capitalization of the company. An unweighted average is an average calculated on the basis of price only.
