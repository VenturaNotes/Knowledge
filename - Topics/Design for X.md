- Design for X—also called Design for Excellence, DfX, and DFX—is a design approach. The "X" in the term "design for X" stands for a specific objective that a business is trying to achieve. That could be manufacturing (design for manufacturing), service (design for service), quality (design for quality), or something else. The whole point of design for x is to review a particular design of a product or technology before a business achieves its specific objective. The review process involves laying out principles that specify a design and how designers will create and implement it; for example, coming up with best practices for a new product that will support a company's manufacturing objective, or determining the materials required to build a product that will deliver a company's service goals.
