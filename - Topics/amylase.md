## Source [^1]
- $n$. an enzyme that occurs in saliva and pancreatic juice and aids the digestion of starch, which it breaks down into glucose, maltose, and dextrins. Amylase will also hydrolyse glycogen to yield glucose, maltose, and dextrins.
## Source[^2]
- Any of a group of closely related enzymes that degrade starch, glycogen, and other polysaccharides. Plants contain both $\alpha$ - and $\beta$-amylases; the name diastase is given to the component of malt containing $\beta$-amylase, important in the brewing industry. Animals possess only $\alpha$-amylases, found in pancreatic juice (as pancreatic amylase) and also (in humans and some other species) in saliva (as salivary amylase or ptyalin). Amylases cleave the glycosidic bonds of the long polysaccharide chains, producing a mixture of glucose and maltose.
