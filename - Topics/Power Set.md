### Notation
- Pr(A)

### Definition
- $Pr(A) = \{S|S \subseteq A\}$

## Source[^2]
### Examples
- (1)
	- A = {1, 2,3}
	- P(A) = {$\varnothing$, {1}, {2}, {3}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {2, 3}, {1, 2, 3}}
	- The cardinality of a power set is $2^n$ where n equals the cardinality of the original set
		- So $2^3$ = 8 = |P(A)|
- (2)
	- A = {a}
	- P(A) = {$\varnothing$, {a}}

## Source[^3]
- (of a set $S$ ) The set of all subsets of $S$, typically denoted by $2^{S}$. It can be described as$$\{A \mid A \subseteq S\}$$The number of elements in the power set of $S$ is $2^{N}$, where $N$ is the number of elements in $S$.
