- An assignment statement of the form

  

$$

x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}:=t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}

$$

  

in which the value of the terms $t_{1}, \ldots, t_{n}$ over some $$ signature $\sum$ are evaluated and assigned in parallel as the new values of the variables $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}$. For example, the concurrent assignment

  

$$

x, y:=y, x

$$

  

simply swaps the values of $x$ and $y$.
