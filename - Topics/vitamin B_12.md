- (cyanocobalamin) a vitamin of the B complex. The form of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ with coenzyme activity is 5-deoxyadenosyl cobalamin, which is necessary for the synthesis of nucleic acids, the maintenance of myelin in the nervous system, and the proper functioning of folate, another B vitamin. The vitamin can be absorbed only in the presence of intrinsic factor, a protein secreted in the stomach. A deficiency of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ affects nearly all the body tissues, particularly those containing rapidly dividing cells. The most serious effects of a deficiency are pernicious anaemia and degeneration of the nervous system. Vitamin $B_{12}$ is manufactured only by certain microorganisms and is contained only in foods of animal origin. Good sources are liver, fish, and eggs. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is $1.5~ \mu \mathrm{g} /$day. Vegans can be at risk of deficiency.
