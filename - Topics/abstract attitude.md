- $n$. A term introduced by the German psychiatrist Kurt Goldstein (1878-1965) to denote the ability to use conceptual categories in order to classify things according to their attributes and to think symbolically rather than concretely. This ability is impaired in many forms of brain damage and mental disorder. Also called categorical attitude.
