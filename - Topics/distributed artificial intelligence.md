## Source [^1]
- An approach to artificial intelligence in which processing takes place not in a single algorithm but is distributed across a number of agents, possibly many. Each agent is autonomous, with its own actions and belief space, and the behavior of the whole system, which may or may not solve a particular problem, is characterized by its emergent properties.
