- $n$. The proposition that the conditional probability of an event $H$, given another event $D$, is equal to the joint probability of both events divided by the probability of the conditioning event: $P(H \mid D)=P(H$ and $D) / P(D)$. It follows immediately from the fourth of Kolmogorov's axioms of probability, and in spite of its apparent triviality it is important because Bayes' theorem is easily derived from it, eliminating the necessity to memorize Bayes' theorem. \[Named after the English mathematician and Presbyterian clergyman Thomas Bayes (1702-61) who introduced it]
