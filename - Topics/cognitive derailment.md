- $n$. A pattern of thinking, closely related to loosening of associations, in which ideas tend to slide from one track on to an unrelated or only indirectly related track. It is manifested in speech by idiosyncratic shifts between meaningful sentences or clauses, rather than within them. See also DISORGANIZED SPEECH, DISORGANIZED THINKING. Compare INCOHERENCE.
