- Net promoter score (NPS) is a proprietary market research metric It determines the chances of customers recommending a business, service, or product to a colleague based on their replies to a single query: if they would advocate the company to a friend. Based on their indication of how likely they would be to recommend this business, on a scale of 0 to 10, they are divided into "detractors" with ratings below 6, "passives" with ratings around 7 to 8, and "promoters" with ratings over 9. The whole number is obtained by deducting the detractors from the promoters to form the NPS.
