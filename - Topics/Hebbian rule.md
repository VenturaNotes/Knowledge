- $n$. In connectionism (1) and parallel distributed processing, a rule governing the alteration of weights of connections between units in order to adjust a network model in the direction of a target pattern of activation. For example, the Hopfield rule strengthens the connection between two units whenever both are simultaneously active or both are simultaneously inactive, and weakens the connection whenever one is active and the other inactive; the Stent-Singer rule strengthens the weight of a connection between two units whenever one is active and the other is capable of sending a signal to it and is also active, and it decreases the weight whenever the unit capable of sending the signal is inactive. \[Named after the Hebb synapse]
