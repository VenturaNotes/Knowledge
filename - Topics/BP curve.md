- A curve depicting balance of payments equilibrium in the ISLM model. The $B P$ curve is drawn on the same diagram as the $I S$ and $L M$ curves and shows combinations of $Y$ (gross domestic product) and $r$ (the interest rate) at which the overall balance of payments is in equilibrium. This means that the current and capital account balances of payments sum to zero. As higher $Y$ tends to produce a current account deficit, and higher $r$ tends to produce a capital account surplus, the $B P$ curve is upward sloping. If international capital mobility is high, the $B P$ curve is flatter than the $L M$ curve.
