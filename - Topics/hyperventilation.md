- $n$. breathing at an abnormally rapid rate at rest. This causes a reduction of the carbon dioxide concentration of arterial blood, leading to dizziness, tingling (paraesthesiae) in the lips and limbs, tetanic cramps in the hands, and tightness across the chest. If continued, hyperventilation may cause loss of consciousness. This sequence of events occurs in the hyperventilation syndrome (HVS), which has been estimated to contribute to $10 \%$ of out-patient referrals to hospital.
