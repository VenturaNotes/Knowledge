- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a collective name for all the processes that transform the latent content of a dream (1) into its manifest content, concealing its meaning from the dreamer and thus allowing undisturbed sleep to occur. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) identified the processes in his book The Interpretation of Dreams (1900, Standard Edition, IV-V) as condensation, displacement, secondary revision, and representability. See DREAM ANALYSIS. See also OVERDETERMINATION.
