- Produced in a small [[endocrine gland]] in the brain called the [[pineal gland]], as well as in the retina and a number of other organs and cells
- Melatonin produced in the pineal gland thought to contribute most to circulating levels of melatonin in the [[bloodstream]]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a hormone produced by the pineal gland in darkness but not in bright light. Melatonin receptors in the brain, in a nucleus immediately above the optic chiasm, react to this hormone and synchronize the nucleus to the 24-hour day/night rhythm, thus informing the brain when it is day and when it is night. Melatonin is a derivative of serotonin, with which it works to regulate the sleep cycle, and is being used experimentally to treat jet lag, SAD, and insomnia in shift workers and the elderly.
