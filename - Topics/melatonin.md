## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A derivative of [[serotonin]] best known for its role as a [[hormones|hormone]]. 
- Produced in a small [[endocrine gland]] in the brain called the [[pineal gland]], as well as in the retina and a number of other organs and cells
- Melatonin produced in the pineal gland thought to contribute most to circulating levels of melatonin in the [[bloodstream]]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a hormone produced by the pineal gland in darkness but not in bright light. Melatonin receptors in the brain, in a nucleus immediately above the optic chiasm, react to this hormone and synchronize the nucleus to the 24-hour day/night rhythm, thus informing the brain when it is day and when it is night. Melatonin is a derivative of serotonin, with which it works to regulate the sleep cycle, and is being used experimentally to treat jet lag, SAD, and insomnia in shift workers and the elderly.
## Source[^3]
- A hormone derived from serotonin and secreted by the pineal gland and retinas of vertebrates. Melatonin secretion by the pineal is linked to the dark-light cycle of the organism's environment, being greatest at night and lowest by day. Production is regulated by signals from the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus, which itself receives input from the retina (see biological Clock). The hormone is involved in regulating certain diurnal and seasonal changes in the body, such as the reproductive cycle in seasonally breeding animals. Melatonin also controls pigmentation changes; it triggers aggregation of the pigment melanin into melanophores in the skin, causing the skin to turn pale. It is used as a drug to treat sleep disorders and symptoms of jet lag.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. The hormone $N$-acetyl-5-methoxytryptamine secreted by the pineal gland only at night (hence sometimes called the Dracula hormone), lightening skin pigment in some organisms such as tadpoles, though apparently not in humans, affecting sexual development by inhibiting development of gonads in males and the oestrous cycle in females, perhaps promoting sleep (thus used for treating jet lag), and probably fulfilling other unknown functions. \[From Greek mela(s) black + English (sero)tonin, alluding to its ability to lighten melanocytes]
