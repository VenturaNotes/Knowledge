- $n$. A musical tone such as a difference tone or a summation tone that is heard in a complex tone but is not present in the sensations produced by the constituent components of the stimulus when they are presented singly. When there are two components, the lower having a frequency of $f_{1}$ and the higher a frequency of $f_{2}$, then the most easily audible combination tone is generally $2 f_{1}-f_{2}$, thus if tones with frequencies of 1,800 hertz and 2,000 hertz are presented, then a combination tone with frequency 1,600 hertz is heard, because $(2 \times 1,800)$ $-2,000=1,600$.
