- The description of an operation that is to be performed by a computer. It consists of a statement of an operation to be performed and some method of specifying the operands (or their locations) and the disposition of the result of the operation. Instructions are often divided into classes such as arithmetic instructions, program control instructions, logic instructions, and I/O instructions. They may or may not be of fixed length. The operation code or order code of an instruction specifies one of the set of operations available in a particular computer. See also INSTRUCTION FORMAT.

- An instruction is a term used by computer programmers to describe an order that is given to a computer processor by a computer program. Computer instructions are typically communicated using binary code, a sequence of 0s and 1s that describe the action a computer system is expected to perform. Computer instructions have three components: operation code, an address field, and a mode field. Operation code identifies a specific action to be performed. The address field displays where registers (special storage areas that contain data that can be used to carry out an instruction) and memory are located. The mode field shows how the register and memory will work together to perform an operation.
