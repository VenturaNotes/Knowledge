- Mobile robot systems that locomote by means of legs rather than wheels. This includes multilegged systems similar to insects with six or eight legs, systems with two legs (bipeds), and even one leg, as in the hopping machines developed at MIT. Such research produces results on dynamics, mobility, and active balance. See also MOBILE ROBOTICS
