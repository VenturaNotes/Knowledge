- Context-aware security is an IT term for making security decisions based on user and environment information. It includes factors such as identity verification, location-based data, and logins that help determine whether the system should trust a particular user. This approach to security may allow a user to access the internet from inside the office, for example, but prevent access if that same user attempts to access public Wi-Fi.
