## Source [^1]
- A relatively small hydrophobic molecule that facilitates the transport of ions across lipid membranes. Most ionophores are produced by microorganisms. There are two types of ionophore: channel formers, which combine to form a channel in the membrane through which ions can flow; and mobile ion carriers, which transport ions across a membrane by forming a complex with the ion. Examples of ionophores include vancomycin, nystatin, and 2,4-dinitrophenol.

- $n$. A chemical compound capable of combining with an ion and transporting it across a biological membrane. See also active transport, CARRIER PROTEIN. \[From ion + Greek -phoros carrying, from pherein to bear]
