- where clinical negligence is claimed, tests used to determine the standard of care owed by professionals to those whom they serve, e.g. the standards of care provided to patients by doctors. The 1957 case of Bolam v Friern Hospital Management Committee established that if a doctor acts in accordance with a responsible body of medical opinion, he or she will not be negligent. In 1997 this standard of care test was amended by the case of Bolitho v City and Hackney Health Authority, which requires the doctor's behavior to satisfy the judgment not only of responsible medical opinion but also of a court's own independent logical analysis.
