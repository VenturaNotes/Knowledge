- Trees that have the same structure or shape. More formally, two trees are similar if they both comprise exactly one node or, if not, the corresponding subtrees of the two roots are equal in number and are pairwise similar. For ordered trees, the pairwise correspondence is that given by the ordering imposed upon the subtrees of the two trees.
