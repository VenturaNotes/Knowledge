- Digitization is the process of converting real-world data into digital form. This transformation happens by scanning or capturing an image, recording a sound, or translating text into a digital format. Digitized data can be stored and processed using computers, allowing for easier sharing and access than if it were in analog form. Digitizing information helps preserve it because digital files are less susceptible to damage.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. (in radiology) the conversion of an analogue image to a digital image. The image is broken down to pixels and numerical values assigned to each pixel for its position and to describe its shade on the grey scale. This allows storage, electronic manipulation, and transfer via computer links of any images, including radiographs or CT, MRI, or ultrasound scans.
