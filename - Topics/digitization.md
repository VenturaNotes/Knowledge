## Source[^2]
- Digitization is the process of converting real-world data into digital form. This transformation happens by scanning or capturing an image, recording a sound, or translating text into a digital format. Digitized data can be stored and processed using computers, allowing for easier sharing and access than if it were in analog form. Digitizing information helps preserve it because digital files are less susceptible to damage.
