- (G7) The seven leading Western industrial nations: namely, the USA, Japan, Germany, France, UK, Italy, and Canada. This group evolved from the first economic summit held in 1976 and now holds an annual meeting attended by heads of state. The original aim was to discuss economic coordination but the agenda broadened to include political issues. From 1991 Russia attended G7 meetings, initially as an observer but from 1998 as a full participant (see Group of Eight). With the subsequent rise of China, India, and other non-Western economies the continuing role of the G7 and/or G8 has become a matter of some uncertainty. See Group of Twenty.
