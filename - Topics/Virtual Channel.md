- A virtual channel is a dedicated communications line that creates bandwidth. This bandwidth is needed to create virtual connections across a data network. They are typically only used in asynchronous transfer modes (ATM), as these channels are only necessary during that time. Virtual channels are used for switching when a network is using an ATM.
