### Description
- The leading entry in a row of a matrix is the first non-zero entry in that row, starting from the left. 
- However, if a row is all zeroes, then it doesn't have a leading entry
### Example
- $\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 2 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$
	- First row leading entry is 2 in position 1,2
		- #question Is there a reason there is no parentheses for 1, 2?
	- Second row has no leading entry
