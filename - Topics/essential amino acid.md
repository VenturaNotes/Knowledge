## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- an amino acid that is essential for normal growth and development but cannot be synthesized by the body. Essential amino acids are obtained from protein-rich foods in the diet, such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Adults require eight essential amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, threonine, methionine, tryptophan, and lysine. Children require an additional nine, as their body's requirement is greater than can be synthesised by it: tyrosine, glycine, cysteine, arginine, proline, histidine, glutamine, serine, and asparagine.
## Source[^2]
- An amino acid that an organism is unable to synthesize in sufficient quantities. It must therefore be present in the diet. In humans the essential (i.e. indispensable) amino acids are histidine, lysine, threonine, methionine, isoleucine, leucine, valine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan. These are required for protein synthesis and deficiency leads to retarded growth and other symptoms. Most of the amino acids required by humans are also essential for all other multicellular animals and for most protists.
