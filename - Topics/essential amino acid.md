## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- an amino acid that is essential for normal growth and development but cannot be synthesized by the body. Essential amino acids are obtained from protein-rich foods in the diet, such as meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Adults require eight essential amino acids: leucine, isoleucine, valine, phenylalanine, threonine, methionine, tryptophan, and lysine. Children require an additional nine, as their body's requirement is greater than can be synthesised by it: tyrosine, glycine, cysteine, arginine, proline, histidine, glutamine, serine, and asparagine.
