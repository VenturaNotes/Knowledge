- $n$. an examination of the uterus and Fallopian tubes using ultrasound rather than X-rays (as in hysterosalphingography). In saline infusion sonohysterography (SIS) evaluation of the endometrial cavity is augmented by the use of saline, which distends the uterine cavity separating the two layers of endometrium and creating a contrast. This can help identify intracavitary lesions (e.g. submucous fibroids) and determine the amount of cavity distortion.
