- The procedure to be adopted for forming a company in the UK. The subscribers to the company must send to the Registrar of Companies a statement giving details of the registered address of the new company together with the names and addresses of the first directors and secretary, with their written consent to act in these capacities. They must also give a declaration (declaration of compliance) that the provisions of the Companies Acts have been complied with and provide the memorandum of association and the articles of association. Provided all these documents are in order the Registrar will issue a certificate of incorporation and, in the case of a public company, a certificate enabling it to start business. In the case of a public limited company additional information is required.
- Measures designed to simplify the process of company formation were enacted in the Companies Act 2006 and came into force in late 2009.
