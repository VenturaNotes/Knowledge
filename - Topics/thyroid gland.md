- a large endocrine gland situated in the base of the neck (see illustration). It consists of two lobes, one on either side of the trachea, that are joined by an isthmus (sometimes a third lobe extends upwards from the isthmus). The thyroid gland consists of a large number of closed follicles inside which is a jelly-like colloid, which contains thyroglobulin and the principal active substances that are secreted by the gland. The thyroid gland is concerned with regulation of the metabolic rate by the secretion of thyroid hormone, which is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the pituitary gland and requires trace amounts of iodine. The $\mathrm{C}$ cells of the thyroid gland secrete calcitonin.

## Source[^2]
- A bilobed endocrine gland in vertebrates, situated in the base of the neck. It secretes two iodine-containing thyroid hormones, thyroxine ($\mathbf{T}_{4}$; see formula) and triiodothyronine $\left(\mathbf{T}_{3}\right)$, which are formed in the gland from thyroglobulin. They control the rate of many metabolic processes in the body, including energy metabolism, blood pressure, heart rate, muscle tone, and digestive function; they also influence physical development and activity of the nervous system. Growth and activity of the thyroid are controlled by thyroidstimulating hormone, secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. Adequate amounts of dietary iodine are required for the body to synthesize sufficient $\mathrm{T}_{3}$ and $\mathrm{T}_{4}$, and iodine deficiency causes enlargement of the thyroid (i.e. 'goitre'). The thyroid gland also contains $\mathbf{C}$ cells, which secrete calcitonin.
