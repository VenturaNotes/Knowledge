- Simultaneous causality between the dependent variable and an endogenous variable that is used as an explanatory variable. Endogeneity renders the ordinary least squares estimator biased and inconsistent; a consistent estimator can be obtained using regression with instrumental variables or by estimating a system of regression equations for all relevant endogenous variables. See also SIMULTANEOUS EQUATIONS MODEL; VECTOR AUTOREGRESSIVE (VAR) MODEL.
