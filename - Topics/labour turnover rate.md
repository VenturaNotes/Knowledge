- The ratio, usually expressed as a percentage, of the number of employees leaving an organization or industry in a stated period to the average number of employees working in that organization or industry during the period. An important distinction is made between uncontrollable turnover, as by death, superannuation, or unavoidable redundancy, and controllable turnover. A high rate of controllable voluntary turnover (i.e. by resignation) can be a sign of low job satisfaction in an organization; a high rate of controllable involuntary turnover (e.g. by dismissal for misconduct or poor performance or by retirement owing to work-related illness) is usually a sign that the organization has graver problems.
