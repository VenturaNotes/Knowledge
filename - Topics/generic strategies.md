- A framework for helping businesses to find the best means of gaining competitive advantage for their product, as set out by Michael Porter in 1980. The main strategies are the focus strategy, the low-cost strategy, and the differentiation strategy. Deciding between these generic approaches entails choices as to whether a business looks at the whole industry or one niche, and whether it competes on price or by distinguishing its product offer.
