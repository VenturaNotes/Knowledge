## Source [^1]
- In computer networks, nodes are
	- The computers that originates the data
	- The computers that routes the data
	- The computers that terminates the data

## Source[^2]
- (1) A point in a computer network where communication lines, such as telephone lines, electric cables, or optical fibers, are interconnected. The device used to make the connection(s) may be a simple electric interface-as used in a local area network. In more complex longer-distance networks a computer is required.
- Node computers vary in their functional capabilities but their basic use is to switch incoming information to the necessary output line so that the information ultimately reaches its specified destination. The information may be transmitted as a whole or may be split into segments (see MESSAGE SWITCHING, PACKET SWITCHING). When the information reaches its final destination, the node computer at this point will send it through to the recipient(s).
- Nodes can also be called stations, and in many X25 networks the switching nodes are known as exchanges. 
- (2) A substructure of a hierarchical data structure that cannot be further decomposed, e.g. a vertex in a graph or tree.
