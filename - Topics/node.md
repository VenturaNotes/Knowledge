## Source [^1]
- In computer networks, nodes are
	- The computers that originates the data
	- The computers that routes the data
	- The computers that terminates the data
## Source[^2]
- (1) A point in a computer network where communication lines, such as telephone lines, electric cables, or optical fibers, are interconnected. The device used to make the connection(s) may be a simple electric interface-as used in a local area network. In more complex longer-distance networks a computer is required.
- Node computers vary in their functional capabilities but their basic use is to switch incoming information to the necessary output line so that the information ultimately reaches its specified destination. The information may be transmitted as a whole or may be split into segments (see MESSAGE SWITCHING, PACKET SWITCHING). When the information reaches its final destination, the node computer at this point will send it through to the recipient(s).
- Nodes can also be called stations, and in many X25 networks the switching nodes are known as exchanges. 
- (2) A substructure of a hierarchical data structure that cannot be further decomposed, e.g. a vertex in a graph or tree.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. a small swelling or knot of tissue. See ATRIOVENTRICULAR NODE; LYMPH NODE; SINOATRIAL NODE.
## Source[^4]
- (1) (in botany) The part of a plant stem from which one or more leaves arise. The nodes at the stem apex are very close together and remain so in species of monocotyledons that form bulbs. In older regions of the stem they are separated by areas of stem called internodes. 
- (2) (in anatomy) A natural thickening, bulge, or distinct mass of tissue in an organ or part of the body. Examples are the sinoatrial node that controls the heartbeat (see pACEMAKER) and the lymph nodes. 
- (3) (in phylogenetics) (vertex) A branch point in a phylogram.
## Source[^5]
- n. 
- (1) Any natural anatomical swelling or bulge. 
- (2) Any point in a network model or graph where lines or pathways intersect or branch, especially (in cognitive psychology) an element representing a concept in a semantic network of relations between nodes (relations such as $x$ is $a$ member of $y$ or $x$ is an attribute of $y$), each node being linked to certain other nodes in the network. See also ACT, CLOSED NODE, FAN EFFECT, OPEN NODE. \[From Latin nodus a knot]
