- mental confusion or delirium occurring in combination with paralysis of the eye muscles, nystagmus, and an unsteady gait. It is caused by a deficiency of vitamin $B_{1}$ (thiamine) and is most commonly seen in alcoholics and in patients with persistent vomiting or an unbalanced diet. Treatment with thiamine relieves the symptoms. \[K. Wernicke (1848-1905), German neurologist]
