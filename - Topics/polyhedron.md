## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A three-dimensional solid bounded by polygons, with straight edges and sharp vertices. There are many polyhedral molecules. Chemists have been interested in the challenge of synthesizing molecules in the shape of particular polyhedra (see platonic hydrocarbons) and in determining the number of polyhedra associated with a specific number of vertices when considering large coordination numbers.
