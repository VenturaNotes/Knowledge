## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The tendency for two different genes on the same chromosome to remain together during the separation of homologous chromosomes at meiosis. Linkage can be broken by crossing over or by a chromosome mutation , when sections of chromosomes are exchanged and new combinations of genes are produced. See also HAPLOTYPE; SEX LINKAGE.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. (in genetics) the situation in which two or more genes lie close to each other on a chromosome and are therefore very likely to be inherited together. The further two genes are apart the more likely they are to be separated by crossing over during meiosis.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. In genetics, the occurrence of two genes close together on the same chromosome, so that they are unlikely to become separated during crossing over and tend to be inherited together. See also GENE MAPPING, INDEPENDENT ASSORTMENT.
