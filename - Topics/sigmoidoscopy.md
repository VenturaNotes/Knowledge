- $n$. an examination of the rectum and sigmoid colon with a device (sigmoidoscope) inserted through the anus. Sigmoidoscopy can be used to identify the causes of diarrhoea and rectal bleeding, such as colitis or cancer. There are two main types of sigmoidoscopy. Rigid sigmoidoscopy utilizes a rigid sigmoidoscope, approximately 30 cm in length, to assess for anorectal disease. It can be readily performed in an outpatient clinic. The second type is flexible sigmoidoscopy, which is more commonly used and utilizes a flexible endoscope to assess the rectum, sigmoid colon, and descending colon up to the splenic flexure.
