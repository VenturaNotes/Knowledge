- adj. having the property of absorbing, and therefore being opaque to, X-rays. Radiopacity increases with atomic weight. Radiopaque materials, such as those containing iodine or barium, are used as contrast media in radiography. Metallic foreign bodies in tissues are also radiopaque and can be detected by radiography. Such heavy elements as lead and barium can be used in shielding to protect people from unnecessary exposure to ionizing radiation. $\textemdash$radiopacity $n$.
