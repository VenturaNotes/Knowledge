- (minimal-access surgery) surgical intervention involving the least possible physical trauma to the patient, particularly surgery performed using an operating laparoscope or other endoscope (see LAPAROSCOPY) passed through tiny incisions; it is known popularly as keyhole surgery. Several types of abdominal surgery, including gall bladder removal (see CHOLECYSTECTOMY) and extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy for stones in the urinary or bile drainage system, are commonly performed in this way. Such methods are usually more comfortable and allow the patient to resume normal activity much sooner than would be possible after more conventional procedures. See also INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY.
