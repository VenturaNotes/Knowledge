- (SIV) An arbitrage fund that raises finance by selling asset-backed commercial paper (CP) and medium-term notes and invests predominantly in asset-backed securities (ABSs). The SIV makes its profit from the difference between the short-term rate paid to the holders of CP and the longer-term rate earned on the ABSs. By late 2008 all known SIVs had failed as a result of the global financial crisis.

- (SIV) An investment company spun off from a bank or a similar financial institution, intended to profit by borrowing money cheaply and then buying securities such as mortgage-backed bonds, and more complex instruments such as collateralized debt obligations, that pay higher rates of interest. SIVs became a problem during the credit crunch in 2007, when the value of the securities in SIVs dropped.
