## Source [^1]
- (parathormone) a hormone, synthesized and released by the parathyroid glands, that controls the distribution of calcium and phosphate in the body. A high level of the hormone causes transfer of calcium from the bones to the blood; a deficiency lowers blood calcium levels, causing tetany. This condition may be treated by injections of calcium gluconate. Compare CALCITONIN.
- Recombinant parathyroid hormone (Preotact) is given by subcutaneous injection to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis.
## Source[^2]
- (PTH; parathormone; parathyrin) A peptide hormone secreted by the parathyroid gland in response to low levels of calcium in the blood. It acts to maintain normal blood levels of calcium by (1) increasing the number of osteoclasts, which break down the bone matrix and release calcium into the blood; (2) increasing the reabsorption of calcium and magnesium ions in the kidney tubules, so that their concentration is maintained in the blood; (3) converting vitamin D to its active form, which increases calcium absorption in the intestine. Parathyroid hormone acts in opposition to calcitonin.
