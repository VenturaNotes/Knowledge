- (parathormone) a hormone, synthesized and released by the parathyroid glands, that controls the distribution of calcium and phosphate in the body. A high level of the hormone causes transfer of calcium from the bones to the blood; a deficiency lowers blood calcium levels, causing tetany. This condition may be treated by injections of calcium gluconate. Compare CALCITONIN.
- Recombinant parathyroid hormone (Preotact) is given by subcutaneous injection to treat postmenopausal osteoporosis.
