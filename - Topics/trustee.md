- A person who holds the legal title to property but who is not its beneficial owner. Usually there are two or more trustees of a trust and for some trusts of land this is necessary. The trustee may not profit from the position but must act for the benefit of the beneficiary, who may be regarded as the real owner of the property. Either an individual or a company may act as trustee. It is usual to provide for the remuneration of trustees in the trust deed, otherwise there is no right to payment. Trustees may be personally liable to beneficiaries for loss of trust property.

- An individual or company who is the legal owner of property which he or she administers on behalf of a beneficiary. The beneficiary in turn may be an individual, a charity, the creditors of a bankrupt, or the investors in a unit trust. Trustees may be paid for their services, but are bound to administer the trust in the interests of the beneficiaries and not for their own profit.
