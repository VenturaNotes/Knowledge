- (2) A tax or customs duty payable on imports or exports, or a list detailing such duties. HM Revenue and Customs issues tariffs stating which goods attract duty and what the rate of duty is. 
- (3) A list of charges in which the charging rate changes after a fixed amount has been purchased or in which a flat fee is imposed in addition to a quantity-related charge, as in two-part tariffs for gas or telephone services.

- A scale of charges. In economics a tariff was originally a schedule of taxes on imports; it now refers to the actual import duties. An ad valorem tariff is set as a percentage of the price of the goods imported. A specific tariff is set in money terms per physical unit of the good imported, and does not depend on its price. A non-discriminatory tariff taxes imports from all countries equally; tariff preferences mean that similar imports from different countries are taxed at different rates. See also OPTIMUM TARIFF; PROHIBITIVE TARIFF; REVENUE TARIFF; TWO-PART TARIFF.
