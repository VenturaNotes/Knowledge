- Coins made of gold ceased to circulate after World War I. At one time it was illegal to hold more than four post-1837 gold coins and there have been various restrictions on dealing in and exporting gold coins at various times. Since 1979 (Exchange Control, Gold Coins Exemption, Order) gold coins may be imported and exported without restriction, except that gold coins more than 50 years old with a value in excess of $Â£ 8,000$ cannot be exported without authorization from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills. See also Britannia Coins; KrugerRand.
