- $n$. 
- (1) the injection of a volume of blood obtained from a healthy person (the donor) into the circulation of a patient (the recipient) whose blood is deficient in quantity or quality, through accident or disease. Direct transfusion from one person to another is rarely performed; usually packs of carefully stored blood of different blood groups are kept in blood banks for use as necessary. Before a blood transfusion the recipient's blood type is tested so that only blood that is compatible will be transfused to reduce potentially life-threatening transfusion reactions. During transfusion the blood is allowed to drip, under gravity, through a needle inserted into one of the recipient's veins. Blood transfusion is routine during major surgical operations in which much blood is likely to be lost. 
- (2) the administration of any fluid, such as plasma or saline solution, into a patient's vein by means of a drip. See also AUTOTRANSFUSION.
