- An agreement made in 1962 by the Group of Ten countries to extend international credit. The agreement is a misnomer, as the countries actually agreed to lend via the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to enable each other to borrow extra reserves if this was necessary to defend their currencies. The agreement was later extended to other members of the IMF.
