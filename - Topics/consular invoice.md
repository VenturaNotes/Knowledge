- An export invoice that has been certified in the exporting country by the consul of the importing country. This form of invoice is required by the customs of certain countries (especially South American countries) to enable them to charge the correct import duties. A certificate of origin may also be required. The fee charged by the consul for this or any other commercial service is called the consulage.
