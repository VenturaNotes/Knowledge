- Bluetooth itself refers to the communication method that allows for two devices to talk to each other without wires. Bluetooth 4.0 is a specific version of Bluetooth. It uses three specific functions: Classic Bluetooth, Bluetooth High Speed (HS) and Bluetooth Low Energy (LE). Its enhanced connectivity and low-energy protocol marked the most significant upgrades from the prior version. It has since been outclassed by subsequent versions, with the most modern one available now being BT5.3.
