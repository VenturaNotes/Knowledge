A research technique, very similar to the time sampling diary, and virtually synonymous with time sampling, introduced by the Italian-born US psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (born 1934) and two co-authors in an article in the Journal of Youth and Adolescence in 1977, where they originally called it the 'experiential sampling method'.
