- $n$. any one of a family of proteins that form the protein components of lipoproteins, which transport hydrophobic lipid molecules in the plasma. Individual members of the family are designated by the abbreviation 'Apo' followed by a capital letter. Apolipoproteins have a range of molecular weights and perform a variety of functions during the life cycle of the lipoproteins in which they are found. These include acting as ligands for the binding of enzymes (ApoB) and as cofactors for the action of other enzymes (ApoA and ApoC).
