- $n$. the production of heat in a part of the body by means of a high-frequency electric current passed between two electrodes. Diathermy is utilized to coagulate tissues and seal off blood vessels, thus effecting haemostasis. In bipolar diathermy electric current passes between the two electrodes of the instrument. In monopolar diathermy the instrument is one electrode, the other being a large pad applied to another part of the patient's body. Examples of instruments used to deliver diathermy include diathermy knives, forceps, and scissors. Diathermy snares and needles can be used to destroy unwanted tissue and to remove small superficial neoplasms. See also ELECTROSURGERY.
