- $n$. the presence of bacteria in the urine $\left(10^{5} / \mathrm{ml}\right)$ with or without symptoms of urinary tract infection (e.g. burning or frequent urination). Asymptomatic bacteriuria is more common in women (especially during pregnancy), the elderly, and in patients with diabetes, bladder catheters, and spinal cord injuries. Unless treated with antibiotics, patients are at higher risk of kidney infections (pyelonephritis).
