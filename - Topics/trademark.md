- A distinctive symbol that identifies particular products of a trader to the general public. The symbol may consist of a device, words, or a combination of these. A trader may register a trademark at the Register of Trade Marks, which is at the Intellectual Property Office. This authorizes the trader to enjoy the exclusive right to the trademark in connection with the products for which it was registered. Any manufacturer, dealer, importer, or retailer may register a trademark. Registration is initially for ten years and is then renewable. The right to remain on the register may be lost if the trademark is not used or is misused. The owner of a trademark may assign it or, subject to the Registrar's approval, allow others to use it. If anyone uses a registered trademark without the owner's permission, or uses a mark that is likely to be confused with a registered trademark, the owner can sue for an injunction and damages or an account of profits.
- A trademark is a form of intellectual property and as such is an intangible asset. Since 1996 it has been possible to obtain Community Trade Marks for the whole of the EU.
