- (SME) According to the definition by the European Commission, an enterprise qualifies as an SME if it meets the criterion on the employee headcount (between 50 and 249 for medium-sized, between 10 and 49 for small, and between 1 and 9 for micro), and one of two other criteria: a turnover of no more than 50,10 , or 2 million euros, or a balance sheet of no more than 43,10 , or 2 million euros, for medium-sized, small, or micro, respectively. SMEs represent 99 per cent of all enterprises in the EU and enjoy favorable tax treatment and other advantages under the EU and national legislation of the EU member countries. Similar classifications for the purpose of preferential treatment exist in many countries outside the EU. For example, in the United States, the Small Business Administration defines the size standards, separately for different industries, to determine which enterprises are eligible for its programmes.
