- (germinoma, gonocytoma) $n$. a malignant tumour of the ovary, thought to arise from primitive germ cells; it is homologous to the seminoma of the testis. About $15 \%$ of such tumours affect both ovaries; outside the ovary they have been recorded in the anterior mediastinum and in the pineal gland. Dysgerminomas may occur from infancy to old age, but the average age of patients is about 20 years. Treatment is by oophorectomy, with chemotherapy for residual disease.
