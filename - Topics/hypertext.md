- A generic term covering a number of techniques used to create and view multidimensional documents, which may be entered at many points and which may be browsed in any order by interactively choosing words or key phrases as search parameters for the next text image to be viewed (see HOT LINK). Generally a wimp style interface is used and tools are provided to help structure the text, create indexes of the text of a document, and to cross-reference between documents. The technique is related to full-text database systems. Hypertext systems provide facilities for windowing viewed text, selecting next view by mouse/keyboard marking of text fragments, searching the text database or indexes, and displaying the new text. See also HYPERMEDIA.

- A document format used in multimedia and on the Internet in which a page of text contains links, usually in the form of highlighted words or icons (see HTML). Selecting one of these hyperlinks takes the user directly to related documents, enabling them to pursue a line of investigation without having to search for each item individually. Links could be to further documents directly relating to the initial search subject, to related subjects, or even to further specialist sources. The connections can therefore increase exponentially.
