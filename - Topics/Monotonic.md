- The word monotonic means "always moving in the same direction", in our case, always going up.

## Source[^2]
- (1) Assuming that appropriate ordering relations exist on the domain $A$ and the codomain $B$ of the function $f: A \rightarrow B$, then $f$ is said to be monotonic if for all $a$ in $A$ and $b$ in $B$ for which $a \leq b$ then $f(a) \leq f(b)$.
