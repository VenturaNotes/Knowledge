- $n$. the evolution of an invasive cancer cell from a normal cell. This is a multistep process characterized by successive genetic mutations caused by carcinogens. Intermediate stages, sometimes called premalignant, preinvasive, or noninvasive, may be recognizable, but the interchangeable use of these terms can be confusing, and they have been replaced by carcinoma in situ.
