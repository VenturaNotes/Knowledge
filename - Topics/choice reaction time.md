- $n$. Reaction time in a situation in which there are two or more possible stimuli requiring different responses. The usual measure involves a home button surrounded by eight other buttons, arranged in a semicircle around it, each accompanied by a small light. The person being tested places a finger or a stylus on the home button and then attempts to move it as quickly as possible to press whichever of the other buttons is lit up on each trial. It is negatively correlated with psychometric measures of intelligence. Also called complex reaction time or compound reaction time .
