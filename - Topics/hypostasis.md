Hypostatic congestion of the lung bases may be seen in debilitated patients who are confined to bed. It predisposes to pneumonia (hypostatic pneumonia) but it may be prevented by careful nursing and physiotherapy. A similar condition (lividity) occurs after death when blood pools in the dependent parts of the body after the circulation has ceased. $\textemdash$hypostatic adj.
