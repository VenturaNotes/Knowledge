## Synthesis

- A type of clocked flip-flop consisting of master and slave elements that are clocked on complementary transitions of the clock signal. Data is only transferred from the master to the slave, and hence to the output, after the master-device outputs have stabilized. This eliminates the possibility of ambiguous outputs, which can occur in single-element flip-flops as a result of propagation delays of the individual logic gates driving the flip-flops.
