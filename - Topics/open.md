- To instruct an application that a particular file is required for reading, writing, or both. When a file is opened, its name is passed to the operating system, which locates it and checks that it exists and is available—creating it if necessary—before giving to the application status information and the location of the first record. Once a file has been opened for writing it is normally unavailable to other applications until it has been closed (but see RECORD LOCKING).
