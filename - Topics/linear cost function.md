- Cost behavior that, when plotted on a graph against activity levels, results in a straight line. For example, total fixed cost levels and variable costs per unit of activity will both result in a straight line horizontal to the $x$-axis when activity, production, or sales is plotted on the $x$ axis. Total variable costs will also result in a straight line and is thus a linear cost function.
