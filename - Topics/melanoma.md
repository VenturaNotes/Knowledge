- (malignant melanoma) $n$. a highly malignant tumor of melanin-forming cells, the melanocytes. Such tumors usually occur in the skin (pale skin, genetic predisposition, and excessive exposure to sunlight, particularly repeated sunburn, are the most important factors); it may arise from a pre-existing mole or naevus or from apparently normal skin. It can rarely occur at other sites than the skin. Melanomas are usually dark, but may also be free of pigment (amelanotic melanomas). Spread of this cancer to other parts of the body, especially to the lymph nodes and liver, is common if the original melanoma is thick. The prognosis is inversely related to the thickness of the tumor; almost all patients with tumors less than 0.76 mm survive following surgical excision. The mainstay of treatment is surgery, but melanoma can be responsive to immunotherapy and is currently the subject of investigational treatments using melanoma vaccines; the response rate to conventional chemotherapy is poor. Primary prevention programmes reducing episodes of sunburn are advanced in some parts of the world, such as Australia.
