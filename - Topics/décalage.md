- $n$. A term introduced by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980) for the non-simultaneous attainment of different but closely related operational abilities. Horizontal décalage is the non-simultaneous attainment of different aspects of a cognitive operation during the same developmental stage, as when conservation of volume is preceded by conservation of mass, which in turn is preceded by conservation of number and substance, all of these attainments occurring during the stage of concrete operations; vertical décalage refers to changes that occur as a child progresses from one developmental stage to another; and oblique décalage refers to refinements of abilities at one developmental stage that prepare the way for attainments at a later stage. \[From French décalage a gap or lag, from décaler to bring forward]
