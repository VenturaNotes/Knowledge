- (1) a courtesy title given to a qualified medical practitioner, i.e. one who has been registered by the General Medical Council (GMC). Most doctors in the UK obtain bachelors' degrees in medicine and surgery (MB, BS) or the diplomas of the conjoint boards of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons of England and Scotland or the Society of Apothecaries (e.g. LRCP, MRCS, LMSSA): these degrees or diplomas are required by the GMC before a person is provisionally registered as a doctor. Normally it is also necessary to undertake training under the medical Foundation Programme in a hospital recognized for this purpose. Such a doctor has the title foundation doctor and is debarred from independent practice. Thereafter doctors undertake further training to be eligible for full registration on the GMC's specialist or GP registers (see Appendix 9). Surgeons in the UK do not use the title Doctor and are referred to, as a mark of distinction, as Mr, Mrs, or Ms. Qualified dentists also use the courtesy title Doctor. See also consultant. 
- (2) the title given to a recipient of a higher university degree than a Master's degree (this is usually a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD or DPhil) degree). The degree Medicinae Doctor (MD) is awarded by some British universities as a research degree to those with a first degree in medicine. In the US, the degree is awarded on qualification.
