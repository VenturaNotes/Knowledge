- A region of cerebral cortex in the vertebrate brain situated immediately anterior and lateral to (in front of and to either side) the primary motor cortex. It integrates sensory information and controls the movements of muscles close to the body's vertical axis. The supplementary motor area lies between the premotor cortices. It is involved in planning complex movements, especially ones involving the hands.
