Their production is controlled by gonadotrophin-releasing hormone. The main gonadotrophins are follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.

- (gonadotrophic hormone) Any of several hormones, secreted by the mammalian anterior pituitary gland, that stimulate reproductive activity of the testes or ovaries (the gonads). Pituitary gonadotrophins include follicle-stimulating hormone and luteinizing hormone.

The presence of large amounts of human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG) in the urine of women is an indication of pregnancy.
