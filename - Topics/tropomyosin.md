- A protein found in the actin filaments in muscles. The molecule consists of two elongated strands that run along the length of the filament. When the muscle is at rest, the tropomyosin molecule covers the binding site of the actin molecule, where interaction with myosin occurs. On contraction of the muscle, the tropomyosin is displaced by another protein, troponin, allowing the interaction of actin with myosin. See sliding filament THEORY.
