- A membrane protein that effects the active transport of a substance across a cell membrane while transporting ions in the opposite direction. An antiporter is a type of cotransporter; the ions, typically hydrogen ions $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$or sodium ions $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$, flow down their concentration gradient, and in so doing provide the energy for the transport of another substance in the other direction. For example, heart-muscle cells have a $\mathrm{Na}^{+} / \mathrm{Ca}^{+}$antiporter, which is driven by the inward flow of sodium ions to pump calcium ions $\left(\mathrm{Ca}^{+}\right)$out of the cell. Hence, the energy for antiporters derives ultimately from the energy-consuming mechanisms that establish the concentration gradient of the driving ions. Compare SYMPORTER; UNIPORTER.
