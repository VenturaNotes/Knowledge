- (foundation hospitals) self-governing NHS organizations established under the Health and Social Care Act 2003. Foundation trusts were intended to be accountable to their local communities and NHS Improvement rather than to central government, while remaining subject to inspection by the Care Quality Commission in the same way as other health-care providers. In recent years, however, many foundation trusts have required additional government funding due to financial deficits, with the result that central government has regained a large degree of financial and planning control. In practice, few differences now remain between foundation trusts and other NHS acute trusts.
