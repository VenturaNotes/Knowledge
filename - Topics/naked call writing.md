- Selling (writing) a call option on assets that one does not own. A person may do this if he or she expects the price of a particular asset to fall or remain unchanged. It is, however, a dangerous strategy because if the price rises the assets will have to be purchased at the market price in order to deliver them, thus involving an unlimited risk.
