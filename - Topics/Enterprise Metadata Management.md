- Enterprise metadata management is the process of managing metadata, enabling businesses to understand their data assets. Metadata consists of large quantities of information such as a document's author, the date it was last opened, and the file size. Depending on the size of a dataset or a business, metadata can make up millions—or even billions—of pieces of data. Managing this data is complex, so companies often opt to use EMM software to regulate, monitor, sort and analyze this data.
