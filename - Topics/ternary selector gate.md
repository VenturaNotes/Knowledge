- (T-gate) A combinational ternary logic gate that is important as a building block in the synthesis of ternary logic circuits (see MULTIVALUED LOGIC). A Tgate has four inputs

  

$$

\left\{a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}, s\right\}

$$

  

and one output $\{t\}$, all of which can take values represented by elements of the set $\{0,1,2\}$. The function of the T-gate is given by $t=a_{s}$. It thus acts as a ternary selector, the choice from

  

$$

\left\{a_{0}, a_{1}, a_{2}\right\}

$$

  

being selected by the value taken by the $s$ input.
