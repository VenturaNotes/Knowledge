- a measure of bone mineral density used to evaluate the degree of bone thinning detected on DEXA scanning. An individual's T score is the number of standard deviations above or below the mean reference value for young healthy adults. By convention, a score above -1 is considered normal, a score between -1 and -2.5 indicates osteopenia, and a score below -2.5 indicates osteoporosis.
