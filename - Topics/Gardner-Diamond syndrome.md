- (painful bruising syndrome, psychogenic purpura) a rare disorder, characterized by unexplained, recurrent, and painful bruising, typically arising after physical and/or psycho-emotional stress. Classically, ecchymoses spontaneously appear and are associated with a prodrome of warmth and pain at the sites. The condition, which is seen primarily in young to middle-aged women, is induced by trauma and associated with personality disorders. Research into the syndrome is sparse but recent publications suggest that only a minority of patients experience a serious reduction in their quality of life, that the condition seems to be dermal rather than systematic in most patients, and that it seems to be associated with ongoing stress. \[L.
