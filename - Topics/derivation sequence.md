- In formal language theory, a sequence of words of the form

  

$$

w_{1} \Rightarrow w_{2} \Rightarrow \ldots \Rightarrow w_{n}

$$

  

(for notation see semi-Thue system). For a context-free grammar, such a sequence is leftmost (or rightmost) if,

for each $1 \leq i \leq n$,

$w_{i+1}$ is obtained from $w_{i}$ by rewriting the leftmost (or rightmost) nonterminal in $w_{i}$. Such sequences exist for all derivable words.
