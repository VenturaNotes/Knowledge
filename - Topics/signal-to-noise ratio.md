- The ratio of the signal power to the noise power in a physical transmission channel; it is often measured in decibels (dB). The definition is best applied to statistically well-behaved noise such as white Gaussian noise. A more useful definition, frequently employed when small signals are needed, is signal-plus-noise to noise ratio. This has the benefit of being easy to measure. With large signals and low-noise circuits the two definitions are virtually identical. See also CHANNEL CODING THEOREM.
