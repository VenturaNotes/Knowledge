- $n$. a procedure in which an artificial opening is made through the anterior abdominal wall into the stomach to allow direct access for feeding or gastric decompression. A gastrostomy is performed when swallowing is considered unsafe or impossible, due either to neurological disease (such as stroke, multiple sclerosis, or motor neuron disease) or to obstruction by a tumour. It is often used temporarily after operations on the oesophagus or head and neck area until healing has occurred. Formerly a gastrostomy was always performed surgically, but it can now be done using an endoscope (percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, PEG) or by direct puncture under radiological guidance (radiologically inserted gastrostomy, RIG).
