- Corporate performance management (CPM) is an umbrella term that describes the methodologies, metrics, processes, and systems used to monitor and manage the business performance of an enterprise. CPM must be supported by a suite of analytical applications that provide the functionality to support these processes. A CPM suite's three main application components include budgeting, planning, and forecasting. They involve short-term financially focused budgets, longer-term plans, and high-level strategic plans.
