- (initiation codon) The triplet of nucleotides on a messenger RNA molecule (see CODON) at which the process of translation is initiated. In eukaryotes the start codon is AUG (see GENETIC CODE), which codes for the amino acid methionine; in bacteria the start codon can be either AUG, coding for N-formyl methionine, or GUG, coding for valine. Compare STOP CODON.
