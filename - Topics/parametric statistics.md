- $n$. A branch of statistics that makes assumptions about the parameters of the distributions from which the data are drawn, often including the assumption that variables conform to the normal distribution. It deals mainly with data measured on interval or ratio scales that are suitable for the application of ordinary arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication, so that parameters such as the mean and standard deviation can be meaningfully defined. Compare DISTRIBUTION-FREE TEST, NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICS.
