- The Johari Window is a technique typically used in the workplace that helps people understand their relationships with themselves and others. It can uncover conscious and unconscious biases within an organization and increase self-awareness among employees. American psychologists Joseph Luft and Harrington Ingham created the Johari Window in 1955. It consists of four quadrants that map personality awareness, resulting in four areas of understanding:Â 
	- (1) Open self (when a person is willing to share information about themselves with others)
	- (2) Blind self (when a person doesn't know something about themselves that others are aware of)
	- (3) Hidden self (when a person knows something about themselves but are not willing to share that information with others)
	- (4) Unknown self (something that a person doesn't know about themselves and others are also unaware of)
