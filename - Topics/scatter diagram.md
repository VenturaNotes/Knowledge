- A graph on which observations are plotted on the $y$-axis for events on the $x$-axis. For example, the wages incurred ($y$-axis) for each level of activity ($x$-axis) would produce a scatter graph from which a relationship can be established between the two variables, as an aid to predicting cost behavior.
## Source[^2]
- A diagram depicting the relation between two characteristics of a set of observations. Each point marked on the diagram shows an observation of the two characteristics, for example age and the income of an individual, measured on the two axes. This is often helpful in suggesting whether there is a likelihood of finding any significant statistical relation between the two characteristics, and what type of function it is worth trying to fit. It also draws attention to any outlying observations which may merit special investigation.
