- Class of service is a highly technical term. It refers to the types of data that are being sent in a packet of data. Conversely, within a transmission, this term refers to the priorities of data, or access to different levels of service. This service can include extended voicemail or the ability to send longer text messages, as well as data and voice services, meaning that it can impact a variety of data and voice protocols.
