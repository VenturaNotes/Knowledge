- In Fortran, an area of storage accessible from more than one program unit (subroutine). Data is local to the subroutine in which it is defined unless it is declared to be in a COMMON area. There is one anonymous COMMON area, called ‘blank COMMON’, and any number of other areas, which are named (‘labelled COMMON’).
