- A contract providing that price will equal measured costs plus an agreed percentage mark-up for profit. This procedure is criticized because it gives the producer no incentive to keep down costs; rather, the incentive is to increase costs needlessly, thereby increasing the profit margin also. Cost-plus pricing is often used in government contracts, for example in military spending, where the customer wants the product urgently and there is great uncertainty about costs. Under these circumstances a cost-plus contract may give a lower expected price than a fixed-price contract, because any fixed price agreed would include a substantial risk premium for the producer.

- An approach to establishing the selling price of a product or service in a commercial organization, in which the total cost of the product or service is estimated and a percentage mark-up is added in order to obtain a profitable selling price. A variation to this approach is to estimate the costs to a particular stage, say the costs of production only, and then to add a percentage mark-up to cover both the other overheads (including administration, selling, and distribution costs) and the profit margin. This approach to costing is very different from target costing. Compare FULL COST PRICING; MARGINAL COST PRICING.
