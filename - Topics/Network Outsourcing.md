- Network outsourcing is the type of contract in which a business or entity will use a third party to manage its digital networking. This can involve numerous functions, including maintenance, expansion, and general consulting services. As the name implies, it can occur on two levels: Enterprise or Public Network. Enterprise network outsourcing has more limited functions. It does not include items like physical repair. Public network outsourcing has a broader array of services, including working with a carrier network or managing support systems.
