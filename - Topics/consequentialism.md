- $n$. a variety of ethical theories arguing that the morality of an action, rule, or way of life can be determined by its outcome or consequences, rather than by its intrinsic nature or the motives or character of those performing or following it. The best known example of consequentialism is utilitarianism, which in general seeks to achieve maximum utility or good outcomes for the greatest possible number of people in society.
- In medical ethics, the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence can be seen as consequentialist in their concern with outcomes but also as deontological in that they are regarded as duties. A cost-benefit analysis or risk-benefit analysis on utilitarian principles is often carried out when distributing medical resources or deciding between treatments. A calculation of this kind also forms the basis of the quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) system (see QUALITY OF LIFE).
- A major objection to consequentialism is that the consequences of actions cannot always be predicted or perceived. Questions also arise regarding the likelihood of the consequences, whom they will affect (individuals, populations, animals, the environment), and by whom and what means they should be evaluated. $\textemdash$consequentialist adj.
