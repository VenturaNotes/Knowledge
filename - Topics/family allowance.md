- A UK welfare benefit paid to the parents or guardians of dependent children from 1946 to 1977. The name was changed to child benefit in 1977. The arguments for a family allowance are the desire to avoid child poverty and considerations of horizontal equity, as people with families have more demands on their incomes than childless people with the same income. Child benefit in the UK was a universal benefit until 2013, which resulted in it being poorly targeted; it is now withdrawn if a family has at least one high-income earner. In contrast, the US equivalent, Temporary Assistance to Needy Families, is time-limited, and recipients are required to find work within 24 months of starting to receive the benefit.
