- $n$. one of a group of naturally occurring polypeptides that are powerful vasodilators, which lower blood pressure, and cause contraction of smooth muscle. The kinins bradykinin and kallidin are formed in the blood by the action of proteolytic enzymes (kallikreins) on certain plasma globulins (kininogens). Kinins are not normally present in the blood, but are formed under certain conditions; for example when tissue is damaged or when there are changes in the pH and temperature of the blood. They are thought to play a role in inflammatory response.

- (1) One of a group of peptides, occurring in blood, that are involved in inflammation and regulating blood pressure. Kinins are formed in response to blood-vessel injury by the splitting of blood plasma globulins (kininogens) by the enzyme kallikrein at the site of inflammation. Kinins include bradykinin and kallidin. They cause local increases in the permeability of small blood vessels and are also potent vasodilators that act to reduce blood pressure. Other roles have been identified in cell proliferation and migration, and in oedema formation. They mediate their effects by binding to two classes of G-protein-coupled receptors, $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ and $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ receptors. Bradykinin is a potent stimulator of pain in the skin.

## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any of a group of polypeptides functioning as local hormones, manufactured in the blood or tissues as and when needed, causing smooth muscles to contract and blood vessels to dilate. Two important kinins found in human and animal tissue are cholecystokinin and bradykinin. \[From Greek kineein to move + -in(e) indicating an organic compound]
