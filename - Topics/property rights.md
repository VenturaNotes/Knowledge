- The rights of an owner over property. These generally include rights to use property, and to exclude others from it. Property rights are not absolute: the use of assets may be subject to legal controls, such as the need for planning permission for changes in the use of land and buildings. The law also restricts the methods owners may use to exclude others from their property: for example, in the UK dwellings can only be reoccupied by their lawful owners through the courts and not by force. The existence of property rights is a basic requirement for organized economic activity to take place. If it is not clear who owns property, and what their rights over it are, there is a disincentive to acquire property and resources will be wasted defending from theft property that is accumulated. See also INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.
