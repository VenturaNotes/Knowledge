- A legal defence in which a senior executive claims to have been ignorant of fraudulent or otherwise unlawful practices within their company. The term was coined by the prosecutor in the 2005 trial of Bernie Ebbers, the founder of WorldCom, who was found guilty of an $11 billion fraud. The failure of his defence meant that similar claims became less likely in subsequent trials.
