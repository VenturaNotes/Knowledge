- Salts or esters of carbamic acid, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{NCOOH}$, or their derivatives. They include various insecticides, such as aldicarb, methiocarb, and propoxur. These are active against a wide range of insects upon contact or ingestion; they work by inhibiting cholinesterase enzymes, which are essential for nervous system function. Hence carbamates are also toxic to other animals, including humans. However, their persistence in the environment is relatively low.
