## Source [^1]
- a form of tinnitus that has a rhythmical quality. It may be synchronous with the heartbeat, in which case a vascular origin is likely. Pulsatile tinnitus that is not synchronous with the heartbeat may have a muscular origin due to middle ear muscle myoclonus or palatal myoclonus. Pulsatile tinnitus may be audible to an observer, in which case it is classified as objective pulsatile tinnitus. More often it is inaudible to others and is classified as subjective pulsatile tinnitus.
