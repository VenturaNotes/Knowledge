### Converting Binary to Decimal
- If you have the binary number $111_2$, assign a power of 2 to each bit, starting from $2^0$ for the rightmost bit, $2^1$ for the next, and so on
	- So ones place is = $2^0 \times 1$ = 1
	- The tens place is $2^1\times1$ = 2
	- The hundreds place is $2^2 \times 1$ = 4
- So the solution is $7_{10}$ 
## Source [^1]
- Binary is a system used by digital computers to encode data and programs
## Source[^2]
- A number system that uses two distinct symbols (the digits 0 and 1) to represent a number. Also called base-2.
## Source[^3]
- Binary is a numeric system made up of two digits: 0 and 1. Computer systems operate using the binary code, storing data and performing calculations using only zeros and ones. In this system, 1 refers to “on” or “true,” whereas 0 refers to “off” or “false.” Computers use this binary code to instruct electrical signals to turn on and off inside the central processing unit (CPU) or random-access memory (RAM). The binary system is also known as the base-2 system.
