- Binary is a numeric system made up of two digits: 0 and 1. Computer systems operate using the binary code, storing data and performing calculations using only zeros and ones. In this system, 1 refers to “on” or “true,” whereas 0 refers to “off” or “false.” Computers use this binary code to instruct electrical signals to turn on and off inside the central processing unit (CPU) or random-access memory (RAM). The binary system is also known as the base-2 system.
