- Voice of the Customer (VoC) solutions are various technologies that capture, store, and analyze customer feedback. These technologies monitor customer experiences, preferences, behaviors, and expectations. Therefore, they are a valuable tool for market research. VoC solutions include enterprise-feedback-management software, social-media monitoring tools, text-mining tools, speech analytics, and web analytics. When users combine one or more of these tools, they can generate a holistic view of the customer's voice. Marketers can then use customer insights generated from these tools to target customers on different channels.
