- (1) The term most generally used to refer (in some way) to a location within the computer memory; the word location is actually used as a synonym. Such reference is usually made for the purpose of retrieving or storing some information at that location. The reference may be explicit (see DIRECT ADDRESSING) or it may be made in any of a number of ways for convenience or brevity (see ADDRESSING SCHEMES). In some architectures the registers in the CPU and/or the I/O devices are also addressed.
- The word address is also used as a verb: to specify a location. 
- (2) In communications, see ADDRESSING.
