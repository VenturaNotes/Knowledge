- (RMI) a scoring system that combines ultrasound findings, menopausal status and age, and serum CA125 levels to give an estimate of the risk of malignancy in a woman with a mass in the Fallopian tubes or ovaries. If the total RMI score is $<200$ the risk of malignancy is considered to be low. If the total RMI score is $>200$ the chances of malignancy are raised and management should be planned with a gynaecological oncologist.
