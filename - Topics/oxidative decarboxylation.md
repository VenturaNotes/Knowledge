## Source [^1]
- The reaction in the Krebs cycle in which oxygen, derived from two water molecules, is used to oxidize two carbon atoms to two molecules of carbon dioxide. The two carbon atoms result from the decarboxylation reactions that occur during the Krebs cycle as the six-carbon compound citrate is converted to the four-carbon compound oxaloacetate.
