- The Japanese concept of continuous improvement that underlies both total quality management and just-in-time techniques. Its prime consideration is to ensure that problems are continuously sought out and rectified and that opportunities for improvement, in any aspect of the system, are exploited. Rather than concealing problems, staff are encouraged to bring them to the surface and to suggest solutions; a degree of employee empowerment is therefore required. The aim of this approach is to prevent the large-scale change that may be required if a system is allowed to stagnate and then has to be brought back into line.
