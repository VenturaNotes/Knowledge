- Social network analysis (SNA) looks at the patterns and relationships within particular groups of people. SNA is not limited to social media networks but also focuses on interpersonal and professional workplace relationships. It can even refer to assessing how people work together in teams within an organization. This type of analysis examines how individuals influence each other within these groups, and the data gathered can be used to assess the effectiveness of teamwork, communication, and productivity and make effective organization-wide changes.
