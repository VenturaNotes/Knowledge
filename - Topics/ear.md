- $n$. the sense organ concerned with hearing and balance (see illustration). Sound waves, transmitted from the outside into the external auditory meatus, cause the eardrum (tympanic membrane) to vibrate. The small bones (ossicles) of the middle ear - the malleus, incus, and stapes - transmit the sound vibrations to the fenestra ovalis, which leads to the inner ear (see LABYRINTH). Inside the cochlea the sound vibrations are converted into nerve impulses. Vibrations emerging from the cochlea could cause pressure to build up inside the ear, but this is released through the Eustachian tube. The semicircular canals, saccule, and utricle - also in the inner ear - are all concerned with balance.

## Source[^3]
- The sense organ in vertebrates that is specialized for the detection of sound and the maintenance of balance. It can be divided into the outer ear and middle ear, which collect and transmit sound waves, and the inner ear, which contains the organs of balance and (except in fish) hearing (see illustration). The term ear is often used for the pinna of the mammalian outer ear.

- $n$. The organ of hearing and equilibrium, which in vertebrates is usually divided into the sound-collecting outer ear separated by a tympanic membrane from the sound-transmitting middle ear, separated in turn by a round window and an oval window from the inner ear in which are situated the vestibular system and its semicircular canals containing sensory receptors that govern sensations of balance, orientation, and acceleration, and the cochlea with its auditory organ of Corti (see illustration).
