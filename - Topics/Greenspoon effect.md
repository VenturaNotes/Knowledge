- $n$. Modification of the content of conversational speech, without the speaker's awareness, through reinforcement given by the listener in the form of nods, smiles, or expressions of approval such as 'mmm-hmm'. Such reinforcers have been used to increase the speaker's use of a certain word, or a category of words such as plural nouns, or the frequency with which the speaker expresses personal opinions, and so on. \[Named after the US psychologist Joel Greenspoon (1921-2004) who reported the effect in articles in the American Psychologist in 1954 and the American Journal of Psychology in 1955, although previous studies had already demonstrated the effect]
