- The function whose value is zero for every element in its domain. The term is usually applied more specifically to the function$$\begin{aligned}& Z: N \rightarrow N \\& \text {for which } Z(n)=0\end{aligned}$$for all $n$ in $N$, the set of nonnegative integers. This function is basic to the theory of recursive and primitive recursive functions.
