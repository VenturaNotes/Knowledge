- A sigma algebra or $\sigma\text{-}\text{algebra}$, X, of a set S is a family of subsets which contains the empty set, the set itself, the complement of any set in X, and all countable unions of sets in X. The measurable sets in a measure space form a sigma algebra, as do the set of events in a probability space.
