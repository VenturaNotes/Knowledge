- A surface defined as a function of two parameters. For example, the successive positions and shapes of a deformable curve $\mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}(u)$ moving in $3=$ space generate a surface where each point is characterized by the time $v$ at which the moving curve passes through it and the value of the parameter $u$, which characterizes the point on the moving curve.
