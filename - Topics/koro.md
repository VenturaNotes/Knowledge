- $n$. a state of acute anxiety, seen especially in certain cultures (such as that of the Chinese of SE Asia), characterized by a sudden belief that the penis is shrinking into the abdomen and will disappear: the sufferer is often convinced that disappearance of the penis means death. Occasionally women have a similar belief that their breasts are disappearing into their body. It is usually treated with tranquillizing drugs and reassurance.
## Source[^2]
- n. A culture-bound syndrome included in CCMD-2 (the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders, 2nd ed.), restricted mainly to male members of ethnic Chinese communities in southern and eastern Asia and elsewhere, sometimes occurring in localized epidemics (1), characterized by sudden and intense anxiety that the penis is shrinking and is liable to retract into the abdomen, resulting in death. In an effort to prevent this from happening, afflicted men often hold on to their penises during the day and wear commercially available bamboo clamps while sleeping. A less common female variant of the syndrome, focused on fear of the nipples or vulva retracting, is also recognized. Also called shook yong, shuk yang, suk yeong, or suo yang in Chinese-speaking areas, rok-joo in Thailand, and jinjinia bemar or jinjin in north-eastern India. \[From Malay koro to shrink]
