- $n$. a prostaglandin drug $\left(\mathrm{PGE}_{1}\right)$ administered to improve lung blood flow in newborn babies with congenital heart defects who are awaiting surgery; it acts by preventing the closure of the blood vessel connecting the aorta to the pulmonary artery (see DUCTUS ARTERIOSUS). Possible side-effects include diminished respiratory efforts. Alprostadil is also administered to treat erectile dysfunction in men; it acts by relaxing smooth muscle and dilating the cavernosal arteries, so that blood is trapped when the venules become compressed against the tunica albuginea.
