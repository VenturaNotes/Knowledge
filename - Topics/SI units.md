- The system of units of measurement adopted internationally for scientific and technical use under the Système International d'Unités. There are seven fundamental units-the meter, second, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, candela, and mole-of seven dimensionally independent physical quantities. Other units are derived algebraically from these base units without the use of numerical factors, or are dimensionless (like the radian). The symbols for all units are standardized, as are the prefixes (and their symbols) that represent decimal multiples (e.g. nano-, micro-, milli-, kilo-, mega-, giga-) of the units.

- Système International d'Unités: an international metric system of units used in science and increasingly for commercial purposes. It is based on the seven basic units: metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, candela, and mole. Derived units with special names include the hertz (frequency), joule (energy), volt (potential), and watt (power). They are used with a standard set of multiples and sub-multiples, including hecto- ( $\times 100$ ), kilo$(\times 1000)$, centi- $(\times 1 / 100)$, and milli- $(\times 1 / 1000)$.
## Source[^3]
- (Système International d'Unités) the internationally agreed system of units now in use for all scientific purposes. Based on the metre-kilogram-second system, SI units have seven base units and two supplementary units. Measurements of all other physical quantities are expressed in derived units, consisting of two or more base units. Tables 1.1 and 1.2 (Appendix 1) list the base units and the derived units having special names; all these units are defined in the dictionary.
- Decimal multiples of SI units are expressed using specified prefixes; where possible a prefix representing 10 raised to a power that is a multiple of three should be used. Prefixes are listed in Table 1.3 (Appendix 1).
## Source[^4]
- Système International d'Unités: the international system of units now recommended for all scientific purposes. A coherent and rationalized system of units derived from the m.k.s. units (a metric system based on the metre, kilogram, and second), SI units have superseded c.g.s. units and Imperial units. The system has seven base units and two dimensionless units (formerly called supplementary units), all other units being derived from these nine units. There are 22 derived units with special names. Each unit has an agreed symbol (a capital letter or an initial capital letter if it is named after a scientist, otherwise the symbol consists of one or two lower-case letters). Decimal multiples of the units are indicated by a set of prefixes; when possible a prefix representing 10 raised to a power that is a multiple of three should be used. See Appendix 1.
