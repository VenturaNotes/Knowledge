## Source [^1]
- The system of units of measurement adopted internationally for scientific and technical use under the Système International d'Unités. There are seven fundamental units-the metre, second, kilogram, ampere, kelvin, candela, and mole-of seven dimensionally independent physical quantities. Other units are derived algebraically from these base units without the use of numerical factors, or are dimensionless (like the radian). The symbols for all units are standardized, as are the prefixes (and their symbols) that represent decimal multiples (e.g. nano-, micro-, milli-, kilo-, mega-, giga-) of the units.
