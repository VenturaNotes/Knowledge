## Source [^1]
- Often considered an area of applied mathematics, operational research encompasses the application of various analytical methods such as stochastic modeling, simulation, optimization, or decision analysis to resolve complex decision-making scenarios.
## Source[^2]
- (operations research) A scientific method of approaching industrial and commercial problems in order to arrive at the most efficient and economic method of achieving the desired objective. It basically consists of making a clear statement of the problem, designing a model to represent the possible solutions using different strategies, and applying the solutions obtained from the analysis of the model to the real problem. It makes use of game theory, critical-path analysis, simulation techniques, etc.

## Source[^3]
- The application of mathematical and statistical methods to the practical problems facing businesses. The techniques used include linear programming, critical path analysis, and queuing and inventory analysis. These have been applied to problems including finance, purchasing, production, marketing, delivery systems, and inventory control.
