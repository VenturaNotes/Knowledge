- (trembling disease) n. a disease that involves a progressive degeneration of the nerve cells of the central nervous system, particularly in the region of the brain that controls movement. Muscular control becomes defective and shiver-like tremors occur in the trunk, limbs, and head. Death usually occurs within 9-12 months. Thought to be caused by a prion and transmitted by cannibalism, kuru was largely limited to the Fore tribe of New Guinea and mainly affected women and children, reaching high levels in the mid-20th century. It has died out since cannibalism is no longer practised. See also SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY.
