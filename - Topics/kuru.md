- (trembling disease) n. a disease that involves a progressive degeneration of the nerve cells of the central nervous system, particularly in the region of the brain that controls movement. Muscular control becomes defective and shiver-like tremors occur in the trunk, limbs, and head. Death usually occurs within 9-12 months. Thought to be caused by a prion and transmitted by cannibalism, kuru was largely limited to the Fore tribe of New Guinea and mainly affected women and children, reaching high levels in the mid-20th century. It has died out since cannibalism is no longer practised. See also SPONGIFORM ENCEPHALOPATHY.

- $n$. A human prion disease affecting the nervous system, restricted to the Fore highlanders of Papua New Guinea who used to practise a form of ritual cannibalism involving the eating of the brains of deceased relatives as an act of homage. It is characterized by tremor, ataxia, dementia, and death usually within months of the onset of symptoms. \[Native Fore word: literally, the trembles]
