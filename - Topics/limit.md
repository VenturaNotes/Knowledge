- (1) The maximum fluctuations (up or down) allowed in certain markets over a stated period (usually one day's trading; see INTRADAY LIMIT). In some volatile circumstances the market moves the limit up (or down). The movement of prices on the Tokyo Stock Exchange is limited in this way as it is on certain US commodity markets. In some markets, if the limit is reached trading is stopped for the day or for a cooling-off period. 
- (2) A restriction on a derivatives or commodity exchange on the number of contracts or positions one party can hold.
