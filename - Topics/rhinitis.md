- $n$. inflammation of the mucous membrane of the nose. It may be caused by virus infection (acute rhinitis; see COLD) or an allergic reaction (allergic rhinitis; see HAY FEVER). In atrophic rhinitis the mucous membrane becomes thinned and fragile. In perennial (or vasomotor) rhinitis there is overgrowth of, and increased secretion by, the membrane.
