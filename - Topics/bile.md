- $n$. a thick alkaline fluid that is secreted by the liver and stored in the gall bladder, from which it is ejected intermittently into the duodenum via the common bile duct. Bile may be yellow, green, or brown, according to the proportions of the bile pigments (excretory products) present; other constituents are lecithin, cholesterol, and bile salts. The bile salts help to emulsify fats in the duodenum so that they can be more easily digested by pancreatic lipase into fatty acids and glycerol. Bile salts also form compounds with fatty acids, which can then be transported into the lacteals. Bile also helps to stimulate peristalsis in the duodenum.
