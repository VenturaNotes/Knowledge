- $n$. a thick alkaline fluid that is secreted by the liver and stored in the gall bladder, from which it is ejected intermittently into the duodenum via the common bile duct. Bile may be yellow, green, or brown, according to the proportions of the bile pigments (excretory products) present; other constituents are lecithin, cholesterol, and bile salts. The bile salts help to emulsify fats in the duodenum so that they can be more easily digested by pancreatic lipase into fatty acids and glycerol. Bile salts also form compounds with fatty acids, which can then be transported into the lacteals. Bile also helps to stimulate peristalsis in the duodenum.
## Source[^2]
- (gall) A bitter-tasting greenish-yellow alkaline fluid produced by the liver, stored in the gall bladder, and secreted into the duodenum of vertebrates. It assists the digestion and absorption of fats by the action of bile salts, which decrease the surface tension of fat droplets so that they are emulsified, hence increasing their surface area exposed to the action of lipase enzymes. It may also stimulate gut muscle contraction (peristalsis). Bile contains the bile pigments, bilirubin and biliverdin, which are produced by the breakdown of the blood pigment haemoglobin and subsequently eliminated in faeces.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A viscous bitter greenish or golden brown alkaline fluid secreted by the liver, stored in the gall bladder, and discharged into the duodenum during digestion for the emulsification and absorption of fats. See also humour (3). \[From Latin bilis bile]
