- IT consulting is the practice of helping an SMB align its technology and business strategies. IT consultants provide organizations with the following advisory services:
	- Evaluate necessary IT requirements
	- Digitize operations
	- Invest in new software and hardware
	- Assess value from existing technologies
- IT consulting might involve architecture planning, which defines how an organization will use new and existing technologies to achieve its business goals and meet customer requirements. Another IT consulting method called operational assessment (or benchmarking) determines the operating capacity and efficiency of an organization's IT architecture. IT consultants might also use implementation planning to advise an SMB about the rollout, testing and deployment of IT solutions.
