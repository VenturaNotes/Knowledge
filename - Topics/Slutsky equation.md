- Slutsky equation The equation showing how the effect on demand for a good of a change in a price can be decomposed into a substitution effect, which is the effect of a change in relative prices at an unchanged level of utility, and an income effect, which is the effect of a change in real income holding prices constant. Denote the demand for good $i$ by $x_{i}$, the price of good $j$ by $p_{j}$, income by $M$, and utility by $U$. The Slutsky equation is$$\frac{\partial x_{i}}{\partial p_{j}}=\frac{\partial x_{i}}{\partial p_{j}} |_{U}-x_{j} \frac{\partial x_{i}}{\partial M}$$where $\frac{\partial x_{i}}{\partial p_{j}}|_{U}$ is the substitution effect and $-x_{j} \frac{\partial x_{i}}{\partial M}$ the income effect.
