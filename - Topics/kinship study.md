- $n$. In behavior genetics, a comparison of the correlations between relatives of different known degrees of genetic relatedness on a measurable trait in order to estimate the heritability of that trait, the assumption being that the higher the heritability of the trait the more closely will the correlations correspond to degrees of relatedness. For example, because children share on average half their genes with each parent and with each sibling, the highest correlation between such relatives that could be expected for a trait with very high heritability is .5 , and a substantially lower correlation would suggest low heritability, but see emergenesis. Also called a consanguinity study or a family study. Compare adoption STUDY, TWIN STUDY.
