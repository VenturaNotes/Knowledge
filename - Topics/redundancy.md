## Synthesis

- The provision of additional components in a system, over and above the minimum set of components needed to perform the functions of the system, for purposes of reliability or robustness. For example, with triple modular redundancy three components are deployed in parallel, all performing the same function. Their outputs are compared, and when one component produces a different result from the other two, this item is assumed to be faulty and is ignored. Redundancy covers not only the incorporation of duplicate or triplicate hardware for backup in case of failure, but also the inclusion of excess symbols in messages sent through communication systems in order to combat the effects of noise (see ERROR-CORRECTING CODE, ERROR-DETECTING CODE).

- In a business setting, redundancy occurs when employers dismiss employees because a specific position in their workforce is no longer deemed necessary. For example, if a company buys a machine that can automatically perform the duties of an employee, that employee ªs job would be deemed redundant.
- In the tech industry, the term redundancy is used to describe the duplication of a computer component such as computer data or a computerized device to prevent it from becoming unavailable in the future. In other words, redundancy is a system design that duplicates a computer component so that if it fails, there is a reliable backup. However, redundancy can be used in a negative manner when referring to duplicating a computer component unnecessarily or due to poor planning.
