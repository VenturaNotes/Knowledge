## Synthesis

- The provision of additional components in a system, over and above the minimum set of components needed to perform the functions of the system, for purposes of reliability or robustness. For example, with triple modular redundancy three components are deployed in parallel, all performing the same function. Their outputs are compared, and when one component produces a different result from the other two, this item is assumed to be faulty and is ignored. Redundancy covers not only the incorporation of duplicate or triplicate hardware for backup in case of failure, but also the inclusion of excess symbols in messages sent through communication systems in order to combat the effects of noise (see ERROR-CORRECTING CODE, ERROR-DETECTING CODE).

- In a business setting, redundancy occurs when employers dismiss employees because a specific position in their workforce is no longer deemed necessary. For example, if a company buys a machine that can automatically perform the duties of an employee, that employee ªs job would be deemed redundant.
- In the tech industry, the term redundancy is used to describe the duplication of a computer component such as computer data or a computerized device to prevent it from becoming unavailable in the future. In other words, redundancy is a system design that duplicates a computer component so that if it fails, there is a reliable backup. However, redundancy can be used in a negative manner when referring to duplicating a computer component unnecessarily or due to poor planning.

- (1) The loss of a job by an employee because the job has ceased to exist or because there is no longer work available. It involves dismissal by the employer, with or without notice, for any reason other than a breach of the contract of employment by the employee, provided that no reasonable alternative employment has been offered by the same employer. In the UK, if the employee has been continuously employed in the business for at least two years, a redundancy payment must be made by the employer according to the Employment Rights Act 1996, the amount of which will depend on the employee's age, length of service, and rate of pay.

- Termination of employment without any fault on the part of the employees concerned, because of a fall in the employer's need for labour. Some UK workers have a legal right to compensation for redundancy. Employers may make redundancy payments in excess of legal requirements to induce workers to accept offers of voluntary redundancy and so avoid the need for compulsory redundancies.
