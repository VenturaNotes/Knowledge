- A measurable variable that gives information regarding performance or prospects. Examples of macroeconomic indicators are price, money supply, income, imports, and exports. Most organizations will use a range of financial and other indicators to assess the performance of individuals, departments, or the company as a whole. See KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS; PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT. 
## Source[^3]
- A variable used to determine the employment of policy instruments. An indicator is used to show when a policy should be introduced, or when the level of an existing policy instrument should be changed. Policy indicators are distinguished from both targets and instruments. Economic policy targets include objectives such as high levels of employment and growth, low and stable levels of inflation, or maintenance of particular exchange rates. Policy instruments are variables the government or central bank can control, or at least influence, such as tax rates or the money supply. Policy indicators may themselves be targets, but frequently are not. They are preferred to targets for use in decision-making because they are available sooner or can be measured more reliably than targets. Policy instruments cannot be indicators for the authority that decides them, but where decision-making is decentralized, one authority's instrument may be used as another's indicator. See also ECONOMIC INDICATORS; LEADING INDICATOR.
