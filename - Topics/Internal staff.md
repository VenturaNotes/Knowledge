## Synthesis
### Alpha Testing
- Internal staff can include non-developer employees such as
	- [[product manager|product managers]]
	- [[designers]]
	- [[customer support representatives]]
	- [[stakeholders]] 
		- #question How is a stakeholder an internal staff? Aren't internal staff just those that work for a company?
- They do this because it provides diverse perspectives on usability, functionality, and potential issues
- While their primary job roles many not be software testing, they might be involved in  [[user acceptance testing]] (UAT) or [[dogfooding]] (where employees use the product internally to find flaws).
- They are indirectly part of the [[Software Development Life Cycle|SDLC]] in the sense that their feedback influences development, but they typically do not engage in coding or technical testing like developers.
	- #question What kind of technical testing would developers do?
