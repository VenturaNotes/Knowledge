- Describing a plant that contains little permanent woody tissue. The aerial parts of the plant die back after the growing season. In annuals the whole plant dies; in biennials and herbaceous perennials the plant has organs (e.g. bulbs or corms) that are modified to survive beneath the soil in unfavorable conditions.
