- A bell that hangs in the underwriting room at Lloyd's and is rung for ceremonial occasions, and rarely to draw the attention of underwriters to an important announcement. It was formerly rung once if a ship sank and twice for good news. It was recovered from the Lutine, a ship that was insured by Lloyd's and sank in the North Sea in 1799, with a cargo of bullion ( $Â£ 1.4 \mathrm{M}$ value).
