- The maximum utility level a consumer can achieve expressed as a function of prices and income. Consider a consumer choosing the quantities $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ of two goods to maximize utility subject to a budget constraint. The utility maximization problem is$$\max _{\left\{x_{1}, x_{2}\right\}} U\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right) \text { subject to } M=p_{1} x_{1}+p_{2} x_{2}.$$The solution is described by the two Marshallian demand functions $x_1 = d_{1}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, M\right)$ and $x_{2}=d_{2}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, M\right)$. Substituting the optimal choices back into the utility function gives the maximized level of utility as$$V\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, M\right) \equiv U\left(d_{1}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, M\right), d_{2}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, M\right)\right)$$The function $V\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, M\right)$ is the indirect utility function. Denote the marginal utility of income by $\alpha$. Roy's identity states that $\partial V / \partial p_{i}=-\alpha x_{i}$, a result that is useful for calculating the welfare consequences of a price change. See also EXPENDITURE FUNCTION.
