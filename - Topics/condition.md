- (1) A major term of a contract that, if unfulfilled, constitutes a fundamental breach of contract and may invalidate it. Compare WARRANTY. 
- (2) A provision that does not form part of a contract but either suspends the contract until a specified event has happened (condition precedent) or brings it to an end in specified circumstances (condition subsequent). An example of a condition precedent is an agreement to buy a particular car if it passes its MOT test; an example of a condition subsequent is an agreement that entitles the purchaser of goods to return them if they prove unsatisfactory.
