- Frequency-hopping Multiple Access (FHMA) is known as spread-spectrum transmission, a technology that allows data and voice communications to simultaneously share the same communication medium. FHMA works by transmitting and receiving stations by changing the frequency rapidly in a semi-random sequence among many separate and distinct radio channels. The transceivers are synchronized with a "hopping sequence" that comes from an algorithm, one that can be changed to avoid interference and other transmissions from the frequency band.
