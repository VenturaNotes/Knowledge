- A company that owns and operates stock exchanges in Scandinavia and the Baltic States; it also markets advanced electronic trading systems for derivatives products that are used in many other exchanges worldwide. It originated in 1985 as an options exchange in Stockholm; this later moved to London (1990-2003) to circumvent changes in Sweden's tax regime. OMX acquired the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1998, the Helsinki Exchange in 2003, and the Copenhagen Exchange in 2005. In 2008 it became a wholly owned subsidiary of NASDAQ.
