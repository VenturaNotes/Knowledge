- A screenshot, also known as a screen capture, is an image file that captures the digital display of a desktop or mobile device's screen. Screenshots can capture an individual application window or the entirety of a computer or mobile device user's screen. Once a screenshot is captured, it is stored as an image file. Screenshots save device users the trouble of having to use another device to take a picture of their device's screen.
