- Nomophobia (short for no mobile phone phobia) is a term used to describe a psychological disorder people experience when they are afraid of being detached from their cellular device. Symptoms of nomophobia include anxiety, depression, and feelings of isolation. Smartphones have provided younger generations with a constant connection with others, however, these online connections have replaced face-to-face relationships. This can lead to social anxiety and feelings of awkwardness when those who are attached to a mobile device are put into a social setting without one. Personal insecurity is a huge driving force for those with nomophobia, since their online social circle is constantly accessible to them. Unlimited access to technology at home, school, and work has significantly increased cases of nomophobia. This access is thought to make work life more efficient, but it has been reported that nomophobia has reduced work productivity and performance, making businesses suffer as a whole.
