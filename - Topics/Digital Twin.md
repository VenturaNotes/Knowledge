- A digital twin is a virtual model of a real object or system. Digital twins recreate physical objects, processes, organizations, or people to study their abilities without actually having to physically test them in the real world. Usually, multiple sensors will be placed on the physical object to help recreate different parts of the physical objectâ€™s performance on the virtual model (such as energy, temperature, speed, movement patterns, and more).
