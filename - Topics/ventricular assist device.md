- (VAD) a mechanical pump implanted in the body for the purpose of taking over some or all of the pumping action of the heart in patients with severe heart damage. Support may be given to the left ventricle (LVAD), right ventricle (RVAD), or both. Most such devices require thoracotomy, but a percutaneous device is now also available. This is usually regarded as a temporary measure until the heart has recovered or is transplanted.
