- An array of microtubules that organizes cell division following mitosis in certain algae, e.g. Chlamydomonas. Unlike the phragmoplast found in dividing cells of plants and many algae, the phycoplast consists of microtubules arranged perpendicular to the axis of the mitotic spindle and parallel to the plane of formation of the new cell wall. The new wall may form by infurrowing from the existing walls or by deposition of a cell plate.
