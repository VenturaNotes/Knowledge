- A form of autarchy; an economy without contacts with the rest of the world by means of trade and movement of capital and labour. Examples of economies that existed as autarchies during certain periods in their history are Japan between the 1600s and the 1850s, Spain in the 1940s and 1950s, Albania in the late 1970s to mid-1980s, and currently North Korea; however, in almost all such cases some trade with neighboring countries took place. A model of a closed economy is used in many theoretical applications as an abstraction, when the introduction of the outside trade, as well as the movement of capital and labour, may complicate the analysis without affecting the main issue under consideration.

- A theoretical model of an economy that neither imports nor exports and is therefore independent of economic factors in the outside world. No such economy exists, although the foreign sector of the US economy is a relatively small and most economic decisions are taken by the US government independently of the rest of the world.
