## Source [^1]
- (visual purple) $n$. a pigment in the retina of the eye, within the rods, consisting of retinal $\textendash$ an aldehyde of retinol (vitamin A) $\textendash$ and a protein. The presence of rhodopsin is essential for vision in dim light. It is bleached in the presence of light and this stimulates nervous activity in the rods.
## Source[^2]
- (visual purple) The light-sensitive pigment found in the rods of the vertebrate retina. It consists of a protein component, opsin, linked to a nonprotein chromophore, retinal (or retinene), a derivative of vitamin A. Light falling on the rod is absorbed by the retinal, which changes its form and separates from the opsin component; this initiates the transmission of a nerve impulse to the brain via an intracellular signalling cascade involving the G protein transducin. The great sensitivity of rhodopsin allows vision in dim light (night vision). See also DARK ADAPTATION.
