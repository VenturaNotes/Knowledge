- (visual reinforced audiometry, VRA) a behavioral test of hearing for children aged approximately 6 to 30 months in which the subject sits between two calibrated loudspeakers. A sound is generated from one loudspeaker. Children who turn towards the sound are rewarded by brief illumination of a toy adjacent to the loudspeaker. Older children can be tested with headphones, rather than using the loudspeakers, to enable each ear to be tested separately. The test can be adapted for use with older subjects who have learning disabilities.
