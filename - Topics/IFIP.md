- International Federation for Information Processing, founded in 1959 under the auspices of UNESCO and coming into official existence in 1960. It is a multinational federation of professional/technical societies, or groups of such societies, concerned with information processing. Each member country has only one such society or group as a full member. IFIP aims to 'promote information science and technology, advance international cooperation in the field of information processing, stimulate research, development, and application of information processing, further dissemination and exchange of information on information processing, and encourage education in information processing'.
