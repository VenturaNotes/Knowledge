## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Cell splitting refers to the technical process in which cells are split into two or more cells. This does not reduce the power of the cells involved with the split. However, it does increase the capacity of that system. When cells are split, they can handle additional functions or data. This process, which is typically used in electronics, can then increase the number of channels per unit, and makes existing cells more efficient by increasing data speed.
