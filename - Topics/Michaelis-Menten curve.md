- A graph that shows the relationship between the concentration of a substrate and the rate of the corresponding enzyme-controlled reaction. Named after L. Michaelis (1875-1949) and M. L. Menten (1879-1960), the curve only applies to enzyme reactions involving a single substrate. The graph can be used to calculate the Michaelis constant $\left(K_{m}\right)$, which is the concentration of a substrate required in order for an enzyme to act at half of its maximum velocity $\left(V_{\max }\right)$. The Michaelis constant is a measure of the affinity of an enzyme for a substrate. A low value corresponds to a high affinity, and vice versa. See also ENZYME KINETICS.
