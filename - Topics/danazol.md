- $n$. a synthetic progestogen that inhibits the secretion by the pituitary gland of gonadotrophins. It is used to treat endometriosis, severe pain associated with cystic breast tumors, and severe urticaria. Possible side-effects include nausea, rashes, swelling of the feet and ankles, weight gain, oiliness of the skin, and, in women, menstrual disturbances, excessive growth of facial and body hair, and irreversible voice changes. Because of the severity of these effects, danazol is now rarely used in gynaecology.
