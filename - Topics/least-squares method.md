- $n$. In statistics, a technique for estimating the value of an unknown quantity from a number of observations or scores, especially for finding the line or curve that best fits a set of data points, by finding the values that minimize the sum of the squared deviations of the observed scores from their expected values. The method was introduced in 1805 by the French mathematician Adrien-Marie Legendre (1752-1833).
