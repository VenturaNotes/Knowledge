- $n$. the process by which blood clots are removed from the circulation, involving digestion of the insoluble protein fibrin by the enzyme plasmin. The latter exists in the plasma as an inactive precursor (plasminogen), which is activated in parallel with the blood coagulation process. Normally a balance is maintained between the processes of coagulation and fibrinolysis in the body; an abnormal increase in fibrinolysis leads to excessive bleeding.
