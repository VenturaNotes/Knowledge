- A real function $f$ on an interval $[a, b]$ is said to have bounded variation if the set of values$$\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|f\left(x_{i}\right)-f\left(x_{i-1}\right)\right|$$is bounded above where $a=x_{0}<x_{1}<\ldots<x_{n}=b$ is any partition of the interval.
- Differentiable functions with bounded derivatives have bounded variation. $x \cos (1 / x)$ is an example of a function which does not have bounded variation.
