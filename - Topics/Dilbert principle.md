- The adage that large corporations knowingly promote their most incompetent staff to higher management, in the hope that this will prevent them from doing too much harm. The assumption is that all the real work of a company is done by those lower in the hierarchy. The principle was formulated by the US cartoonist Scott Adams (1957-), creator of the Dilbert comic strip. See also Parkinson's laws; Peter principle.
