## Synthesis
- Also known as a linear space
- A vector space is a collection of objects (called vectors) that can be added together and multiplied by numbers (scalars) such that the results remain within the same collection. 
	- It must follow specific rules, such as the existence of a [[zero vector]] and the property that adding vectors in any order gives the same result.
	- #question Are these the only rules of a vector space or are there more?
- Example
	- Most common example: $\mathbb{R}^2$
		- It is the set of all pairs of real numbers $(x, y)$. This represents the standard 2D Cartesian plane.
