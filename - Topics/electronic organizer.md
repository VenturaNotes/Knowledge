- A pocket-sized computer with a smaller than standard keyboard and an LCD screen, designed to fulfil the function of a paper-based personal organizer. It normally has a less sophisticated operating system than a laptop or desktop computer, but has efficient scheduling, alarms, note-taking and address-book functions and will allow the transfer of information between itself and larger machines. They have been almost entirely superseded by the emergence of the smartphone.
