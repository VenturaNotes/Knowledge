- Taxation that is intended to be borne by persons or organizations other than those who pay the tax (compare DIRECT TAXATION). The principal indirect tax in the UK is VAT, which is paid by traders as goods or services enter into the chain of production, but which is ultimately borne by the consumer of the goods or services. One of the advantages of indirect taxes is that they can be collected from comparatively few sources while their economic effects can be widespread.
