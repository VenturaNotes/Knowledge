## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A code that is designed for channel coding, i.e. for encoding information so that a decoder can correct, with a high probability of success, any errors caused in the signal by an intervening noisy channel.
- Error-correcting codes may be block codes or convolutional codes, and in either case are employed in a forward error-correction system. The most common error-correcting block codes are the Hamming codes, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, simplex codes, and the Golay $(23,12)$ code.
- Since errors may be corrected by detecting them and requesting retransmission, the process of error correction is sometimes taken to include backward error-correction systems and, hence, error-detecting codes.
