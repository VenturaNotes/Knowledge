- The error incurred in cutting short an infinite process after finitely many terms or iterations, or by not proceeding to the limit. It represents one of the main sources of error in numerical methods for the algorithmic solution of continuous problems. Its analysis and methods for its estimation and control are central problems in numerical analysis. In the numerical solution of differential equations it is closely related to the concept of discretization error.
