- One of some 80 chartered companies in the City of London that are descended from medieval craft guilds. Now largely social and charitable institutions, livery companies owe their name to the elaborate ceremonial dress (livery) worn by their officers. Several support independent schools (e.g. Merchant Taylors, Haberdashers, Mercers) and although none are now trading companies, some still have some involvement in their trades (e.g. Fishmongers). In 1878 they joined together to form the City and Guilds of London Institute, which founded the City and Guilds College of the Imperial College of Science and Technology and has been involved in other forms of technical education.
