- A personal storage table (PST) is a data file format that Microsoft Outlook, Microsoft Exchange Client, and Windows Messaging use to store messages, attachments, contacts, and other business communications data. Business professionals often use PST files to store emails and included attachments on their computerâ€™s local hard drive. This gives company employees offline access to their Microsoft Outlook email communications and contact book, thereby reducing the amount of data stored on their email server.
- Businesses encourage employees to use encryption services when storing PST files on their local hard drive to ensure security of sensitive company communications.
