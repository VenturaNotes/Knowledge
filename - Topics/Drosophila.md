- $n$. a genus of very small flies, commonly called fruit flies, that breed in decaying fruit and vegetables. D. melanogaster has been extensively used in genetic research as it has only four pairs of chromosomes and those in its salivary glands are easily recognizable. Adult D. repleta sometimes feed on faecal matter and may transmit disease organisms.
## Source[^2]
- A genus of fruit flies often used in genetic and developmental biology research because the larvae possess giant chromosomes in their salivary glands (see POLYTENY). These chromosomes have conspicuous transverse bands, which can be studied microscopically to reveal chromosome mutations and gene activity. Fruit flies have a short life cycle and produce a large number of offspring, which also makes them a good model animal for genetic research.
