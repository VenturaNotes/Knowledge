- Any technique to compress speech in order to use less bandwidth when transmitting. Various standardized techniques are used in Europe and the US, most of which employ lossy compression.
- GSM 06.10 is used by many European wireless telephones. It uses residual pulse excitation/long-term prediction (RPE/LTP) coding and compresses 160 frames of 13-bit samples into 260 bits. A sample rate of 8 kHz is used. It is being replaced by the Enhanced Full Rate and Adaptive Multi-Rate standards, which provide better speech quality. MELP is the US Department of Defense's mixed excitation linear prediction voice coder; it is also used by NATO.
