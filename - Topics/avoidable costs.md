- Costs that will not be incurred if a particular course of action is not taken. For example, if a specific product is not produced, certain material and labour costs may be avoided. Variable costs are often avoidable costs, whereas fixed costs, such as business rates, are not avoidable in the short term. See also RELEVANT COST.
