- the portion of the central nervous system enclosed in the vertebral column, consisting of nerve cells and bundles of nerves connecting all parts of the body with the brain. It contains a core of grey matter surrounded by white matter (see illustration overleaf). It is enveloped in three layers of membrane, the meninges, and extends from the medulla oblongata in the skull to the level of the second lumbar vertebra. From it arise 31 pairs of spinal nerves.

## Source[^2]
- The part of the vertebrate central nervous system that is posterior to the brain and enclosed within the vertebral column. It consists of a hollow core of grey matter (Hshaped in cross section) surrounded by an outer layer of white matter; the central cavity contains cerebrospinal fluid. The white matter contains numerous longitudinal nerve fibers organized into distinct tracts: ascending tracts consist of sensory neurons, conducting impulses towards the brain; descending tracts consist of motor neurons, transmitting impulses from the brain. Paired spinal nerves arise from the spinal cord.
