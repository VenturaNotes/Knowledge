- A certificate giving abbreviated details of the cover provided by an insurance policy. In a motor-insurance policy or an employers' liability insurance policy, the information that must be shown on the certificate of insurance is laid down by law and in both cases the policy cover does not come into force until the certificate has been delivered to the policyholder.
