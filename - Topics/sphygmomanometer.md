- $n$. an instrument for measuring blood pressure in the arteries. It consists of an inflatable cuff connected to a graduated scale gauge calibrated in millimetres of mercury ( mmHg ). The cuff is applied to a limb (usually the arm) and inflated to exert pressure on a large artery until the blood flow stops. The pressure is then slowly released and, with the aid of a stethoscope to listen to the pulse, it is possible to determine both the systolic and diastolic pressures (which can be read on the scale). Automated electronic devices are increasingly used.
