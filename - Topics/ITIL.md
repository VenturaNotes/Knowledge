- The Information Technology Infrastructure Library, or ITIL, is a collection of detailed and proven best practices within IT services and its related activities, including IT asset management and service management. Axelos owns and manages the ITIL and offers organizations licenses to make use of the ITIL framework. ITIL has gone from having 30 books drawn up from global sources in the 1980s to just five books currently. Each book focuses on a phase of the IT-related service lifecycle and encompasses service strategy, service operation, service transition, service design, and continuous service improvement.
