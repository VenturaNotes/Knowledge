- $n$. a group of cells in the hypothalamus that monitor blood concentration. Should this increase abnormally, as in dehydration, the osmoreceptors send nerve impulses to the hypothalamus, which then increases the rate of release of vasopressin from the posterior pituitary gland. Loss of water from the body in the urine is thus restricted until the blood concentration returns to normal.
## Source[^2]
- Any of numerous neurons in the hypothalamus of the vertebrate brain that respond to an increase in the osmolality of the blood. This results in the release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) and the subsequent conservation of water, thereby maintaining the homeostasis of the body fluids.
