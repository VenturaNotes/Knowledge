- A substance found in geological deposits that is indicative of a particular species or group of organisms that lived when the deposits were formed. Such a substance should ideally be uniquely associated with the organisms in question and either resist chemical breakdown over geological time or decay into products that are unambiguous and predictable. Examples include the isoprene residues indicative of ancient archaeans, and oleanane, a defence chemical found only in flowering plants.
