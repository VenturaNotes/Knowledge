- Work carried out in a person's own home or workshop rather than on a company's premises. The term is mainly applied to poorly paid manual work, as opposed to white-collar teleworking. In Western countries, the use of outworkers declined in the earlier part of the 20th century but the practice is still common in developing economies (e.g. in the garment industry).
