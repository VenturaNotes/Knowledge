- (Hz) The SI unit of frequency. A periodic phenomenon has a frequency of one hertz if each cycle of the phenomenon repeats itself in a period of one second. A megahertz $(\mathrm{MHz})$ is one million $\left(10^{6}\right)$ hertz; a gigahertz $(\mathrm{GHz})$ is 1000 million $\left(10^{9}\right)$ hertz.

- $n$. The unit of frequency (1) known non-technically as cycles per second. Alternating current (mains electricity) cycles at 50 hertz in the UK and at 60 hertz in the US, Middle C has a frequency of 256 hertz, and EEG alpha waves have frequencies in the region of $8\text{-}10$ hertz. Hz abbrev. \[Named after the German physicist Heinrich Rudolph Hertz (1857-94) who discovered radio waves in 1887]
