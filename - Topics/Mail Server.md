- A mail server is a computer server that receives electronic mail (email) from a client computer and delivers it to other client computers or mail servers. There are two types of mail servers: incoming mail servers and outgoing mail servers. Incoming mail servers store mail and send it directly to a user's inbox. Outgoing mail servers utilize the senderâ€™s computer to communicate with Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP), which delivers the outgoing email. Mail servers are often referred to by a variety of different names, including a mail transfer, transport agent MTA, mail router, or an internet mailer.
