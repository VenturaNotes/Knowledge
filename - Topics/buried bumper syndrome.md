- a condition in which feeding via a PEG tube (see GASTROSTOMY) is blocked. It occurs when the internal retention disc (bumper) of the tube, which holds it in place inside the stomach, is overgrown by hypertrophic gastric mucosa and becomes embedded in the stomach wall. This serious complication requires surgical removal of the tube. It can be prevented by correct tube care: advancing, retracting, and rotating of the tube.
