## Synthesis
### Operations and Structures not Applicable
#### Division over Addition or Subtraction
- The distributive property does not hold for division over addition or subtraction
- $$a \div (b+c) \ne (a \div b) + (a \div c)$$
#### Matrix Multiplication
- Matrix multiplication is distributive over matrix addition but not [[commutative]]
- $$A(B + C) = AB + AC$$
- Distributive property of [[matrix multiplication]]  does not extend to operations like
	- [[scalar division]] or [[element-wise operations]]
#### Vector Cross Product
- The [[cross product]] is not distributive over [[vector addition]]
	- #question can you only have a cross product of vectors?
	- $$a \times (b + c) \ne (a \times b) + (a\times c)$$
- The cross product is linear but behaves differently compared to simple [[scalar multiplication]]
	- #question what does it mean for the cross product to be linear?
#### Non-commutative operations
- In some [[algebraic structures]], such as certain [[non-commutative rings]] or [[semigroups]], the distributive property may only hold for specific operations (like multiplication over addition), and other operations may fail to distribute in the usual way
