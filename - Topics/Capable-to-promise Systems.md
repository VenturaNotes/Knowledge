- Capable-to-promise (CTP) systems enable companies to fulfill customer orders within a particular time frame. These systems measure or predict inventory and production/resource capacity so businesses can manage supply and demand effectively. CTP tools take into account factors such as production capacities, constraints, planned work, work in process, availability, equipment, labor, and materials. They can analyze multiple components of a supply chain network and its production processes, including supplier networks, to calculate time-critical order fulfillment workflows.
