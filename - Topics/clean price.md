- The price of a bond excluding the accrued interest since the previous dividend payment. Interest on fixed-interest securities accrues continuously although dividends are paid at fixed intervals (usually six months). Prices quoted in newspapers and other media outlets are usually clean prices, as are those given on US bond markets. On UK and European markets it is customary to quote the dirty price, i.e. the price of the bond including any unpaid interest. This is the price actually paid by the buyer.
