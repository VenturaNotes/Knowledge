- Inductive reasoning is a logical process that involves using evidence to propose a theory. In data science, inductive reasoning is used to make predictions when only a limited amount of evidence is present. Typically, this process involves taking a small data sample and using it to infer information about a larger population.
- It is possible for the inductive reasoning process to produce inaccurate conclusions, as the conclusions it produces aren't mathematically certain.
