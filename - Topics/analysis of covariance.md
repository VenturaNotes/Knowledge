- $n$. In statistics, a technique of data analysis based on analysis of variance (ANOVA) that uses statistical control to remove the effect of an extraneous variable, known or assumed to be correlated with the dependent variable, and analyses the portion of the variance in the dependent variable explained by one or more independent variables excluding the extraneous variable. In psychology, it is often used to suppress extraneous subject variables such as intelligence or age that cannot be controlled by randomization. See also analysis of COVARIANCE STRUCTURES, COVARIATE. ANCOVA abbrev.
