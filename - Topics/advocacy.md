- $n$. a role that involves acting as a proxy or speaking on behalf of a patient because the patient lacks capacity. Under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, capacitous adults may legally nominate a proxy or an advocate to make health-care decisions on their behalf in the event of losing capacity. For patients without family or legally appointed advocates, the Independent Mental Capacity Advocate should be contacted when making significant medical decisions. Health-care professionals may see their role as including advocacy for patients, e.g. in accessing services. In addition, there are many organized advocacy groups to support patients with specific conditions, such as Alzheimer's disease. Finally, every NHS trust has a Patient Advice and Liaison Service (PALS), which can take on the role of supporting patients. See also PROXY DECISION; SUBSTITUTED JUDGMENT.
