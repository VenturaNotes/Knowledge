- (1913 - 96) Hungarian mathematician who was prolific in his output, publishing more than 1500 papers, many of them jointly as he collaborated with a wide range of other mathematicians. He sought elegant and simple solutions to complex problems, which requires insight into the essential nature of the problem, as well as the technical mathematics to extract the solution. He was awarded the Wolf Prize in 1983 for contributions to number theory, combinatorics, probability, set theory, and analysis.
