- (threshold gate) A logic element whose output is determined by comparing a weighted sum of inputs with a predetermined/prescribed threshold value. If the threshold is exceeded, the output is a logic 1 ; if not, the output is logic 0 . If the number of inputs is odd, if the weights are all equal, and the threshold is equal to half of the number of inputs, then the threshold element behaves as a majority element.
- A system of threshold elements is described by or as threshold logic. See also TERNARY THRESHOLD GATE.
