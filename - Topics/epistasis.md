- (1) the stopping of a flow or discharge, as of blood. 
- (2) a type of gene action in which one gene can suppress the action of another (nonallelic) gene. The term is sometimes used for any interaction between nonallelic genes. -epistatic adj.
## Source[^2]
- A gene interaction in which one gene (i.e. the epistatic gene) suppresses the effect of another gene (i.e. the hypostatic gene) that is situated at a different locus on the chromosome. For example, in guinea pigs the gene that controls the production of melanin is epistatic to the gene that regulates the deposition of melanin. A dominant allele $(C)$ is responsible for the production of melanin, while the amount of melanin deposited is controlled by a second gene, which determines whether the coat color is black or brown. If an animal is homozygous recessive (cc) for melanin production, the coat color will be white regardless of the alleles that produce black or brown coloration.
