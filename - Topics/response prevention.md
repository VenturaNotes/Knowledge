- a form of behavior therapy given for severe obsessions. Patients are encouraged to abstain from rituals and repetitive acts while they are in situations that arouse anxiety. For example, a handwashing ritual might be treated by stopping washing while being progressively exposed to dirt. The anxiety then declines, and with it the obsessions.
