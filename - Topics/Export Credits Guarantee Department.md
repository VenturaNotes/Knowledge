- (ECGD) A UK government department that now operates under the name UK Export Finance. It encourages exports from the UK by making export credit insurance available to exporters and guaranteeing repayment to UK banks that provide finance for exports on credit terms of two years or more. It also insures British private investment overseas against war risk, expropriation, and restrictions on the making of remittances. Some sections of the ECGD were privatized in 1991, including short-term credit insurance.

## Source[^2]
- (ECGD) A UK government department$\textemdash$now known as UK Export Finance$\textemdash$responsible for encouraging UK exports by insuring exporters against risks. These include both the risk of default on the part of export customers, and the risk of loss through the imposition of import licensing or exchange controls by the importers' governments. Export credits may be for any period up to ten years; the premiums charged may constitute an implicit subsidy if they fail to reflect the full cost of risks.
