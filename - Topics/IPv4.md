- Version of the [[Internet Protocol]] used for addressing and routing packets in network communication
- Uses 32-bit addresses
- Still widely used but facing address exhaustion issues. This is due to the limited number of available IPv4 addresses (32-bit addresses), which are nearly depleted as more devices connect to the internet (only allows for approximately 4.3 billion unique IP addresses). This is based on $2^{32}$ addresses
	- This led to the adoption of [[IPv6]] (128-bit addresses) to accommodate the growing number of connected devices
