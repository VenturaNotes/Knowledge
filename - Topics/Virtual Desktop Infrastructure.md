- A VDI (or virtual desktop infrastructure) is a process that consists of using virtual machines to connect and manage virtual desktops. Through these virtual machines, employees can remotely access all of the data that they would be able to access from a desktop computer in the office. This is done by connecting the data to a server instead of directly storing it on a device, such as a laptop, cell phone, or a tablet. To access the virtual desktop, users log in using a portal, and the information is accessible on the cloud.
