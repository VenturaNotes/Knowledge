- Debt issued by a national government in the form of bonds in a reserve currency. The level of risk in the bond is reflected in the rate of interest payable on it. Traditionally, sovereign debt had been considered low-risk, as governments were believed to have a variety of means to ensure they did not default on their obligations. However, since the 1990s there have been several sovereign debt crises, in which high ratios of debt to GDP have resulted in a perceived risk of default on sovereign bonds. Following the financial crisis of 2008-09, sovereign debt in some eurozone countries, notably Greece and Cyprus, reached levels that required international intervention to avoid the risk of default (see European Stability Mechanism).
