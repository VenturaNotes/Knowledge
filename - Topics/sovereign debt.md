- Debt issued by a national government in the form of bonds in a reserve currency. The level of risk in the bond is reflected in the rate of interest payable on it. Traditionally, sovereign debt had been considered low-risk, as governments were believed to have a variety of means to ensure they did not default on their obligations. However, since the 1990s there have been several sovereign debt crises, in which high ratios of debt to GDP have resulted in a perceived risk of default on sovereign bonds. Following the financial crisis of 2008-09, sovereign debt in some eurozone countries, notably Greece and Cyprus, reached levels that required international intervention to avoid the risk of default (see European Stability Mechanism).

- Debt of the governments of independent countries. With the debt of an individual or corporation, it is generally possible to use legal procedures compelling them to pay the interest and redemption payments due, or to hand their assets over to the creditor if they do not pay. Such legal sanctions are not available against governments, unless they choose to submit voluntarily to legal procedures. There is thus a risk that sovereign debt may be subject to repudiation, interest reductions, or compulsory rescheduling. The only protection for the creditors of sovereign debtors is the borrowers' concern about loss of reputation: default makes it difficult or expensive for them to borrow in the future.
