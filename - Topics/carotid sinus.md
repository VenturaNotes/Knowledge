- a pocket in the wall of the carotid artery, at its division in the neck, containing receptors that monitor blood pressure (see BARORECEPTOR). When blood pressure is raised, impulses travel from the receptors to the vasomotor centre in the brain, which initiates a reflex vasodilatation and slowing of heart rate to lower the blood pressure to normal.
