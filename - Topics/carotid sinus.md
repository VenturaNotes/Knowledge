- a pocket in the wall of the carotid artery, at its division in the neck, containing receptors that monitor blood pressure (see BARORECEPTOR). When blood pressure is raised, impulses travel from the receptors to the vasomotor center in the brain, which initiates a reflex vasodilatation and slowing of heart rate to lower the blood pressure to normal.
## Source[^2]
- An enlarged region of the carotid artery at its major branching point in the neck. Its walls contain many receptors that are sensitive to changes in pressure and it regulates blood pressure by initiating reflex changes in heart rate and dilation of blood vessels.
