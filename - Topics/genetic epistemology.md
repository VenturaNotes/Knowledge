- $n$. The term used by the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980) to describe the nature of his own research. He began his research career with the ambition of contributing to epistemology, believing that many epistemological problems were in fact empirical questions and that a genetic (by which he meant developmental) approach would be most fruitful. His three-volume series specifically devoted to genetic epistemology, Introduction à l'Épistémologie Génétique (1950) covers various branches of knowledge, including mathematics, logic, physics, biology, psychology, and sociology, all from an epistemological point of view. See also Piagetian.
