- a refusal to behave in a socially or legally accepted way because such behavior is counter to one's personal beliefs, principles, or values. Conscientious objection is commonly, but not always, based on religious belief. In some areas of medical practice, there is legal provision allowing for conscientious objection; for example, by virtue of the Abortion Act 1967, section 4(1), a doctor can lawfully refuse to perform an abortion on the grounds of a conscientious objection but must refer the patient to a colleague who will carry out the procedure. Adherents of some religious denominations, such as Jehovah's Witnesses, may refuse life-saving treatments, frequently those involving blood products, on the grounds of conscience and religious belief, and provided the patient has capacity, a doctor is bound to respect the wishes or autonomy of the patient.
