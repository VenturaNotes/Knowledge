- An apparatus used for measuring heats of combustion. It consists of a strong container in which the sample is sealed with excess oxygen and ignited electrically. The heat of combustion at constant volume can be calculated from the resulting rise in temperature. The apparatus is used to calculate the calorific values of foods and the energy content of a sample of biomass, required for constructing a pyramid of energy.
