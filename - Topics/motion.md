- A proposal put before a meeting for discussion. Usually members of a company who attend a meeting of the company receive a notice of motion to enable them to consider the motion before the meeting. If the motion is passed by a majority of the members of the company it becomes a resolution. If the meeting decides to amend the motion, the amended motion, known as the substantive motion, is then discussed and voted upon.
