- A sharp conical tooth in mammals that is large and highly developed in carnivores (e.g. dogs) for tearing meat. There are two canines in each jaw, each situated between the second incisor and the first premolar. In some animals (e.g. herbivores, such as giraffes and rabbits) canine teeth are absent.
