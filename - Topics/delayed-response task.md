- $n$. A test of working memory in which the human or non-human organism responds on the basis of stored internal representations rather than information currently present in the environment. Typically, the organism receives a brief visual or auditory stimulus that is then withdrawn, and after a delay of several seconds attempts to identify the location where the stimulus appeared, and is rewarded if correct.
