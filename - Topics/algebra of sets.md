- The power set $\wp(E)$ of all subsets of a universal set $E$ is closed under the binary operations $\cup$(union) and $\cap$(intersection), $+$(symmetric difference) and the unary operation ' (complementation). The following are some of the properties, or laws, that hold for subsets, A, B, and C of E:
	- (i) $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C, A + (B + C) = (A + B) + C$ and $A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B)\cap C$, the associative properties
	- (ii) $A \cup B = B \cup A, A + B = B + A,$ and $A \cap B = B \cap A$, the commutative properties.
	- (iii) $A \cup \varnothing = A, A + \varnothing = A$ and $A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing$, where $\varnothing$ is the empty set
