- a hearing test used in preschool children in which the child must discriminate between similar speech sounds. The test consists of 14 toys that are paired because their names sound similar; for example, tree and key, plane and plate. Having first identified all the objects, the child is then asked in a quiet voice to indicate a particular toy (e.g. Can you find the key?).
