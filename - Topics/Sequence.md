## Source[^2]
- (1) A function whose domain is the set of positive integers (or sometimes the set of nonnegative integers). The image set can thus be listed $s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots$ where $s_{i}$ is the value of the function given argument $i$. A finite sequence (or list) is a function whose domain is$$\{1,2, \ldots, n\} \text { for } n \geq 1$$and hence whose image set can be listed$$s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots, s_{n}$$
- (2) The listing of the image set of a sequence. Hence it is another name for string.
