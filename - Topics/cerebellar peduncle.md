- $n$. Any of three paired bundles of nerve fibers connecting the cerebellum to the midbrain and the medulla oblongata. The superior, middle, and inferior cerebellar peduncles receive afferent inputs from most of the external sense organs (touch, vision, and hearing) and the vestibular system and send efferent outputs to the thalamus and various nuclei in the midbrain and brainstem. Compare CEREBRAL PEDUNCLE. \[From Latin pedunculus, a corruption of pediculus a little foot, from pes, pedis a foot]
