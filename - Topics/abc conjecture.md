- A significant and open conjecture in number theory first made in the 1980s. Given $\epsilon > 0$, the conjecture saying that there are finitely many triplets $(a, b, c)$ of coprime positive integers such that $a+b=c$ and $c > rad(abc)^{\upvarepsilon + 1}$. Here rad($n$) denotes the product of the distinct prime factors of $n$. If true, it would imply other theorems and conjectures including the Mordell Conjecture, Catalan's conjecture, and Fermat's Last Theorem.
