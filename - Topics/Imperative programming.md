- Imperative programming is a software development approach in which a software developer programs an application by telling it how to accomplish tasks. In imperative programming, functions are coded step-by-step, directly communicating to a program how to solve a problem. This programming technique does not use pre-coded models, only functions that are explicitly stated. Commonly used procedural and object-oriented programming (OOP) languages, such as C, C#, C++, and Java, are often used to facilitate imperative programming.
