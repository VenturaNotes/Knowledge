- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a sexual theory, often adopted by children, that confuses the female vagina and the anus, recognizing only one orifice that is believed to function as a birth canal and also for defecation and coitus. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) first referred to it in 1908 in an article 'On the Sexual Theories of Children' (Standard Edition, IX, pp. 209-26). According to Freud, children of both sexes tend to believe that 'the baby must be evacuated, like a piece of excrement, like a stool' (p. 219). Also called cloaca theory. \[From cloaca the pelvic cavity of most vertebrates, apart from higher mammals, into which both the alimentary canal and the genital ducts open, from Latin cloaca a sewer, from Greek klyzein to wash out]
