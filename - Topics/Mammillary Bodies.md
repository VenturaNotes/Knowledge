## Synthesis
- Receives information from the hippocampus and relays them to the thalamus and cingulate cortex which is thought to be important in memory consolidation
## Source[^1]
- Part of the circuitry involved in memory processes within the limbic system. Contributes to recollection, retrieval, consolidation, spatial memory, emotional memory, and contextual memory, supporting the formation and retention of various types of memories.
- Acts as a relay station and processing center within the memory system. Crucial for spatial memory, episdodic memory, and potentially procedural memory. 
	- Collaborates with other brain regions to solidify and consolidate memories
- Receives information from hippocampus. Part of circuit called  the Papez circuit which is believed to be involved in memory consolidation
- Process information from the hippocampus and then relay signals to other brain regions involved in memory, such as the thalamus and cingulate cortex.
	- Creates a loop thought to be important in memory consolidation
