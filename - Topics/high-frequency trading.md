- (HFT) A computerized trading strategy in which complex algorithms are used to generate and execute orders at high speed, so that large volumes of shares may be held for very short periods of time before being automatically resold. The role of HFT in sudden market movements or 'flash crashes' has made the practice controversial. Although the US Securities and Exchange Commission has sought to regulate such trading, it now accounts for a majority of all equities trades in the USA and Europe.
