- Radiation is energy that moves from one place to another in a form that can be described as waves or particles 
- Exposed to it everyday such as
	- sun
	- [[microwave ovens]]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. energy in the form of waves or particles, especially electromagnetic radiation, which includes (in order of increasing energy) radio waves, microwaves, infrared rays (radiant heat), visible light, ultraviolet rays, X-rays, and gamma rays. The latter two are described as ionizing radiation due to their effect on other atoms and are potentially harmful. Particle radiation is described as alpha (a helium nucleus), beta (an electron), or positron emission. Only the latter is commonly used for diagnostic imaging (see POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY).

- (2) (in physics) A stream of particles, especially alpha- or beta-particles from a radioactive source or neutrons from a nuclear reactor. See also BACKGROUND RADIATION. 
- (3) (in evolution) See ADAPTIVE RADIATION.
