- The correct prediction of future events. If there is no uncertainty then an agent can have perfect foresight if they know all relevant information and have a correct model to use for prediction. When there is uncertainty it is not possible to have perfect foresight. Instead, the relevant concept is that of rational expectations so that the prediction is the most accurate possible given the information available.
