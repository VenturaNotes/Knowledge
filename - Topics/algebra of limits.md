- A collection of results relating to algebraic rules of convergence. If real (or complex) sequences $a_n$ and $b_n$ converge to limits $A$ and $B$, then $a_n + b_n$ converges to $A + B$, $a_nb_n$ converges to $AB$ and $a_n/b_n$ converges to $A/B$ provided $B \ne 0 \ne b_n$. Similar results apply to the sums of series and limits of functions.
