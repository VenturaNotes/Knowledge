- The promotion by a retailer of selected products. Commonly used techniques include displays to encourage impulse buying, free samples and gifts, and temporary price reductions. Merchandising policy is usually designed to influence the retailer's sales pattern and is influenced by such factors as the firm's market, the speed at which different products sell, margins, and service considerations. Sometimes merchandising is used to attract customers into the shop rather than to promote the product itself.
