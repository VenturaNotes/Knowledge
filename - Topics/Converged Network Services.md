- CNS involves using many electronic or data services—such as phone, internet, voice, video, or data—over one merged network. Converged network services are used by businesses that want one network provider to take care of all of their communications needs. This can often save money in terms of time, installation, and technical support, while increasing in-house efficiencies and making services easier to repair if something goes wrong.
