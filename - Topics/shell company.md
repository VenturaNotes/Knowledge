- (1) A non-trading company, with or without a stock-exchange listing, used as a vehicle for various company manoeuvres or kept dormant for future use in some other capacity. 
- (2) A company that has ceased to trade and is sold to new owners for a small fee to minimize the cost and trouble of setting up a new company. Some business brokers register such companies with the sole object of selling them to people setting up new businesses. The name and objects of such a company can be changed for a small charge. 
- (3) A name-plate company set up in a tax haven.
## Source[^2]
- A company which does not trade, but has a legal existence, and possibly some non-trading assets. These may include a credit rating, and the right to carry forward losses for tax purposes. For anybody who needs a company to trade through, acquiring a shell company may be cheaper and quicker than registering a new company.
