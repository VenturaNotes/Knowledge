- The average speed of answer (ASA) is a measurement for how quickly calls to a call center are answered. This metric is highly important to call centers, but it has more uses. Businesses or customer service centers are also known to use the ASA. They use this data to determine how successful they are at answering customer questions in a timely manner to increase efficiency.
