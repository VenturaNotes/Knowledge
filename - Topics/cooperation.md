- Agreement by two or more individuals, firms, or governments to work together. Cooperation as a method of coordinating economic activity is contrasted with competition, where individuals, firms, or governments operate independently and sometimes in opposition to each other. All economic systems use some mixture of both mechanisms. Often firms or countries cooperate in some activities, such as research or the setting of industrial standards, while competing in other activities, especially current sales.

- An association between two or more members of the same species (intraspecific cooperation), or between individuals of different species (interspecific cooperation), in which all members benefit. An example of interspecific cooperation is the relationship formed between ants and aphids: the aphids gain protection by living in the ant colonies, while the ants feed on secretions from the aphids. Interspecific cooperation is a looser association than mutualism.
