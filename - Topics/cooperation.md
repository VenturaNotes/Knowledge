- Agreement by two or more individuals, firms, or governments to work together. Cooperation as a method of coordinating economic activity is contrasted with competition, where individuals, firms, or governments operate independently and sometimes in opposition to each other. All economic systems use some mixture of both mechanisms. Often firms or countries cooperate in some activities, such as research or the setting of industrial standards, while competing in other activities, especially current sales.
