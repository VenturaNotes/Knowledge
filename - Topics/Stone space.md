- A compact, Hausdorff, zero-dimensional topological space. Examples include finite discrete spaces and the Cantor set. Such spaces are of interest due to Stone's representation theorem for Boolean algebras. The clopen subsets (see CLOPEN SET) of any topological space form a Boolean algebra$\textemdash$together with union, intersection, complement$\textemdash$and to every Boolean algebra a Stone space can be associated.
