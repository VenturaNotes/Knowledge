- Part of the labour force that belongs to trade unions. Trade unions often negotiate pay, hours of work, and working conditions for their members and aim to obtain better terms from employers than workers could obtain by individual bargaining. Trade unions also represent and assist their members in disputes over discipline, sick leave, or redundancy. Organized labour may also engage in political activities, in particular those aimed at ensuring that the legal and social security systems are arranged for the benefit of workers rather than employers. See also INSIDERS AND OUTSIDERS.
