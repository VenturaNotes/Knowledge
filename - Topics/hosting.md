- The process in which a third party provides both data storage and the appropriate network capabilities to host a network-based service. Specific instances in common use include web-hosting and source-code repository hosting. In particular, there are now many sites that allow users to store and manage their own program code, often for free if the code is made public as open-source software. Currently (2014) the leading open-source hosting sites are GitHub, Source Forge, Google Code, Bitbucket, LaunchPad, and CodePlex.
