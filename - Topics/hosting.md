- The process in which a third party provides both data storage and the appropriate network capabilities to host a network-based service. Specific instances in common use include web-hosting and source-code repository hosting. In particular, there are now many sites that allow users to store and manage their own program code, often for free if the code is made public as open-source software. Currently (2014) the leading open-source hosting sites are GitHub, Source Forge, Google Code, Bitbucket, LaunchPad, and CodePlex.

- (Web Site Hosting, Web Hosting, and Webhosting)
- Hosting, also known as website hosting or web hosting, is an online service that provides both businesses and individuals a platform to store website files and make them accessible to other internet users. Web hosting service providers charge a fee in exchange for space on their web server to store website data, such as images, videos, documents, and HTML files. Web hosts also provide access to tools and services that allow customers to customize and manage their websites as they see fit. In shared hosting services, a website shares server space with other websites, whereas dedicated hosting services do not share server space with other websites. Cloud hosting services are most optimal for growing businesses, as they host a website using multiple servers.
