- Single-instance ERP (enterprise resource planning) is a term used to describe a software system installed on one computer and accessed by multiple users. This type of system contrasts with multi-instance ERP, in which each user has a copy of the software installed on their computer. This term is often used within the context of ERP software, a category of business applications that helps companies manage and integrate all aspects of their operations.
