- Loosely speaking, the power of 10 that can be used to represent a number$\textemdash$so $n$ is the order of magnitude of $k \times 10^{n}$. Different conventions restrict $k$ to the ranges $1/\sqrt{10} \le k \lt \sqrt{10}$ or $0.5 \lt k \le 5$ or $1 \le k \lt 10$, the last being scientific notation
