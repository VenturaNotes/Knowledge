- a first-aid position into which an unconscious but breathing patient can be laid to afford maximum protection to the airway. It involves laying the patient on his or her side, with the uppermost leg bent at the knee and hip and the lower arm behind the back to prevent rolling onto the front or back into a position in which the patient could smother or choke.
