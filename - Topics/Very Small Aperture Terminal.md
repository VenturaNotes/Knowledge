- A very small aperture terminal (VSAT) is a two-way earth station that receives and transmits data, voice, and video signals via a satellite communication network (though not through broadcast television signals). Users of VSAT require a box that connects a computer and outside antenna with a transceiver that sends or receives a signal from a satellite transponder. The transponder sends/receives that signal from an earth station computer.
