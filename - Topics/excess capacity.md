- The part of the output of a plant or process that is not currently being utilized but which, if it could be, would reduce the average cost of production. The excess capacity is thus the amount by which the present output must be increased to reduce the average cost per unit to a minimum.
## Source[^2]
- A situation in which a firm is producing less than the maximum it is capable of producing. A firm may hold excess capacity to meet random fluctuations in demand. Alternatively, the firm may have undertaken in the past fixed investment to meet a higher level of demand than it is currently facing. Excess capacity may also be a strategic choice: investment in capacity signals a credible commitment to raise output if a potential competitor chooses to enter the market. This is an example of strategic entry deterrence.
