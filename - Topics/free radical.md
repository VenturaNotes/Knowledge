## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An atom or group of atoms with an unpaired valence electron. Free radicals are formed when a bond is broken without forming ions. Because of their unpaired electrons, most free radicals are extremely reactive. For example, superoxide free radicals, formed in the body during normal metabolic processes and as a reaction to toxins and infections, have damaging effects on cells and tissues. See also ANTIOXIDANTS; REACTIVE OXYGEN SPECIES; SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE.

- $n$. Any of a number of highly reactive radical (2) molecules having an unpaired electron occupying the outer orbital and therefore being prone to snatch electrons from other molecules in processes such as oxidation, which rusts metals, spoils butter, and injures cells in the body, probably including neurons in the basal ganglia in Parkinson's disease. See also mitochondrial DNA.
