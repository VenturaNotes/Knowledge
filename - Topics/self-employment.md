- Work carried out as a business, rather than as an employee. The self-employed are responsible for their own tax, social security contributions, and insurance, whereas those employed by others can leave these matters to their employer. The self-employed are also responsible for their own health and safety. Income from self-employment is a mixture of rewards for work, returns on private capital employed, and rewards for entrepreneurship.
