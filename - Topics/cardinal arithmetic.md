- Given two (possibly infinite) cardinal numbers $|X|,|Y|$, where $X, Y$ are sets, it is possible to define sums, products, and powers. The sum $|X|+|Y|$ is defined as $|X \cup Y|$, the cardinality of the disjoint union. The product $|X||Y|$ is defined as $|X \times Y|$, the cardinality of the Cartesian product. The power $|X|^{|Y|}$ is defined as the cardinality of the set of functions from $Y$ to $X$. In particular, $2^{|Y|}$ is the cardinality of the power set of $Y$. All these definitions are theorems for finite sets, so it makes sense to extend these definitions to infinite sets. Cantor showed that $2^{|\mathrm{N}|}=|\mathbb{R}|$.
