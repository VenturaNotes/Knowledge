- The termination of an employee's contract of employment by the employer. An employer usually dismisses the employee by giving him or her the required period of notice, but dismissal without notice may be justified in certain circumstances (e.g. for gross misconduct). An employer's failure to renew a fixed-term employment contract also counts as dismissal. An employee having the required length of service in the business can apply to an employment tribunal if he or she is unfairly dismissed (see UNFAIR DISMISSAL). An employee dismissed for redundancy after two years' continuous employment in the business is entitled to a redundancy payment under the Employment Rights Act 1996. An employee dismissed without due notice or before a fixed-term contract expires can also claim damages in the courts for wrongful dismissal.
