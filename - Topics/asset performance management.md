## Source[^2]
- Asset performance management (APM) refers to the collaboration of software and services aimed at optimizing the performance of assets and the effectiveness of operations and maintenance (O&M) across equipment and the business. This is done to improve the availability and reliability of physical assets, decrease operational risks, and minimize costs. By enabling work-process automation, integration, and analytics, APM helps bring increased value to new industrial operations. The functional pillars of APM, which include reliability, health, integrity, strategy and safety, can serve as a comprehensive approach to O&M and asset management. APM can be found as an on-premise software as well as a cloud-based service.
