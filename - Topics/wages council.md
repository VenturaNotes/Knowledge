- A body set up by law to fix minimum wages for particular forms of work. In the UK wages councils operated from 1911 to 1994 in various industries, for example catering and agriculture. Wages councils tended to be set up in industries where wages were low, and collective bargaining was weak or non-existent, possibly because of dispersion of employment and low educational qualification of workers.
