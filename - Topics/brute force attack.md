aliases:
  - brute-force attacks

## Synthesis
- When a hacker tries multiple combinations of usernames and passwords until they find the correct login information
## Source [^1]
- A brute force attack can be stopped by limiting the number of failed login attempts
	- For example, many systems will lock the account after there failed logins

## Source[^2]
- This is when a hacker tries multiple usernames and passwords, often using a computer to test a wide range of combinations, until they find the correct login information
- The name "brute force" comes from attackers using excessively forceful attempts to gain access to user accounts

## Source[^3]
- A method of systematically trying all possibilities to find secret information (eg a password or encryption key).

## Source[^4]
- An attempt to break a code (see CRYPTOGRAPHY) by brute force, by systematically running the decoding algorithm with each possible value of the key until the correct value is found. The possibility of a brute force attack is countered by making the range of possible key values so large that such an approach is not practical.
