- n. (pl. glomeruli) 
- (1) the network of blood capillaries contained within the cuplike end (Bowman's capsule) of a nephron. It is the site of primary filtration of waste products from the blood into the kidney tubule. 
- (2) any other small rounded mass.
## Source[^2]
- (pl. glomeruli) 
- (1) A tangled mass of blood capillaries enclosed by the cup-shaped end (Bowman's capsule) of a kidney tubule (see nephron). Fluid is filtered from these capillaries into the Bowman's capsule and down the nephron (see Glomerular Filtrate). 
- (2) A globular cluster of axons and dendrites found in the olfactory bulb and concerned with relaying signals from the olfactory epithelium (in the nose) to the brain. Each glomerulus receives inputs from numerous olfactory receptors of just one type and combines these signals to send an output via mitral cells to the piriform (olfactory) cortex in the brain.
