- $n$. a lung disease - a form of pneumoconiosis - caused by fibres of asbestos inhaled by those who are exposed to the mineral. The incidence of lung cancer is high in such patients, particularly if they smoke cigarettes (see also MESOTHELIOMA). Asbestosis does not include asbestos-related pleural disease. This is important because patients with asbestosis due to occupational exposure can often claim compensation, whereas this is only rarely possible for those with asbestos-related pleural disease.
