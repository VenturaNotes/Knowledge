- A company in which the members pool their stock and trade on the basis of their joint stock. This differs from the earliest type of company, the merchant corporations or regulated companies of the 14th century, in which members traded with their own stock, subject to the rules of the company. Joint-stock companies originated in the 17th century; they are now rare.
## Source[^2]
- A legal arrangement by which investors pool their funds to carry out a business activity. Investors receive shares in proportion to the funds put in, and the shareholders elect directors to manage the business. Shareholders receive any distributed profits as dividends, proportional to the number of shares they own. Joint-stock companies generally also have limited liability for their shareholders.
