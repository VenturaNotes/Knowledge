- An enterprise nervous system (ENS) is the intelligent network that unifies connectivity across a virtual enterprise. It connects people, applications, systems and devices in different locations and units within that enterprise. An ENS is similar to the human's central nervous system, which gathers information from the body and serves as an internal command center. ENSs have evolved from the traditional enterprise network, elevating the role of a network beyond that of regular communication. Unlike conventional networks, an ENS offloads work from application systems to transform messages, control and track business processes, redirect messages using logical business rules, and enhance quality-of-service for communication.
