- $n$. a solution that produces ions (an ion is an atom or group of atoms that conduct electricity); for example, sodium chloride solution consists of free sodium and free chloride ions. In medical usage electrolyte usually means the ion itself; thus the term serum electrolyte level means the concentration of separate ions (sodium, potassium, chloride, bicarbonate, etc.) in the circulating blood. Concentrations of various electrolyte levels can be altered by many diseases, in which electrolytes are lost from the body (as in vomiting or diarrhoea) or are not excreted and accumulate (as in renal failure). When electrolyte concentrations are severely diminished they can be corrected by administering the appropriate substance by mouth or by intravenous drip. When excess of an electrolyte exists it may be removed by dialysis or by special resins in the intestine, taken by mouth or by enema. See also ANION.
## Source[^2]
- A liquid that conducts electricity as a result of the presence of positive or negative ions. An example is a sodium chloride solution, which consists of free sodium $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$ and chloride $\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$ions. In biology and medicine 'electrolyte' usually refers to the ion itself.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A liquid or gel solution that contains free ions and can therefore conduct electricity, or a chemical compound such as an acid, base, or salt that releases free ions when it is dissolved. The main electrolytes required for human physiology are solutions of the salts of calcium for relaxation of skeletal muscles and contraction of cardiac muscle, potassium for contraction of skeletal muscles and relaxation of cardiac muscle, and sodium for maintaining fluid balance. electrolysis $n$. The process of passing an electrical current through an electrolyte. \[From Greek elektron amber (in which electricity was first observed) + lysis loosening]
