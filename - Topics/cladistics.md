- A method of classification in which animals and plants are placed into taxonomic groups called clades strictly according to their evolutionary relationships. These relationships are deduced on the basis of certain homologous characters$\textemdash$shared derived traits known as synapomorphies that are thought to indicate common ancestry (see MONOPHYLETIC). Implicit in this is the assumption that the ancestral line always splits into two descendant lineages, rather than multiple lineages arising at the same point (the latter case is described as an unresolved phylogeny). Also, it requires that truly homologous characters are distinguished from homoplasic features, i.e. ones resulting from convergent evolution (see homoplasy). A diagram indicating these relationships (called a cladogram) therefore consists of a system of dichotomous branches: each point of branching (called a node) represents divergence from a common ancestor, as shown in the diagram. Thus the species A to F form a clade as they share the common ancestor $X$, and species $A$ to $D$ form a clade of a different taxonomic rank, sharing the ancestor $\mathrm{X}_{2}$. Species C to F do not form a clade, since the latter must include all the descendants of a common ancestor. Compare PHYLOGRAM.
