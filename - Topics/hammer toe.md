- a deformity of a toe, most often the second, caused by fixed flexion of the proximal interphalangeal joint, which produces extension of distal interphalangeal and metatarsophalangeal joints. A corn often forms over the deformity, which may be painful. If severe pain does not respond to strapping or corrective footwear, it may be necessary to perform arthrodesis at the affected joint.
