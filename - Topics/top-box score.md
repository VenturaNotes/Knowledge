- A high score in a scale used in marketing research to estimate purchase intentions. When companies are assessing the intention of potential customers to buy a product or service, they often use a 3-, 4-, 5-, 6-, or 7-point scale representing 'very unlikely to buy' (or some similar statement) to 'very likely to buy'. It is argued that companies should only use those percentages in the highest category ('very likely to buy') to estimate purchase intention.
