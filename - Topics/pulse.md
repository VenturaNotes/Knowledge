- A transient change in voltage, current, or some other normally constant physical parameter. This transient consists of a transition from one level to another, followed, after a fixed time, by an opposite and often equal amplitude transition. The first edge to occur on a pulse is the leading edge, the second transition being the [[trailing edge]].
- For rectangular pulses the transitions should in theory be stepwise, i.e. instantaneous. In reality however they require a finite time in which to occur. For transitions from low to high voltage, current, etc., a convenient measure of this time is the [[rise time]], defined as the time required for the pulse amplitude to rise from $10 \%$ to $90 \%$ of its maximum value (see diagram). The fall time is the time interval between the $10 \%$ point and the $90 \%$ point on the negative-going edge of the pulse.

- The time interval between the leading and trailing edge of a rectangular pulse is called the [[pulse width]]. The [[pulse height]] is the amplitude of a pulse, usually its maximum to minimum voltage, current, etc., ignoring any short-duration spikes or low-amplitude ripple superimposed on the main pulse. See also RINGING.

- $n$. a series of pressure waves within an artery caused by contractions of the left ventricle and corresponding with the heart rate (the number of times the heart beats per minute). It is easily detected on such superficial arteries as the radial artery near the wrist and the carotid artery in the neck (see illustration). The average adult pulse rate at rest is 60-80 per minute, but exercise, injury, illness, and emotion may produce much faster rates.

- (in physiology) A series of waves of dilation that pass along the arteries, caused by pressure of blood pumped from the heart through contractions of the left ventricle. In humans it can be felt easily where arteries pass close to the skin surface, e.g. at the wrist.
