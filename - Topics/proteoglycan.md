- One of a group of glycoproteins found in the matrix of connective tissue. Each consists of numerous carbohydrate chains covalently attached to a core protein; large complexes can form when hundreds of proteoglycans attach noncovalently to a single long polysaccharide, resulting in a fine web in which collagen fibres of the matrix are embedded. See GLYCOSAMINOGLYCAN.
