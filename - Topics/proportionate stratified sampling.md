- A probability sampling method in which different strata in a population are identified and the number of elements drawn from each stratum is proportionate to the relative number of elements in each stratum. For example, if the population consisted of $55 \%$ females and $45 \%$ males, then a sample would be drawn in the same proportions. Compare DISPROPORTIONATE STRATIFIED SAMPLING. See STRATIFIED SAMPLING.
