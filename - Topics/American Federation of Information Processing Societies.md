- Founded in 1961 to provide a structure for professional societies with a primary interest in information processing to join together in order to advance the state of the art. AFIPS was dissolved in 1990. AFIPS is best remembered for its Spring and Fall Joint Computer Conferences at which many important technical developments in the field were first reported. Its role as the US representative in IFIP was taken over jointly by the ACM and the IEEE Computer Society.
