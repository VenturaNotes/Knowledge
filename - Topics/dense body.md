- One of numerous structures found in the fibers of smooth muscle to which the thin filaments are anchored within the muscle cell. Dense bodies are rich in the protein $\alpha$ actinin; some occur within the cytoplasm while others (also called attachment plaques) are attached to the plasma membrane via intermediate filaments of the cytoskeleton. They are functionally analogous to the Z lines of skeletal muscle.
