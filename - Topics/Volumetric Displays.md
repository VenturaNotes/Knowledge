- Volumetric displays are digital recreations of objects in 3D. When viewed on a computer or mobile device, volumetric displays give viewers a 360-degree look at the object and allow them to move the object (or view of the object) around to see all sides and angles. They go above and beyond a simple image or video by viewers to examine a digital recreation instead of only seeing what's been filmed or photographed.
