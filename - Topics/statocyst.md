- (otocyst) A balancing organ found in many invertebrates. It consists of a fluid-filled sac lined with sensory hairs and contains granules of calcium carbonate, sand, etc. (statoliths). As the animal moves the statoliths stimulate different hairs, giving a sense of the position of the body or part of it. The semicircular canals in the ears of vertebrates act on the same principle and have a similar function.
