- (IBRD) A specialized agency established by the Bretton Woods Conference of 1944 to help finance post-war reconstruction and to help raise standards of living in developing countries, by making loans to governments or guaranteeing outside loans. It lends on broadly commercial terms, either for specific projects or for more general social purposes; funds are raised on the international capital markets. The Bank and its affiliates, the International Development Association and the International Finance Corporation, are often known as the World Bank; it is owned by the governments of 189 (2016) countries. Members must also be members of the Bank's sister organization, the International Monetary Fund. The headquarters of the Bank are in Washington, with a European office in Paris and a Tokyo office.

## Source[^2]
- (IBRD) (World Bank) An international body set up in 1946 after the Bretton Woods conference to promote economic recovery and development. The IBRD was originally intended to assist in the reconstruction of countries in Europe and Asia damaged by the Second World War. It has since become a provider of both funds and technical and economic advice for least developed countries (LDCs). The IBRD is funded by quota subscriptions of member countries, partly in gold and national currencies, but mainly in uncalled capital, which is, however, available in case of need to back IBRD guarantees of private loans to LDCs. The IBRD's own loans are only available for public sector or state-guaranteed projects, but it has an affiliate, the International Finance Corporation, which can make and guarantee loans to private sector borrowers. It has another affiliate, the International Development Association, specializing in loans on less stringent terms to the LDCs.
