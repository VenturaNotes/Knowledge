- If a group G acts (see ACTION) on sets X and Y, then a map $f:X \to Y$ is equivariant if $f(g\cdot x) = g\cdot f(x)$ for all $g \in G, x \in X$. For example, if $X$ is the set of triangles in the plane, $Y$ is the set of points in the plane and $G$ is the group of isometries, then the map $f$ taking a triangle to its centroid is equivariant. Compare INVARIANT.
