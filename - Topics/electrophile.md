## Source [^1]
- An ion or molecule that is electron deficient and can accept electrons. Electrophiles are often reducing agents and Lewis acids. They are either positive ions (e.g. $NO_2^+$) or molecules that have a positive charge on a particular atom (e.g. $SO_3$, which has an electron-deficient sulphur atom). In organic reactions they tend to attack negatively charged parts of a molecule. Compare nucleophile.
