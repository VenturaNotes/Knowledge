- The solution of a constrained optimization problem at which one or more constraints are binding. Also referred to as constrained maximum (minimum) when optimization involves maximizing (minimizing) the objective function. Assume $f(x)$ is to be maximized subject to the constraints $g_{\mathrm{i}}(x) \geq 0, i=1, \ldots, m$, where $x=\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$. Then the maximum occurs at a saddle point of the Lagrangian function$$L \equiv f(x)+\Sigma_{i} \lambda_{i} g_{i}(x)$$with $L$ maximized for each $x_{i}$ and minimized for $\lambda_{i}$. The optimum is constrained if, at the saddle point, at least one of the constraints holds as an equality. Examples of constrained optima are the maximization of utility subject to a budget constraint for a consumer who is never satiated, and the minimization of cost subject to a production constraint for a firm employing factors of production with strictly positive prices.
