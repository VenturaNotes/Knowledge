- $n$. A form of learning (1) in which an organism choosing repeatedly between two alternatives $A$ and $B$ is initially rewarded for choosing alternative $A$ rather than $B$ until a behavioral preference for $A$ is established, and is then rewarded for choosing $B$ rather than $A$ until the preference is reversed, and so on. Birds and mammals show progressive improvement in switching from $A$ to $B$ and back again, whereas fish show little or no improvement. Also called reversal learning. See also OVERTRAINING REVERSAL EFFECT, SERIAL LEARNING (2). Compare NON-REVERSAL SHIFT.
