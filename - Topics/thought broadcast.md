- a symptom of psychosis in which the patient feels that his or her thoughts are being distributed into other people's thoughts. It must be differentiated from a mere idea that others can read one's mind, which is common. Thought broadcast requires the conviction of an active transmission of thoughts. This is a Schneiderian first-rank symptom, highly indicative of schizophrenia.
