- n. a genus of spirochaete bacteria, commonly bearing hooked ends. They are not visible with ordinary light microscopy and are best seen using dark-ground microscopy. The parasitic species L. icterohaemorrhagiae is the main causative agent of Weil's disease (see LEPTOSPIROSIS), but many closely related species cause similar symptoms.
