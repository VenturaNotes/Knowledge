- In computer game playing or other search processes, a large search tree has to be explored. It is usual to set a maximum depth limit $(D)$ beyond which it is considered uneconomic to search further. The horizon effect refers to the fact that interesting results will always exist beyond any depth $D$ and therefore in any given search will not be discovered. Variable evaluation functions and dynamic search-depth controls have been used in attempts to deal with this problem.
