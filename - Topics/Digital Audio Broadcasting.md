- Digital audio broadcasting (DAB) is a type of radio network that sends digital signals instead of analog ones. This allows digital audio broadcasting networks to have stronger signal strength and higher quality. DAB also permits text to be sent with radio content, allowing listeners to read about what they are listening to. Future advances in technology may allow for satellite broadcasting. Digital broadcasting is not yet worldwide, but it is operating in 42 countries as of the end of 2021.
