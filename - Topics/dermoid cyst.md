- (dermoid) a benign tumor $\textendash$ a type of teratoma $\textendash$ containing developmentally mature skin complete with hair follicles and sebaceous glands, and often pockets of sebum, blood, fat, bone, nails, teeth, eyes, cartilage, and thyroid tissue, which may give rise to symptoms of thyrotoxicosis. It is usually found at sites marking the fusion of developing sections of the body in the embryo and is the most common benign ovarian tumour in girls and young women. Sometimes a dermoid cyst may develop after an injury. Treatment is complete surgical removal, preferably in one piece and without any spillage of cyst contents. Tumors in the skin are best removed by a plastic surgeon. Because of the risks of surgery and anaesthesia to pregnant women, it is usually considered more feasible to remove bilateral dermoid cysts of the ovaries discovered during pregnancy only if they grow beyond 6 cm in diameter. The procedure is usually performed through laparotomy or very carefully through laparoscopy and should preferably be done in the second trimester.
