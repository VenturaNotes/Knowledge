- (IQ) an index of intellectual development. In childhood and adult life it represents intellectual ability relative to the rest of the population; in children it can also represent rate of development (mental age as a percentage of chronological age). The population's IQ follows almost a normal distribution curve. Most intelligence tests are constructed so that the resulting intelligence quotients in the general population have a mean of about 100 and a standard deviation of about 15. An IQ of below 80 is considered to be indicative of learning disability.
