- $n$. any malignant tumor, including carcinoma, lymphoma, leukaemia, and sarcoma. It arises from the abnormal, purposeless, and uncontrolled division of cells that then invade and destroy the surrounding tissues. Spread of cancer cells (metastasis) may occur via the bloodstream or the lymphatic channels or across body cavities such as the pleural and peritoneal spaces (see TRANSCOELOMIC SPREAD), thus setting up secondary tumors (metastases) at sites distant from the original tumor. Each individual primary tumor has its own pattern of local behavior and spread; for example, bone metastasis is very common in cancers of the breast, bronchus, thyroid, kidney, and prostate but less common in other tumors.
- There are many causative factors, some of which are known; for example, cigarette smoking is associated with lung cancer, radiation with some sarcomas and leukaemia, and several viruses are implicated (see ONCOGENIC). A genetic element is implicated in the development of many cancers. In many cancers a gene called p53 is deleted or impaired: its normal function is to prevent the uncontrolled division of cells (see TUMOR NECROSIS FACTOR). Whatever the initiating cause, cancer always results ultimately from DNA mutations.
- Treatment of cancer depends on the type of tumor, the site of the primary tumor, and the extent of spread. Truth-telling will be important for most cancer patients but is still hard for some clinicians.

- Any disorder of cell growth that results in invasion and destruction of surrounding healthy tissue by abnormal cells. Cancer cells arise from normal cells whose nature is permanently changed. They multiply more rapidly than healthy body cells and do not seem subject to normal control by nerves and hormones. They may spread via the bloodstream or lymphatic system to other parts of the body, where they produce further tissue damage (metastases). Malignant tumor is another name for cancer. A cancer that arises in epithelium is termed a carcinoma; one that arises in connective tissue is called a sarcoma. Leukaemia is cancer of white blood cells; lymphoma is cancer of lymphoid tissue; and myeloma is cancer of plasma cells of the bone marrow. Causative agents (carcinogens) include various chemicals (including those in tobacco smoke), ionizing radiation, silica and asbestos particles, and oncogenic viruses. Hereditary factors and stress may also play a role. A key mechanism is mutation of genes in somatic cells; such mutations can, for example, relax normal controls on cell division, circumvent the orderly removal of cells through apoptosis, or disrupt normal cell signaling pathways. See ONCOGENE; TUMOR-SUPPRESSOR GENE.
