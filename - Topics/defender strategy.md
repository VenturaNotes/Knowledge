## Source [^1]
- A competitive strategy in which a business concentrates on its existing products or services and attempts to protect (rather than expand) its market share by offering superior quality, low prices, and strong customer service. Such a policy requires firm cost control and is usually only successful in an established, stable market where there is little scope for innovation. Compare PROSPECTOR STRATEGY.
