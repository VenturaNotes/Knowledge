- $n$. a decrease in the diameter of blood vessels, especially arteries. This results from circulating vasoconstrictor hormones (e.g. angiotensin I) or activation of the vasomotor centre in the brain, which bring about contraction of the muscular walls of the arteries and hence an increase in blood pressure.
