- $n$. a decrease in the diameter of blood vessels, especially arteries. This results from circulating vasoconstrictor hormones (e.g. angiotensin I) or activation of the vasomotor center in the brain, which bring about contraction of the muscular walls of the arteries and hence an increase in blood pressure.
## Source[^2]
- The reduction in the internal diameter of blood vessels, especially arterioles or capillaries. The constriction of arterioles is accomplished by smooth muscle fibres of the arteriole walls controlled by the action of nerves of the autonomic nervous system, and by certain hormones; it results in an increase in blood pressure.
