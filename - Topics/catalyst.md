- (1) What effect does a catalyst have on the rate of reaction?
	- It increases the rate
- (2) The use of a catalyst changes which of the following?
	- The [[activation energy]]
- (3) Which acts as a negative catalyst
	- Ethanol in oxidation of chloroform
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a substance that alters the rate of a chemical reaction but is itself unchanged at the end of the reaction. The catalysts of biochemical reactions are the enzymes.
## Source[^3]
- A substance that increases the rate of a chemical reaction without itself undergoing any permanent chemical change. The catalyst provides an alternative pathway by which the reaction can proceed, in which the activation energy is lower. It thus increases the rate at which the reaction comes to equilibrium, although it does not alter the position of the equilibrium. Enzymes are the catalysts in biochemical reactions; they are highly specific in the type of reaction they catalyse.
