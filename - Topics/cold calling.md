- A method of selling a product or service in which a sales representative makes calls, door-to-door, by post, by e-mail, or by telephone, to people who have not previously shown any interest in that product or service. In view of the high cost of maintaining a salesforce, many companies direct their sales representatives to those potential customers who are favorably disposed to the supplier (either as an existing customer or by replying to a press advertisement). When companies wish to extend their market to new customers, the sales representative must be willing to call on a large number of people, many of whom will show no interest in the product. The primary objective in cold calling is to establish a favourable relationship quickly, enabling the representative to explain the benefits of their product or service before being dismissed.
