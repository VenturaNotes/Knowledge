- (quibinary code) A seven-bit weighted code, two bits of which are used to indicate whether the encoded number (a decimal digit) is or is not at least 5 in value, the remaining five bits comprising four zeros and a single one whose position is used to determine the number completely. Thus from left to right the weights of the bits are $5,0,4,3,2,1$, and 0 . The weighted sum gives the value of the encoded decimal digit; for example, 3 is represented by
	- 0101000
- and 9 is represented by
	- 1010000
