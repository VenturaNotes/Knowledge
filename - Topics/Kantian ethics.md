- approaches to moral questions based on the thought of the German philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804). These seek to discover what is morally right by asking what basic rules all rational people (see AUTONOMY) could adopt for themselves and then act on as an imperative matter of duty, regardless of their personal desires or of the possible consequences (see DEONTOLOGY; CONSEQUENTIALISM). The Kantian tradition has been influential in medical ethics, especially in its insistence that every human life must be treated as an end in itself and not simply as a means.
