- (FRC) A UK body set up in 1990 to promote high-quality corporate governance and financial reporting. The structure of the FRC and its operating bodies was subject to reform in 2012. There are now two divisions: the Codes and Standards division, which is advised by the Accounting Council, the Actuarial Council, and the Audit and Assurance Council; and the Conduct division, which exercises monitoring, oversight, and disciplinary functions in the accounting, actuarial, and audit professions. See also Accounting Standards Board; Financial Reporting Review Panel.
