- (candidosis) $n$. a common yeast infection of moist areas of the body, usually caused by Candida albicans. It is especially common in the vagina, where it is known as thrush, but is also found in the mouth and skin folds. On the skin, the lesions are bright red with small satellite pustules, while in the mouth candidiasis appears as white patches on the tongue or inside the cheeks. In the vagina it produces itching and sometimes a thick white discharge. Candidiasis may develop in patients receiving broad-spectrum antibiotics as well as in those who are immunocompromised. Topical, intravaginal, or oral therapy with imidazoles is effective; oral nystatin helps to reduce candidal infection of the bowel.
