## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The branch of economic theory that is concerned with the nature of the firm or company, as opposed to the nature of the market. It addresses itself to perhaps four main questions:
	- Why do firms exist at all$\textemdash$i.e. why do markets include organized corporate bodies and not just a myriad of individual transactors?
	- How and why do firms emerge, change over time, and collapse?
	- What determines the boundaries of the firm with the market-i.e. which transactions are performed internally, which externally, and why?
	- What factors determine the internal organization of firms?
- Whereas early neoclassical answers to these questions concentrated largely on the company's role in reducing transaction costs, subsequent approaches have incorporated insights from psychology, sociology, game theory, and the study of agency relationships.
