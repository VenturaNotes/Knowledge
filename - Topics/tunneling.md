- The embedding of a data packet for one network protocol within a different protocol. The enclosing protocol is always a special-purpose tunnelling protocol that understands its contents. Tunnelling can be used, for example, to encrypt packets or to transport them over networks with which they are in some way incompatible. It is an important technique in the implementation of VPNs.
