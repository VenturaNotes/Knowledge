Many corporations operate an intranet because they can tailor the system for their unique needs. Since an intranet has limited users and a firewall, it is often more secure than the internet.

- A network within a single company or other organization that provides access to private information using the familiar tools of the Internet, such as web browsers and e-mail. Only staff within the company or organization can access the intranet, which is usually protected by a password.
