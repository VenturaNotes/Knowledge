- Websites that offer social networking services. Social media platforms became very popular in the 2000s and now have billions of users worldwide. Registered members of these sites are able to designate other members as 'friends', thus creating social networks based on shared interests, etc. The sites offer services that allow friends to communicate easily, for example chat rooms, blogs, instant messaging, and uploading and sharing of images and videos. They also encourage users to post an online profile of themselves, which other users can access, as a means of making new friends. The easy availability of such information and the difficulty of establishing its veracity have caused security and privacy concerns to be raised about social networking websites, especially because many users are young people. See Facebook, LinkedIn, MySpace, Twitter. See also USER-GENERATED CONTENT.
