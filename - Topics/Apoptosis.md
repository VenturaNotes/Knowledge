- In adults, apoptosis is used to rid the body of cells that have been damaged beyond repair.
	- It plays a role in preventing [[cancer]]

- $n$. programmed cell death, which results in the ordered removal of cells and occurs naturally as part of the normal development, maintenance, and renewal of cells, tissues, and organs. During embryonic development, for example, the fingers are 'sculpted' from the embryonic spade-like hand by apoptosis of the cells between them. Defects in apoptosis, for example if it is absent or blocked, have been implicated in the uncontrolled division of malignant cells that occurs in cancer. Abnormal apoptosis, due to failure of the mechanisms that control it, may be a causative factor in autoimmune disease.

- (programmed cell death) The process of cell death that occurs naturally as part of the normal development, maintenance, and renewal of tissues within an organism. During embryonic development it plays a vital role in determining the final size and form of tissues and organs. For example, the fingers are 'sculpted' on the spadelike embryonic hand by apoptosis of the cells between them; the tubules of the embryonic kidney are hollowed out by a similar process. Apoptosis follows an orderly sequence of events, and involves the action of enzymes called caspases. These are cellular proteins that when activated cleave target proteins within the cell, including other 'executioner' enzymes, which digest the cytoskeleton, DNA, and other cell components. Various signals can result in activation of caspases. Internal signals include irreparable damage to the cell's DNA or the release of cytochrome $c$ and other mitochondrial components into the cytosol following damage to mitochondria. External 'death-signal' molecules, e.g. from neighboring cells, activate intracellular signal pathways, such as the Fas signal pathway. The cell shrinks as apoptosis proceeds and components are dismembered, until finally the cell is condensed into fragments called apoptotic bodies. These are degraded by scavenging phagocytic cells. Apoptosis is normally suppressed as long as cells continue to receive extracellular survival signals, in the form of trophic factors-an example being nerve growth factor (see NEUROTROPHIN). In the absence of such signals, the cell embarks on a 'suicide' programme. Sometimes, other cells, for example immune cells, release specific 'murder' signals, which activate apoptosis in target cells (see CYTOTOXIC T CELL; NATURAL KILLER CELL). Cancer is associated with the suppression of apoptosis (see also GROWTH FACTOR), which also occurs when viruses infect cells-in order to inhibit the activity of killer cells. Apoptosis differs from cell necrosis, in which cell death may be stimulated by a toxic substance. Plants also perform apoptosis as a means of removing cells infected by invading fungi or bacteria. Compare ANOIKIS.

- $n$. Programmed cell death, an active process requiring RNA and protein synthesis, that in the nervous system sometimes results from cytotoxic substances or a decrease in nerve growth factor, but that also occurs naturally as part of neuronal pruning during development and growth. See also neural Darwinism. \[From Greek apo off + ptosis a falling, from piptein to fall + -osis indicating a process or state]
