- A monoid is an [[algebraic structures|algebraic structure]] from [[abstract algebra]] that consists of
	- #question What makes a monoid an algebraic structure?
	- A [[set]] M
		- A collection of elements
	- A [[binary operation]] $\cdot$
		- An operation that combines two elements of M and produces another element of M ([[closure property]])
			- #question what is the closure property?
	- [[Associativity]]: 
		- The operation satisfies $(a\cdot b)\cdot c = a \cdot (b \cdot c)$ for all $a, b, c \in M$  
	- An [[identity element]] e: 
		- There exists a specific element $e \in M$ such that $e\cdot a = a \cdot e = a$ 
		- #question What is the identity element?
- A monoid is essentially a [[semigroup]] (a set with an associative binary operation) that also has an [[identity element]]
	- #question What is the difference between a monoid and a semigroup?
- Monoids are not required to have [[inverse|inverses]] for every element, distinguishing them from groups
	- #question What is an inverse? 
### Examples
- Natural numbers under addition
	- Set: $\mathbb{N}$ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
	- Operation: Addition +
	- Identity element: 0 (since 0 + a = a + 0 = a)
- Strings under concatenation
	- Set: All [[string|strings]] over some [[alphabet]]
		- #question What is meant by alphabet here? I think it can be related to Turing machines but not sure
		- #question What is meant by strings here in terms of monoids?
	- Operation: [[Concatenation]]
		- #question What is concatenation and how is it relevant here?
	- Identity element: The [[empty string]] $\epsilon$ (since $\epsilon \cdot s = s \cdot \epsilon = s$)
		- #question what does it mean to be an empty string in this context? 
		- #question is $\epsilon$ always used to represent an empty string?
- Square matrices under multiplication
	- Set: All $n \times n$ matrices over a field
	- Operation: Matrix multiplication
	- Identity element: The [[identity matrix]] I (where $I \cdot A = A \cdot I = A$)
		- #question What is the identity matrix?

### Applications
- Computer Science: Monoids are widely used in theoretical computer science, particularly in [[automata theory]] and [[formal languages]], where strings and concatenation form a monoid
	- #question what is automata theory 
	- #question What is formal languages?
- Programming: [[Functional programming]] often uses monoids for structuring data transformations and aggregations 
	- #question What is functional programming?
	- #question I would like to see some examples of transformations and aggregations that can be applied
- [[Category theory]]: Monoids relate closely to categories with a single object 
	- #question What is category theory?
	- #question What is meant by "categories with a single object?"

- A semigroup that possesses an identity element, $e$. If $S$ is a semigroup on which there is defined a dyadic operation , then$$x^{} e=e^{} x=x$$for all elements $x$ in $S$. Monoids play an important role in various areas of computing, especially in the study of formal languages and parsing.
