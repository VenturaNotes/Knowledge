- $n$. any of the parasitic flatworms belonging to the group Trematoda. Adult flukes, which have suckers for attachment to their host, are parasites of humans, occurring in the liver (liver flukes; see FASCIOLA), lungs (see Paragonimus), gut (see Heterophyes), and blood vessels (blood flukes; see Schistosoma) and often cause serious disease. Eggs, passed out with the host's stools, hatch into larvae called miracidia, which penetrate an intermediate snail host. Miracidia give rise asexually to redia larvae and finally cercariae in the snail's tissues. The released cercariae may enter a second intermediate host (such as a fish or crustacean); form a cyst (metacercaria) on vegetation; or directly penetrate the human skin.
