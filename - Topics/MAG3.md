- mercaptoacetyltriglycine: a tracer used in nuclear medicine, during renography, when labelled with technetium-99m. This agent is cleared by glomerular filtration and tubular secretion by the kidneys. It can be used to measure effective renal plasma flow and to give anatomical information. Compared with a DTPA scan, it can be used in patients with impaired renal function.
