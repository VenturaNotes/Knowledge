- $n$. Recording eye positions and rotations in order to determine directions of gaze and points of fixation (1), usually in a person who is looking at an image or reading text, a research technique pioneered in the 1950s by the Russian psychologist Alfred Lukyanovich Yarbus (1914-86). An instrument designed for eye-tracking is called an eye-tracker. Some use optical devices that do not involve direct contact with the eye, including most commonly video-based systems and, in the case of dual-Purkinje eyetrackers, devices that determine eye movements from Purkinje-Sanson images reflected from the front of the cornea and the back of the crystalline lens; others use special contact lenses with embedded mirrors or electrical field sensors to measure eye rotations directly; and some use electro-oculogram recordings from extra-ocular muscles that control eye movements. There are also portable systems available for eye-tracking during activities such as driving. See also SACCADE.
