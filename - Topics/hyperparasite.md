- A parasite that lives in or on another parasite. The most common examples are insects that lay their eggs inside or near parasitoid larvae, which are themselves parasitizing the tissues of a host, again usually an insect larva. Hyperparasites, more strictly termed hyperparasitoids, are found mainly among the Hymenoptera (wasps, sawflies, etc.), although some flies and beetles also adopt this strategy.
