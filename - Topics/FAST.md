- abbrev. Face Arm Speech Test, or Face Arm Speech Tongue test, quick and easy assessments for paramedics and members of the public designed to maximize the proportion of stroke victims receiving treatment within three hours of the onset of symptoms. Facial weakness is assessed by asking a potential stroke victim to smile and noting any difficulty in smiling without the mouth or eyes dropping; arm weakness by difficulty in raising both arms successfully; speech impairment by difficulty speaking clearly without slurring; and (added later by health practitioners) tongue protrusion difficulty by an inability to stick the tongue out straight from the mouth. Presence of any of these signs is a possible indication of stroke. The test was developed in 1998 by stroke specialists, paramedics, and an emergency room physician in the United Kingdom.
