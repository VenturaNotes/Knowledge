- $n$. A tendency to perceive others as physically more similar to oneself than they actually are. An example from fine art is the work of the Italian painter and sculptor Amedeo Modigliani (1884-1920) who depicted, and therefore presumably perceived, most of his subjects with elongated features resembling his own. See also EGOCENTRISM, FALSE-CONSENSUS EFFECT. \[From Greek autos self + morphe a form or shape]
