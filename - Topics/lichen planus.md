- an extremely itchy skin disease of unknown cause. Shiny flat-topped pink/purple spots may occur anywhere but are characteristically found on the inside of the wrists. It may take the form of a white lacy pattern in the mouth, which usually produces no symptoms. Trauma, such as a scratch, may induce a linear form of the disease (see KOEBNER PHENOMENON). Treatment with potent topical corticosteroids gives symptomatic relief. Tablet treatments may be necessary for generalized disease.
