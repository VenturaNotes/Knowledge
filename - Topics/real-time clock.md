- A clock that runs regardless of whether processes that refer to the clock are running or not. The clock may take two forms, either as a peripheral device that can be read by a process when the process chooses, or as a source of interrupts that occur at precisely determined intervals. A real-time clock measures elapsed time. See also RELATIVE-TIME CLOCK.
