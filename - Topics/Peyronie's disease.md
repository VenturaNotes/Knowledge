- a dense fibrous plaque in the penis, which can be felt in the erectile tissue as an irregular hard lump. The penis curves or angulates at this point on erection and pain often results. The cause is unknown. Up to $30-40 \%$ of men with Peyronie's disease will also have Dupuytren's contracture. The penis can be straightened surgically by means of Nesbit's operation or by incision of the plaque with subsequent grafting. \[F. de la Peyronie (1678-1747), French surgeon]
