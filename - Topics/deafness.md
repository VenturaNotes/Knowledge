- $n$. partial or total loss of hearing in one or both ears, now becoming more commonly called hearing loss. Conductive deafness is due to a defect in the conduction of sound from the external ear to the inner ear. This may be due to perforations of the eardrum, fluid or infection in the middle ear (see GLUE EAR; OTITIS), or disorders of the small bones in the middle ear (ossicles). Sensorineural (or perceptive) deafness may be due to a lesion of the cochlea in the inner ear, the cochlear nerve, or the auditory centres in the brain. It may be present from birth (for example if the mother was affected with German measles during pregnancy). In adults it may be brought on by injury, disease (e.g. Ménière's disease), or prolonged exposure to loud noise; progressive sensorineural deafness (presbyacusis) is common with advancing age. Some forms of deafness have both conductive and sensorineural components, in which case it is called a mixed hearing loss.
- The type of deafness can be diagnosed by various hearing tests (see RinNe's TEST; WeBER's TEST; AUDIOGRAM), and the treatment depends on the cause. See also COCHLEAR IMPLANT; HEARING AID; HEARING THERAPY.

Complete or partial loss of hearing, congenital or acquired, affecting about 10 per cent of adults and more than 50 per cent of people over 65 years old in the UK, the US, and other advanced industrial countries; divided into conductive deafness, sensorineural deafness, and central auditory processing disorder. Also called hearing impairment or hearing loss, especially when there is some residual hearing.
