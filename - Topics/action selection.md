- The [[decision problem]] of choosing between several competing goals, when each has conflicting characteristics, time is limited, and the environment is dynamic. 
	- #question Could you give an example of the above? The above is directly describing what an action potential is, right?
	- #comment 
		- In computer science and mathematics, a decision problem is defined with a yes/no answer such as "Is this [[graph]] connected"
- Action selection, which is a topic in artificial intelligence, may seem to be a technical issue but is in fact a deep and fundamental problem faced by all agents in complex environments. Animals, mobile robots, and software agents must all respond to changing events in their worlds and they must opportunistically decide which goals are best to pursue, and when to interrupt action towards current goals and divert resources to new goals.
	- #question What is a decision problem? Is this a specific term?
	- #question What is meant by "faced by all agents in complex environments"
	- #question What other types of issues are there aside from "technical" issues?
	- #question Could you give an example of a decision problem in this case?
	- #question What is meant by the environment being dynamic? Like a programming environment?
	- #question What do you mean by all "agents in complex environments?"
	- #question Is this a good definition for action selection? I feel like there could be a better more concrete definition (like you were saying with softmax, $\varepsilon$-greedy and winner-take-all methods )
