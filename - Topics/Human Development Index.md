- (HDI) A composite measure of development of a country introduced by the United Nations Development Programme Human Development Report; a combination of the indicators of health (life expectancy at birth), education (mean years of schooling for adults aged 25 and expected years of schooling for children of school age), and living standards (PPP-adjusted gross national product per capita). By construction, the Human Development Index takes values between 0 and 1; in 2014 Norway had the highest (0.944) and Niger the lowest (0.348) HDI of 188 countries.
