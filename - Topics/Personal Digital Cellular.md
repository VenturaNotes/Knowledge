- Personal Digital Cellular (PDC) was a second-generation digital cellular standard used in Japan. It operated in between 800MHz and 1,500MHz frequency bands and had nearly 80 million users at its peak. Third-generation (3G) technologies such as W-CDMA then became the digital cellular standard, replacing PDC in the mid-2000s. Many PDC operators have since terminated their services.
