- $n$. a passage connecting two anatomical channels or sites, thus diverting blood or other fluid (e.g. cerebrospinal fluid) from one to the other. It may occur as a congenital abnormality (as in septal defects of the heart) or be surgically created; for example, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt is created to transfer excess cerebrospinal fluid in hydrocephalus from the ventricles to the peritoneum. See also ANASTOMOSIS.
