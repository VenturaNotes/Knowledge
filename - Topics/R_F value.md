- (in chromatography) Retardation factor: the distance travelled by a given component divided by the distance travelled by the solvent front. For a given system at a known temperature, it is a characteristic of the component and can be used to identify components. For example, the photosynthetic pigments of an organism and the metabolites of a drug excreted in the urine can be identified by their $R_{\mathrm{F}}$ values in thin-layer or paper chromatography.
