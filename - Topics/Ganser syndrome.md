- a syndrome characterized by approximate answers, i.e. the patient gives grossly and absurdly false replies to questions, but the reply shows that the question has been understood. For example, the question "What color is snow?" may elicit the reply "Green". This can be accompanied by odd behavior or episodes of stupor. The condition may be due to conversion disorder or to conscious malingering, especially (historically) in prisoners. \[S. J. M. Ganser (1853-1931), German psychiatrist]
