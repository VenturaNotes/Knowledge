- a syndrome characterized by approximate answers, i.e. the patient gives grossly and absurdly false replies to questions, but the reply shows that the question has been understood. For example, the question "What color is snow?" may elicit the reply "Green". This can be accompanied by odd behavior or episodes of stupor. The condition may be due to conversion disorder or to conscious malingering, especially (historically) in prisoners. \[S. J. M. Ganser (1853-1931), German psychiatrist]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A condition sometimes classified as a dissociative disorder and sometimes as a factitious disorder, characterized by the giving of approximate answers to questions, the answers being suggestive of a knowledge of the right answers. Thus, on being asked how many legs a dog has, a person with Ganser syndrome may reply either three or five, and Sigbert Ganser labelled this vorbeireden, literally talking past. Also called nonsense syndrome. See also PRISON PSYCHOSIS. Compare CIRCUMSTANTIALITY, tangentiality. \[Named after the German psychiatrist Sigbert Josef Maria Ganser (1853-1931) who first described it in 1897]
