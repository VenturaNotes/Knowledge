- Traditionally, businesses would have used in-house hardware to provide certain services. These include firewalls, routers, virtual private networks (VPNs), and other network tools. vCPE replaces the hardware with virtual software-based versions of the same tools. This falls in line with organizations moving to cloud-based storage and other services. vCPE also allows businesses to avoid wasted resources. Hardware that goes unused is a waste of space and business funds. Virtual functions are usually purchased as needed or paid for via flexible subscriptions. This makes vCPE a scalable options for growing businesses.
