- Management that embraces the challenges of managing a workforce that is heterogeneous in terms of culture, ethnicity, religious belief, and political affiliation. The growing diversity of the workforce in most countries today means that many former assumptions about shared attitudes, values, and cultural norms no longer apply. Successful diversity management requires that managers acknowledge cultural differences in the workforce, understand the ways in which these can translate into different work-related attitudes (e.g. in terms of attitudes toward authority or individual competitiveness), and accept this diversity as an asset rather than a liability to the organization.
