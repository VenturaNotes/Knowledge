- In traditional classifications the class of vertebrates comprising the rayfinned fishes (subclass Actinopterygii), which comprise the bulk of living marine and freshwater fish species, and the lobe-finned fishes (subclass Sarcopterygii), which comprise the lungfishes (see DIPNOI) and coelacanths. All have gills covered with a bony operculum, and a layer of thin overlapping bony scales covers the entire body surface. Bony fish have a swim bladder, which acts as a hydrostatic organ enabling the animal to remain suspended in the water at any depth. In the lungfishes this bladder acts as a lung. This traditional class is paraphyletic because it excludes amphibians, reptiles, and mammals, which all share a common ancestor with the bony fishes. Hence, Osteichthyes is now applied to the clade containing the bony fishes and their tetrapod relatives. See also DIPNOI; TELEOSTEI. Compare CHONDRICHTHYES.
