- The New Stone Age: a stage of human cultural and technological evolution that began in the Middle East in approximately 8500 BC. It was characterized by farming using wild and domesticated crops and herding of livestock, and (in the mid- and late Neolithic) by the making of pottery. Grinding and polishing of stone tools was also practised. The Neolithic is thus not a fixed chronological period, and the emergence and duration of Neolithic cultures varied from region to region. Neolithic cultures developed somewhat later in central Europe and in southern and eastern Asia. The Bronze Age superseded Neolithic cultures from around 3500 BC in the Middle East.
