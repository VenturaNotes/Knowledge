- Automatic storage tiering, also known as auto-tiering, is a feature found within storage software management that moves data from one disk type to another or between RAID (redundant array of independent disks) levels. Data storage administrators pre-determine the automatic actions so that the system can carry out these transfers according to the needs of a specific organization. The purpose of automatic storage tiering is to ensure that all space, performance, or cost requirements are met without the data having to be transferred manually, a process that can be time-consuming and labor-intensive.
