- $n$. one of a group of phospholipids that are important constituents of cell membranes and are involved in the metabolism of fat by the liver. An example is phosphatidylcholine. Lecithins are present in the surfactant that occurs in fetal lung tissue. The lecithin-sphingomyelin ratio (LS ratio) is used as a measure of fetal lung maturity; an LS ratio below 2 indicates a higher risk of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS). In such cases cortisone may be given to stimulate fetal lung maturity and hence reduce the risk of RDS in the newborn.
## Source[^2]
- (phosphatidylcholine) A phosphoglyceride (see PHOSPHOLIPID) containing the amino alcohol choline esterified to the phosphate group. It is the most abundant animal phospholipid (being a component of plasma membranes) and also occurs in higher plants, but rarely in microorganisms.
