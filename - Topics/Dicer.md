- A protein, originally identified as the product of the Dicer gene in Drosophila, that trims double-stranded RNA molecules to form short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) or microRNAs (miRNAs). Both siRNAs and miRNAs are produced by eukaryotic cells as a means of suppressing gene activity. See RNA INTERFERENCE.
