- $n$. a muscular organ attached to the floor of the mouth. It consists of a body and a root, which is attached by muscles to the hyoid bone below, the styloid process behind, and the palate above. It is covered by mucous membrane, which is continuous with that of the mouth and pharynx. On the undersurface of the tongue a fold of mucous membrane, the frenulum linguae, connects the midline of the tongue to the floor of the mouth. The surface of the tongue is covered with minute projections (papillae), which give it a furred appearance (see illustration). Taste buds are arranged in grooves around the papillae, particularly the fungiform and circumvallate papillae. The tongue has three main functions. It helps in manipulating food during mastication and swallowing; it is the main organ of taste; and it plays an important role in the production of articulate speech. Anatomical name: glossa.
