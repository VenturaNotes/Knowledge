- $n$. A task in which a person or animal is presented with a series of trials, on each of which the task is to choose a test stimulus that is the same as a sample stimulus, the sample stimulus being presented simultaneously with the test stimulus in simultaneous matching to sample, or some time before the test stimulus in delayed matching to sample. In generalized matching to sample, the several different matching tasks are presented in sequence, and the increase in speed of learning across the series of tasks is measured.
