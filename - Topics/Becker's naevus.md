- (Becker melanosis) an irregularly shaped hyperpigmented patch that contains more hairs than is normal (hypertrichosis). The patch usually appears over half the upper trunk or shoulders in the mid- to late teens, expands over a period of 1-2 years, and persists for life. It is more common in males. No treatment is necessary except for cosmetic reasons. \[W. Becker (1894-1964), US dermatologist]
