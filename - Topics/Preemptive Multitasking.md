- Preemptive multitasking is a computer operation, in which a computer’s operating system has the ability to switch between different computer programs. In preemptive multitasking, a computer operating system uses a set criteria to determine how long to run a specific computer task before letting another computer task make use of its computer resources, such as the computer’s central processing unit (CPU). Preemptive multitasking avoids the risk of a computer program dominating the CPU, which would prevent computer users from running multiple programs at once. The modern versions of WindowsOS and MacOS feature preemptive multitasking. This allows computer users to run multiple programs at the same time without their computer freezing up.
