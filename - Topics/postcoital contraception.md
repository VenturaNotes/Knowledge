- (emergency contraception) prevention of pregnancy after intercourse has taken place. This can be achieved by two methods, which aim to prevent implantation of the fertilized ovum in the uterus: (1) an oral dose of levonorgestrel or ulipristal taken within 72 hours and 120 hours, respectively, of unprotected intercourse; and (2) insertion of an IUCD within five days of unprotected intercourse.
