- $n$. inflammation of the lining of the nose and paranasal sinuses. Rhinosinusitis is a common condition caused by allergies, infection, immune deficiencies, mucociliary transport abnormalities, trauma, drugs, or tumors. Various classifications exist. The European Position Paper on Rhinosinusitis and Nasal Polyps 2012 defined acute rhinosinusitis as lasting up to 12 weeks and chronic rhinosinusitis as lasting 12 or more weeks. Subgroups of the latter include chronic rhinosinusitis with and without nasal polyps and allergic fungal rhinosinusitis. Treatment may require steroids (topical or systemic), antibiotics, immunotherapy, or endoscopic sinus surgery. See RHINITIS; SINUSITIS.
