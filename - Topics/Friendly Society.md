- A UK non-profit-making association registered as such under the Friendly Society Acts (1896-1992). Mutual insurance societies of this kind date back to the 17th century and remained widespread until the introduction of National Insurance in 1946, after which many closed. Those that remain offer a range of personal assurance and insurance benefits relating to sickness, pensions, and unemployment. The 1992 Act created a new framework for Friendly Societies, enabling them to extend their services and to compete with other organizations. Their activities are now regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority.
