- $n$. An unrealistically high expectation sometimes held by juries in criminal trials of the amount and quality of forensic evidence required for conviction, arising from fictional (especially television) portrayals of crime scene investigations and leading to acquittal of defendants who might otherwise have been convicted chiefly on circumstantial evidence. The term was introduced by the US crime reporter Robin Franzen (born 1964) in an article headlined ' "CSI" Effect on Potential Jurors has Some Prosecutors Worried' published in the San Diego Union-Tribune on December 16, 2002. \[Named after the US crime drama series CSI: Crime Scene Investigation, first broadcast in October 2000]
