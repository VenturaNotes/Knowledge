- One of Zeno's paradoxes which relate to the issue of whether time and space are made up of minute indivisible parts. At one of these moments in time, the arrow occupies a well-defined space. It is moving neither to where it is nor to where it is not (because no time elapses in which it can move), so there is no motion during this instant. If time is composed entirely of instants at which no motion can occur, then all motion is impossible.
