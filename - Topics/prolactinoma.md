- $n$. a benign tumor (an adenoma) of the pituitary gland that secretes excessive amounts of prolactin. Symptoms include loss of sexual drive, amenorrhoea or impotence, and sometimes production of breast milk in men and women. If the tumor is large enough it may compress and damage adjacent structures. Treatment is with dopamine receptor agonist drugs, such as bromocriptine, as dopamine inhibits prolactin production and may also shrink and harden the tumor, facilitating later surgical removal.
