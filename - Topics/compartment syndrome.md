- the condition that results from swelling of the muscles in a compartment of a limb, which raises the pressure within the compartment so that the blood supply to the muscle is cut off, causing ischaemia and further swelling. If it persists, the muscles and nerves within the compartment die, leading to Volkmann's contracture (when the forearm is affected). Causes are trauma, damage to blood vessels, reperfusion after ischaemia, and tight casts or bandages. Treatment is to release any tight dressings and to divide the fascia surrounding the compartment to relieve the pressure (see FASCIOTOMY). This should be performed urgently, within six hours from the onset of symptoms, to prevent permanent damage.
