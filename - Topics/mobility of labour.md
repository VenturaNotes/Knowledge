- The extent to which workers are willing to move from one region or country to another (geographical mobility) or to change from one occupation to another (occupational mobility). In horizontal mobility there is no change of status, whereas in vertical mobility there is. An upward change in status will increase a worker's mobility, whereas a downward change will reduce it. The more highly skilled a worker, the less his occupational mobility will be, but he will often be highly geographically mobile. An unskilled worker will often be both occupationally and geographically mobile. In the UK, many government retraining schemes aim to increase occupational mobility; at the same time considerable effort goes into encouraging new industries into areas of high unemployment to reduce the need for geographical mobility.
