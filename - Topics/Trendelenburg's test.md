- (Trendelenburg's sign) a test for detecting dysfunction of the hip joint. Normally when a leg is lifted off the ground, the pelvis on the same side is raised by the hip abductor muscles on the other side. If these muscles cannot raise the pelvis against body weight, the pelvis will tilt downwards and the test is positive, indicating arthritis, paralysis of the muscles due to superior gluteal nerve injury, or other hip pathology (e.g. congenital hip dislocation). \[F. Trendelenburg]
