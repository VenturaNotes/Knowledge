- any of the ducts that convey bile from the liver. Bile is drained from the liver cells by many small ducts into the right and left hepatic ducts, which unite to form the main bile duct of the liver, the common hepatic duct. This joins the cystic duct, which leads from the gall bladder, to form the common bile duct, which drains into the duodenum. The bile ducts collectively are known as the biliary tree.
