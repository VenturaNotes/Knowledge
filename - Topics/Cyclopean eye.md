- $n$. A hypothetical brain structure where the images from both eyes are brought together, believed by the French philosopher Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650) to be the pineal gland, by virtue of its location in the centre of the head, but eventually, in 1959, located by the Canadian-born US neurophysiologist David H(unter) Hubel (1926-2013) and his Swedishborn collaborator Torsten N(ils) Wiesel (born 1924) in the binocular cells of the visual cortex, approximately half the neurons in the primary visual cortex being binocular. See also DISPARITY-SELECTIVE CELL. \[Named by the German physiologist, physicist, and mathematician Hermann Ludwig Ferdinand von Helmholtz (1821-94) after the Cyclops in Greek mythology with an eye in the middle of its forehead]
