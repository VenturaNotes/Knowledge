- Metabolism that is sustained at a relatively high rate. Characteristic of 'warm-blooded' animals (see ENDOTHERM), it generates the heat required to maintain the body temperature of such animals at a constant high level. A tachymetabolic animal typically has a metabolic rate at least five times that of an ectothermic ('cold-blooded') animal of equivalent size. Compare BRADYMETABOLISM.
