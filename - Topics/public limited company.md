- (plc) A company registered under the Companies Act as a public company. Its name must end with the initials 'plc' (or its Welsh equivalent, c.c.c.). It must have a share capital of at least $Â£ 50,000$ or the euro equivalent, of which at least $25 \%$ must be paid up. The company's constitutional documents must comply with the format given in the Companies (Model Articles) Regulation 2008. It may offer shares and securities to the public. The regulation of such companies is stricter than that of private companies. Most public companies are converted from private companies, under the re-registration procedure in the Companies Act.
