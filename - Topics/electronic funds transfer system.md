- Generally, the use of computers in effecting payments between individuals and/or organizations. In some cases the term is used to refer to advanced future systems in which debits and credits are made simultaneously with the transactions that give rise to them. In other cases its use covers all computer-based funds transfer systems, including ATMs (automated teller machines), EFTPOS and debit cards, EFT-EDI (electronic data interchange) systems, and the US automated clearing house (ACH) network. There are several major worldwide EFT networks, including the [[SWIFT]] (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Transmission) network.
