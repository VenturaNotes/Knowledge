- A geological period of the Palaeozoic era following the Ordovician period and extending until the beginning of the Devonian period. It began about 444 million years ago and lasted for about 25 million years. The Silurian was named by Roderick Murchison (1792-1871) after an ancient British tribe that inhabited South Wales, where he observed rocks of this period. The majority of Silurian life was marine but during the later part of the period primitive plants began to make their appearance on land. Trilobites and graptolites became less common, brachiopods were numerous and varied, crinoids became common for the first time, and corals also increased. The only known vertebrates during the Silurian were primitive fish; the first jawed fish appeared later in the period. The Caledonian orogeny (mountain-building period) reached its peak towards the end of the Silurian.
