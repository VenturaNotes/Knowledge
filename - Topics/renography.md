- (isotope renography) $n$. the radiological study of the kidneys by a gamma camera following the intravenous injection of a radioactive tracer, which is concentrated and excreted by the kidneys. The radioactive isotope (usually technetium-99m) emits gamma rays, which are recorded by the camera positioned over the kidneys. A graph of the radioactivity in each kidney over time provides information on its function and rate of drainage. See DMSA; DTPA; MAG3.
