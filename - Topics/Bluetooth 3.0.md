- Bluetooth is a technology that connects devices. This connection allows data to travel wirelessly, without connecting to a Wi-Fi network or other internet access point. Devices arenâ€™t limited to cell phones or tablets. Billboards may have Bluetooth sensors. When someone approaches with a compatible device, the billboard sends a marketing message directly to the device. Bluetooth sensors can also log footfall in retail stores to provide data on shopping habits. Bluetooth 3.0 (BT 3.0) is not the latest version of Bluetooth, as it came out in 2009.
