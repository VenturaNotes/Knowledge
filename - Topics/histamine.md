- $n$. a compound derived from the amino acid histidine. It is found in nearly all tissues of the body, associated mainly with the mast cells. Histamine has pronounced pharmacological activity, causing dilation of blood vessels and contraction of smooth muscle (for example, in the lungs). It is an important mediator of inflammation and is released in large amounts after skin damage (such as that due to animal venoms and toxins), producing a characteristic skin reaction (consisting of flushing, a flare, and a weal). Histamine is also released in anaphylactic reactions and allergic conditions, including asthma, and gives rise to some of the symptoms of these conditions. See also ANAPHYLAXIS; ANTIHISTAMINE.
## Source[^2]
- A substance that is released during allergic reactions, e.g. hay fever. Formed from the amino acid histidine, histamine can occur in various tissues but is concentrated in connective tissue. Histamine is one of the inflammatory mediators released from mast cells in response to antigen binding to IgE antibodies on the surface of the mast cell. It is a shortlived amine that causes the initial symptoms of an allergic response, such as the acute constriction of the airways in an asthmatic attack. It also causes dilation and increased permeability of small blood vessels, which results in such symptoms as localized swelling, itching, sneezing, and runny eyes and nose. The effects of histamine can be countered by the administration of antihistamine drugs.
