- The concept of a single integrated market that underlies trading in the European Union, as codified in the Single European Act 1986, which was introduced in 1987 with a target date of 31 December 1992 for completion. The Single Market came into force on 1 January 1993 with between $90 \%$ and $95 \%$ of the necessary legislation enacted by all member countries. In practice, however, some of its terms have taken considerably longer to implement. The measures covered by the legislation include:
	- the elimination of frontier controls (the full measures have been repeatedly delayed);
	- the acceptance throughout the market of professional qualifications;
	- the acceptance of national standards for product harmonization;
	- open tendering for public supply contracts;
	- the free movement of capital between states;
	- a reduction of state aid for certain industries;
	- the harmonization of VAT and excise duties throughout the market.

- The unified European market created in 1992 by the Single European Act. This was achieved through the removal of all barriers to movements of goods, labor, and capital between member countries of the European Community.
