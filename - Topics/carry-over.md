- The quantity of a commodity that is carried over from one crop to the following one. The price of some commodities, such as grain, coffee, cocoa, and jute, which grow in annual or biannual crops, is determined by the supply and the demand. The supply consists of the quantity produced by the current crop added to the quantity in the hands of producers and traders that is carried over from the previous crop. Thus, in some circumstances the carry-over can strongly influence the market price.
