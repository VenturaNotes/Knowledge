## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A list of the processes that are awaiting the completion of some activity before they can again run on a processor. Typically the activity is associated with input or output, but may in theory be associated with any activity that can cause a process to be suspended while awaiting the freeing of a semaphore (or an equivalent mechanism that may be in use to control process synchronization).
