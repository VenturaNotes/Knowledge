- (artificial ventilation) an emergency procedure for maintaining a flow of air into and out of a patient's lungs when the natural breathing reflexes are absent or insufficient. This may occur after drowning, poisoning, etc., or during a surgical operation on the thorax or abdomen when muscle-relaxing drugs are administered. The simplest and most efficient method is mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. In hospital the breathing cycle is maintained by means of a ventilator.
