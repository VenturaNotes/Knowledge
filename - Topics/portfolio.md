- (1) The set of holdings in securities owned by an investor or institution. In building up an investment portfolio an institution will have its own investment analysts, while an individual may make use of the services of a merchant bank that offers portfolio management. The choice of portfolio will depend on the mix of income and capital growth its owner expects, some investments providing good income prospects while others provide good prospects for capital growth. 
- (2) A list of the loans made by an organization. Banks, for example, attempt to balance their portfolio of loans to limit the risks.
