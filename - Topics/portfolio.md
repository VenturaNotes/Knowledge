- (1) The set of holdings in securities owned by an investor or institution. In building up an investment portfolio an institution will have its own investment analysts, while an individual may make use of the services of a merchant bank that offers portfolio management. The choice of portfolio will depend on the mix of income and capital growth its owner expects, some investments providing good income prospects while others provide good prospects for capital growth. 
- (2) A list of the loans made by an organization. Banks, for example, attempt to balance their portfolio of loans to limit the risks.

- A collection of different assets owned by an individual or a firm. A variety of assets may be preferred to holding a single type of asset for several reasons. Holding a variety of assets can reduce risk, and allows a combination of some assets with higher income but poor liquidity, and others with lower income but more liquidity. Large institutions may also hold a variety of assets because there is not enough of some attractive assets to absorb all their funds or, more likely, if they invested all they could in any one asset their holding would be too large relative to the market to be liquid. See also LOAN PORTFOLIO; PROPERTY PORTFOLIO.
