## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. the unit of the genetic code that determines the synthesis of one particular amino acid. Each codon consists of a section of the DNA molecule, and the order of the codons along the molecule determines the order of amino acids in each protein made in the cell.
## Source[^2]
- A triplet of nucleotides within a molecule of messenger RNA that functions as a unit of genetic coding (the triplet code), usually by specifying a particular amino acid during the synthesis of proteins in a cell (see GENETIC CODE). A few codons specify instructions during this process (see START CODON; STOP CODON). The term codon may also loosely refer to any of the corresponding nucleotide triplets of DNA that are transcribed into codons. See also READING FRAME. Compare ANTICODON.
