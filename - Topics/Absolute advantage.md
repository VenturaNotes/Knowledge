## Source [^1]
- This is the ability of an individual, company, or country to produce a greater quantity of a good or service than another entity using the same amount of resources. This concept is crucial in understanding how different producers can benefit from specialization and trade, as those with absolute advantages can produce certain goods more efficiently, leading to an increase in overall productivity and wealth
- Key Points of Absolute advantage
	- (1) Focuses solely on the productivity differences between producers
		- It doesn't focus on opportunity costs which distinguishes it from [[comparative advantage]]
	- (2) A country with an absolute advantage in the production of a good can produce that good using fewer inputs of labor and resources than another country
	- (3) [[Comparative advantage]] takes into account opportunity cost of production and can explain why countries may still benefit from trade even if they have an absolute disadvantage in all goods
	- (4) Can lead to gains from trades because
		- Countries can specialize in the production of goods in which they have the greatest efficiency and then trade for other goods
	- (5) Helps understand the flows of financial capital because
		- Countries with absolute advantages in certain industries may attract more investment and experience trade surpluses
