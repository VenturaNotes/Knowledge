## Source[^2]
- Lisp (list processing) is the second-oldest programming language in existence that has inspired many other modern programming languages. Lisp ªs program code is written in S-expressions, which are parenthesized lists. This coding syntax (rules that define the structure of a programming language) is quite easy to learn, making it popular amongst new programmers. Lisp is commonly used in the technology industry to program artificial intelligence technologies.
