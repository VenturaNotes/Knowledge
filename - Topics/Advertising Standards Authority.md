- (ASA) An independent body set up and paid for by the advertising industry to ensure that its system of selfregulation works in the public interest. The ASA must have an independent chairman, who appoints individuals to serve on the council, two-thirds of which must be unconnected with the advertising industry. The ASA maintains close links with central and local government, consumer organizations, and trade associations. All advertising must conform to the UK Advertising Codes, which are administered by the ASA; there are separate codes for broadcast media (television and radio commercials) and non-broadcast media (including electronic media and direct marketing). The Codes' requirement that adverts be legal, decent, honest, and truthful applies not only to what is said in an advertisement, but also what is shown. If it is claimed that one bar of chocolate contains one pint of milk, then the chocolate bar must contain that amount of milk. If the advertisement makes no claim, but shows a pint carton of milk, then the chocolate must still contain this amount of milk. The ASA controls the contents of advertisements by continuous monitoring of publications and by dealing with complaints from members of the public (now mainly via its website).
