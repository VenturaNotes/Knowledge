- A digital asset is any digitally stored content that provides value to an organization and is uniquely identifiable. Digital assets include digital media such as documents, audio files, video files, logos, presentation slides, spreadsheets, websites, blogs, GIFs, infographics, PDFs, and images. However, digital media must provide value to be considered an asset. A presentation, for example, isn't a digital asset by default. It must serve a specific purpose like raising funds from investors or informing employees about sales quotas.
