- $IQ = \frac{4\pi A}{p^2}$ where A = area enclosed by the curve, with perimeter P. The circle maximizes the area which can be enclosed by isoperimetric curves, and the IQ gives the proportion of this maximum which is actually enclosed by the curve. IQ is always $\le$ 1, and equality only occurs for the circle.
