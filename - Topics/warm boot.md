- (warm restart) A method of restarting a computer without switching it off and then on again or using an equivalent technique (see COLD BOOT). The implication is that not all parts of the operating system are reinitialized; there is some carry-over from the environment before the reboot. However, a warm boot will normally be quicker and often simpler than a cold boot and may well serve whatever purpose was intended by the restart.
