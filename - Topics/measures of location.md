- Quantities that represent the average or typical value of a random variable (compare MEASURES OF VARIATION). They are either properties of a probability distribution or computed statistics of a sample. Three important measures are the [[mean]], [[median]], and mode.
- The mean of a sample of $n$ observations, denoted by $\bar{x}$, is$$\sum_{i} x_{i} / n$$The mean of a probability distribution, denoted by $\mu$, is$$\sum x p(x)$$for a discrete distribution and$$\int x.f(x) \mathrm{dx}$$for a continuous distribution; it is also called the expectation of $x$, denoted by $E(x).$ 
- A [[weighted mean]] is used when members of a sample are known with different reliability. To each observation $x_{i}$ corresponds a weight $w_{i}$, and now $\bar{x}$ is$$\sum\left(w_{i}, x_{i} / \sum w_{i}\right.$$If each observation is the mean of $w$ observations, the formulas for the weighted and unweighted means agree.

- The median is the value of $x$ exceeded by exactly half the sample or distribution. The median of a distribution is the value for which the cumulative distribution function, $F(x)$.
- The mode is the most commonly occurring value. For distributions in which the frequency function, $f(x)$, has one or more local maxima, each maximum is called a mode.
- These measures may be illustrated on the following sample of eight values of $x$ :$$1,1,1,2,3,3,5,7$$
- The mean is 2.875 , the median is 2.5 , and the mode is 1 .
