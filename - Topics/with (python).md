## Synthesis
- Used for resource management and ensures that resources are properly acquired and released.
	- Used for handling file operations, where it ensures that files are closed after their suite finishes, even if an error occurs
		- #question What are the file operations?
		- #question what is meant by "suite" finishing?
- Simplifies [[Exception handling (python)|Exception handling]] by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks in so-called context managers.
	- #question what is encapsulation?
	- #question what are context managers
	- #question What are the preparation and cleanup tasks in 
- [[Context manager (python)|context manager]] protocol
- Ensures that resources are properly managed by wrapping setup and teardown code within context managers.
	- Leads to cleaner and more readable code especially when dealing with resource management tasks like [[file handling (python)|file handling]], network connections, and locks. 
		- #question What other kinds of tasks can you use with `with` that doesn't involve resource management? 
		- #question How does file handling work in python
		- #question What kind of network connections do we have to work with. Is this basically network programming?
		- #question what are locks in python?
