## Source [^1]
- the part of the basal ganglia in the cerebral hemispheres of the brain consisting of the caudate nucleus and the lentiform nucleus.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A term used confusingly for the caudate nucleus and lenticular nucleus taken together, because of their striped appearance in stained sections, leading to frequent confusion with the striate cortex (to which it is unrelated) and the striatum. It includes the striatum, also called the neostriatum , and the palaeostriatum, usually called the globus pallidus. \[From Latin striatus streaked, from stria a furrow or a flute of a column]
