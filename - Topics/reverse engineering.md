## Source[^2]
- Taking a finished product and analyzing it to find out how it is made or how it works. In the case of a mechanical device, this usually involves disassembling it. In the case of software, it involves decompiling in order to reproduce the original source code. Reverse engineering is most often undertaken with the aim of designing a similar product in a way that does not infringe intellectual property rights. Alternatively, a patent or copyright holder may use it to check a competitor's product for any such infringement. In the EU reverse engineering of computer software is illegal where the purpose is to design a competing product.
