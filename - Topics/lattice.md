- An algebraic structure, such as a Boolean algebra, in which there are two dyadic operations that are both commutative and associative and satisfy the absorption and idempotent laws. The two dyadic operators, denoted by $\land$ and $\vee$, are called the meet and the join respectively.
- An alternative but equivalent view of a lattice is as a set $L$ on which there is a partial ordering defined. Further, every pair of elements has both a greatest lower bound and a least upper bound. The least upper bound of $\{x, y\}$ can be denoted by $x \vee y$ and is referred to as the join of $x$ and $y$. The greatest lower bound can be denoted by $x \wedge y$ and is called the meet of $x$ and $y$. It can then be shown that these operations satisfy the properties mentioned in the earlier definition, since a partial ordering $\leq$ can be introduced by defining$$a \leq b \text { iff } a \vee b=a$$
- Lattices in the form of Boolean algebras play a very important role in much of the theory and mathematical ideas underlying computer science. Lattices are also basic to much of the approximation theory underlying the ideas of denotational semantics.
