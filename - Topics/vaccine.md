- $n$. a special preparation of antigenic material that can be used to stimulate the development of antibodies and thus confer active immunity against a specific disease or number of diseases. Many vaccines are produced by culturing bacteria or viruses under conditions that lead to a loss of their virulence but not of their antigenic nature. Examples of live but attenuated (weakened) organisms in vaccines are those against measles, mumps, and rubella (the MMR vaccine) and tuberculosis. Other vaccines consist of specially treated toxins (toxoids) or dead bacteria that are still antigenic. Precipitated toxoids are used against diphtheria and tetanus; dead organisms are used against cholera and typhoid. Extensive experimental study continues in the search for cancer vaccines, especially against melanoma and prostate cancer. See IMMUNIZATION.
