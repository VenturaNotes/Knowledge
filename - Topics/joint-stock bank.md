- A UK bank that is a public limited company rather than a partnership. During the 19th century many private banks failed; the joint-stock banks became stronger, however, largely as a result of amalgamations and careful investment. In the 20th century, they evolved into the commercial banks or high-street banks.

- A bank operated by a joint-stock company. This is contrasted with a private bank, owned by an individual, family, or partnership. The large commercial or 'high street' banks in the UK are all joint-stock banks.
