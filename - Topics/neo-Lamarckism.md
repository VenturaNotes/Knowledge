## Source [^1]
- Any of the comparatively modern theories of evolution based on Lamarck's theory of the inheritance of acquired characteristics (see Lamarckism). These include the unfounded dogma of Lysenkoism and controversial experiments on the inheritance of acquired immunological tolerance in mice. More recently, some theorists have proposed that certain epigenetic phenomena are consistent with Lamarckian principles. They cite the acquired patterns of chemical modification of DNA and histones that alter gene expression and can be replicated in the offspring. Critics retort that such changes are merely a form of phenotypic plasticity; they do not affect the nucleotide sequence, are not permanent, and can be reversed.

- $n$. A modern version of Lamarckism based on the assumption that genetic changes can be brought about by environmental factors and that natural selection operates on acquired characteristics. See also Lysenkoism. neo-Lamarckian adj.
