- $n$. The crime of driving with excess alcohol in the blood. In the UK and many other jurisdictions, the drink-drive limit is $80 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$ (.$08 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{dl}$ ), often rather misleadingly referred to as .08 per cent blood alcohol concentration. It equates to roughly four units of alcohol (half pints of beer, glasses of wine, or measures of spirits) taken by an average $150~ \mathrm{lb}~(68 \mathrm{~kg})$ person in quick succession, and this is also the figure recommended by the American College of Emergency Physicians (ACEP) as per se evidence of driving while impaired. In some countries, including several members of the European Union, the drink-drive limit is $50 \mathrm{mg} / \mathrm{dl}$, and in Sweden it is 20mg/dl. See also ALCOHOL, BLOOD ALCOHOL CONCENTRATION.
