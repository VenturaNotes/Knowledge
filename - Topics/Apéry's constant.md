- The number $\zeta(3) = \Sigma_1^{\infty}n^{-3}$, where $\zeta$ denotes the zeta function. Exact values of $\zeta(n)$, for even positive $n$, were determined by Euler and are rational multiples of $\pi^n$. But very little is known for odd $n$. In 1978 Roger Ap√©ry showed $\zeta (3)$ to be irrational, but it remains unknown whether the constant is transcendental.
