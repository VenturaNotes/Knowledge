- A quadric whose equation in a suitable coordinate system is $$\frac{x^2}{a^2} + \frac{y^2}{b^2} = \frac{2z}{c}.$$Here the $yz$-plane and the $zx$-plane are planes of symmetry. Sections by planes $z = k$, where $k \ge 0$, are ellipses. Sections by planes parallel to the $yz$-plane and to the $zx$-plane are parabolas. Planes through the $z$-axis cut the paraboloid in parabolas with vertex at the origin.
