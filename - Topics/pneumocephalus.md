- (pneumocele) $n$. the presence of air within the skull, usually resulting from a fracture passing through one of the air sinuses. There may be a leak of cerebrospinal fluid at the site of the fracture, manifested as a watery discharge from the nose. Pneumocephalus can be detected by plain X-rays of the skull, which show air and a fluid level inside a cavity, or by CT and MRI scanning.
