- The City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. This was originated in 1968 by a takeover panel under the auspices of the Bank of England. It lays down a code of conduct for takeovers and mergers; the objective is to ensure that all investors are given equal access to full information and fair advice. The code is not actually law, but bears a similar relation to correct City practice as the Highway Code does to safe driving.
