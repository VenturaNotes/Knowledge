- Loss or injury that has resulted from unforeseen or unusual circumstances. In the law of negligence, a person is presumed to intend the natural consequences of his acts. A person who is negligent will be liable for all the direct and immediate consequences of the negligence. If, however, the consequences of the acts could not be reasonably foreseen or anticipated, the resulting damage is said to be too remote. Similarly, in the law of contract, damage resulting from breach of contract will be deemed too remote unless it arises directly from the breach complained of. No damages will be awarded for damage the courts deem to be too remote.
