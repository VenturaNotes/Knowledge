## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. one of a class of compounds being studied for the treatment of certain cancers. Therapeutic immunotoxins combine monoclonal antibodies, which can specifically target cancerous cells, with a highly toxic compound (such as ricin) that inactivates the cellsâ€™ ribosomes and thus inhibits protein synthesis. Because the toxin does not attack the whole cell only tiny amounts are required.
## Source[^2]
- A therapeutic agent consisting of a monoclonal antibody linked to a toxin or drug. It is used to target, for example, a particular tumor in a patient. The antibody selectively binds to cancer cells expressing the corresponding antigen and is taken into the cell, where the toxin (e.g. ricin A chain) is cleaved, allowing it to kill the cell.
