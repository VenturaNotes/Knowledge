- $n$. one of a class of compounds being studied for the treatment of certain cancers. Therapeutic immunotoxins combine monoclonal antibodies, which can specifically target cancerous cells, with a highly toxic compound (such as ricin) that inactivates the cellsâ€™ ribosomes and thus inhibits protein synthesis. Because the toxin does not attack the whole cell only tiny amounts are required.
