- (1) (in psychoanalysis) a failure of psychological development, in which traumatic events prevent a child from progressing to the next developmental stage. See also PSYCHOSEXUAL DEVELOPMENT. 
- (2) a procedure for the hardening and preservation of tissues or microorganisms to be examined under a microscope. Fixation kills the tissues and ensures that their original shape and structure are retained as closely as possible. It also prepares them for sectioning and staining. The specimens can be immersed in a chemical fixative or subjected to freeze drying.

- (1) The first stage in the preparation of a specimen for microscopical examination, in which the tissue is killed and preserved in as natural a state as possible by immersion in a chemical fixative. The fixative prevents the distortion of cell components by denaturing its constituent protein. Some commonly used fixatives are formaldehyde, ethanol, and Bouin's fluid (for light microscopy), and osmium tetroxide and glutaraldehyde (for electron microscopy). Fixation may also be brought about by heat.

- (1) The act or process of fixating (1). Also called visual fixation. See also Donders' law, eye-tracking, reading span. 
- (2) In psychoanalysis, the persistence of a mode of libidinal satisfaction characteristic of an earlier stage of psychosexual development, as when libido remains attached to a particular instinctual object or an erotogenic zone associated with a pre-genital libidinal stage, such as the oral stage, anal stage, or phallic stage. The concept rests on the insight that people retain throughout life latent attachments to earlier modes of satisfaction and object-relationships, and that these are reactivated by regression (2). Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) referred to it in 1905 in his book Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (Standard Edition, VII, pp. 130-243) and repeatedly in his later writings. See also anal CHARACTER, GENITAL CHARACTER, ORAL CHARACTER, PHALLIC CHARACTER, URETHRAL CHARACTER. 
- (3) The act or process of becoming preoccupied or obsessed with something.
