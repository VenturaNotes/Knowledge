- an anatomical variation in kidney development whereby the lower poles of both kidneys are joined together. This usually causes no trouble but it may be associated with impaired drainage of urine from the kidney by the ureters, which cross in front of the united lower segment. The condition is associated with Turner's syndrome, and there is a small increase in the incidence of nephroblastoma in those with horseshoe kidney.
