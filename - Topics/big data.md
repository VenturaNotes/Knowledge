- Big data refers to extremely large and complex data sets that traditional data processing systems cannot handle. It is characterized by its volume, variety (including structured, unstructured, and semi-structured data), velocity (the speed at which data is generated and processed), and veracity (the quality and accuracy of data). Big data technologies provide the means to collect, process, and analyze large volumes of data from diverse sources to extract useful insights and make data-driven decisions.
