	- Example of solving a [[system of linear equations]] using row operations
	- The notation $2R_1 + R_2  \rightarrow R_1$ indicates
		- Replaces the values in $R_1$ by 
			- multiplying $R_1$ by 2 
			- and adding $R_2$ 
	- Using [[index notation]]
		- $a_{1,1}$:  $2(1) + 3 = 5$
		- $a_{1,2}$: $2(1) - 2 = 0$
		- $a_{1,3}$: $2(5) + 10 = 20$

	- [[Replacement]]: Replace one row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row
	- [[Interchange]]: Interchange (swap) two rows
	- [[Scaling]]: Multiply a row by a non-zero constant
