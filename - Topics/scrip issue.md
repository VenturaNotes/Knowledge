- (bonus issue; capitalization issue; free issue) The issue of new share certificates to existing shareholders to reflect the accumulation of profits in the reserves of a company's balance sheet. The shareholders do not pay for the new shares and appear to be no better off. However, in a 1 for 3 scrip issue, say, the shareholders receive 1 new share for every 3 old shares they own. This automatically reduces the price of the shares by $25 \%$, catering to the preference of shareholders to hold cheaper shares rather than expensive ones; it also encourages them to hope that the price will gradually climb to its former value, which will, of course, make them $25 \%$ better off. In the USA this is known as a stock split.
