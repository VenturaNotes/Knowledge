- The time used as a reference point for comparison of variables such as with indices (see INDEX (in statistics)). An index of 100 is usually taken at the base period and the value at other periods is expressed proportionally, so if prices have risen 17% the index will record 117
## Source[^2]
- The period whose data are identified with the index of 100 (or sometimes 1) for the construction of an index number. In the US, for example, in 2016 Bureau of Economic Analysis data on national income aggregates year 2009 was used as the base period. Base-weighted or Laspeyres index numbers derive their weights from base-period data, whereas current-weighted index (or Paasche index) numbers do not.
