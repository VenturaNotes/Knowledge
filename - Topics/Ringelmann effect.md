- The finding that the output of groups increases as they grow larger but that the gain in productivity becomes less for each new member added. The effect is named after Max Ringelmann (1861-1931), a French agricultural engineer who studied the output of men, animals, and machines in various combinations. It can be explained by the lower levels of efficiency and motivation characteristic of large groups. See COLLECTIVE EFFORT MODEL; SOCIAL LOAFING; SUCKER EFFECT.
