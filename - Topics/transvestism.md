- (cross-dressing) $n$. dressing in clothes normally associated with the opposite sex, which may occur in both heterosexual and homosexual people. Cross-dressing may be practised by transsexuals (see TRANSGENDER), in whom it is not sexually arousing. Other transvestites are fetishistic, and in these cross-dressing is sexually arousing and may lead to masturbatory or other sexual behavior. Treatment may be by behavioral techniques, such as aversion therapy, but is not always needed. See also SEXUAL DEVIATION. $\textemdash$transvestite $n$.
