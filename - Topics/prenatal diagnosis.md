- (antenatal diagnosis) diagnostic procedures carried out on pregnant women in order to detect the presence of genetic or other abnormalities in the developing fetus. Ultrasound scanning (see ULTRASONOGRAPHY) remains the cornerstone of prenatal diagnosis. Other procedures include chromosome and enzyme analysis of fetal cells obtained by amniocentesis or, at an earlier stage of pregnancy, by chorionic villus sampling (CVS). Noninvasive prenatal diagnosis involves a blood test to analyse cell-free fetal DNA in maternal blood. It can be performed during the first trimester and is used for fetal rhesus ( Rh ) determination in Rhnegative mothers, fetal sex determination in pregnancies at risk of sexlinked disorders, and for some single-sex gene disorders (e.g. achondroplasia). Compare PRENATAL SCREENING.
