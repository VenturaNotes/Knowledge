- An annual report on a company's or other organization's activities during the previous financial year, and accounts covering this period. The annual report is normally presented by the chairman at the annual general meeting of shareholders or members, and the accounts are presented by the treasurer. These form a major source of information on companies and other organizations. Copies of the annual report and accounts are usually sent to shareholders and members, either in full or in summary form.
