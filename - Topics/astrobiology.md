- The study of life on other planets. Many disciplines$\textemdash$including astrophysics, biochemistry, microbiology, and geology$\textemdash$are combined in looking for signs of extraterrestrial life in the past or present. The work of astrobiologists provides insights into the possible origin of life on earth, for instance whether living organisms were initially carried to earth from space by meteorites (the panspermia theory). Studies of bacteria that live in extreme conditions on earth (extremophiles) indicate how organisms might live in the harsh conditions elsewhere in space, and survive as spores for very long periods. Astrobiology also contributes to our understanding of the conditions necessary for life and how they might have evolved on earth or on other planets.
