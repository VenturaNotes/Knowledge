- A banking system in which banks hold minimum reserves of cash or highly liquid assets equal to a fixed percentage of their deposit liabilities. The minimum percentage of reserves may be adopted voluntarily as a matter of commercial prudence, or required by law or convention. In either case the intention of minimum reserve requirements is to safeguard the ability of banks to meet their obligations.
