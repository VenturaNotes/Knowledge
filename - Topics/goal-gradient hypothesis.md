This hypothesis was first proposed by the US psychologist Clark L(eonard) Hull (1884-1952) in an article entitled 'The Goal-Gradient Hypothesis and Maze Learning' in the journal Psychological Review in 1932. Experimental evidence subsequently corroborated the hypothesis, among the earliest arising from experiments reported by Hull himself in the Journal of Comparative Psychology in 1943 showing that hungry rats in a maze tend to run faster as they approach a goal box containing food than at the beginning of the path, and there is evidence for the phenomenon in human behavior.
