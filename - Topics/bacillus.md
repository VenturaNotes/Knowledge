- Bacillus n. a large genus of Gram-positive spore-bearing rodlike bacteria. They are widely distributed in soil and air (usually as spores). Most feed on dead organic material and are responsible for food spoilage. The species $B$. anthracis, which is nonmotile, causes anthrax, a disease of farm animals transmissible to humans. B. polymyxa, commonly found in soil, is the source of the polymyxin group of antibiotics. B. subtilis may cause conjunctivitis in humans; it is also a source of the antibiotic bacitracin zinc.
