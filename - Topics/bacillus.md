- Bacillus n. a large genus of Gram-positive spore-bearing rodlike bacteria. They are widely distributed in soil and air (usually as spores). Most feed on dead organic material and are responsible for food spoilage. The species $B$. anthracis, which is nonmotile, causes anthrax, a disease of farm animals transmissible to humans. B. polymyxa, commonly found in soil, is the source of the polymyxin group of antibiotics. B. subtilis may cause conjunctivitis in humans; it is also a source of the antibiotic bacitracin zinc.

- (pl. bacilli) Any rod-shaped bacterium. Generally, bacilli are large, Gram-positive, spore-bearing, and have a tendency to form chains and produce a capsule. Some are motile, bearing flagella. They are ubiquitous in soil and air and many are responsible for food spoilage. The group also includes Bacillus anthracis, which causes anthrax.
