## Synthesis
- An ordered list of everything that might be needed in the product. It's an artifact that evolves as the product and environment change
	- #question What is meant by environment? I understand product might change due to requirements but what does environment mean? Does environment just mean the changes that occur as technology develops?
	- Ordered in this case means by priority. The items at the top are the most important and expected to be worked on sooner. The order is based on business value, risk, dependencies, and effort
		- #question How is business value, risk, dependencies, and effort ranked?
- Initial requirements are part of the product backlog. The initial set of requirements are often expressed as user stories, epics, or features. Most likely the initial requirements will be broken down into smaller pieces over time.
	- #question What is the difference between a user story, epic, and feature
- A product backlog contains items such as 
	- [[User Story|user stories]]
	- [[epic|epics]]
	- [[feature|features]]
	- Bugs/Defects
		- Issues or errors in the existing product that need to be fixed.
			- #question Is this description for bugs or defects?
	- [[Technical Debt]]
	- Knowledge acquisition/Spikes
		- Research or exploratory work needed to gain knowledge or resolve uncertainty before development can begin on a particular feature.
			- #question Is knowledge acquisition / spikes the same thing?
	- Enhancements/improvements
		- Modifications or additions to existing features. 
- Each item in the backlog typically includes a description, estimate of effort, and a value or priority indicator
	- #question Could you give an example of what an item could look like?
	- #question How is effort estimated? Is it based on time until completion? How is that determined?
### Organize
2. **What is inside the product backlog in software engineering? What is typically within this?**  
    - **Knowledge Acquisition/Spikes:** Research or exploratory work needed to gain knowledge or resolve uncertainty before development can begin on a particular feature.
    - **Enhancements/Improvements:** Modifications or additions to existing features.
