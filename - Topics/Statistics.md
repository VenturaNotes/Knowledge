- (1) Numerical data relating to sets of individuals, objects, or phenomena. It is also the science of collecting, summarizing, and interpreting such data. 
- (2) Quantities derived from data in order to summarize the properties of a sample. For example, the mean of a sample is a statistic that is a measure of location, while the standard deviation is a measure of variation.
## Source[^2]
- (1) The branch of mathematics concerned with the collection, analysis, organization, and presentation of information in numerical form. It is based on the assumption that if a group is sufficiently large, it will, unlike an individual, behave in a regular and reproducible manner. For groups that are not large enough for this assumption to be true, a measure of the likelihood of an event happening is its probability. Much of statistics is concerned with calculating and interpreting probabilities. See also DISTRIBUTION; STANDARD DEVIATION. 
- (2) The numbers by which information is expressed. See also Office for National Statistics.
