- A health savings account (HSA) is a savings account in which individuals can contribute to save for qualified medical expenses. Some of these expenses include deductibles, co-pays, medications, and some services that are not covered by traditional health insurance plans. These accounts are tax-free but only available to people with healthcare plans that have higher-than-average out-of-pocket expenses.
