- (swallowing) A reflex action initiated by the presence of food in the pharynx. During deglutition, the soft palate is raised, which prevents food from entering the nasal cavity; the epiglottis closes, which blocks the entrance to the windpipe; and the oesophagus starts to contract (see PERISTALSIS), which ensures that food is conveyed to the stomach.
