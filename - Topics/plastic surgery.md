- a branch of surgery dealing with the reconstruction of deformed or damaged parts of the body. It also includes the replacement of parts of the body that have been lost. If performed simply to improve appearances plastic surgery is called cosmetic surgery (or aesthetic plastic surgery), but most plastic surgery involves the treatment and repair of disfigurement and disability caused by burns, major accidents, and cancer and the correction of congenital defects, such as cleft lip and cleft palate.
