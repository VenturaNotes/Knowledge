## Source[^2]
- paralysis of the facial nerve causing weakness of the muscles of one side of the face and an inability to close the eye. In some patients hearing may be affected so that sounds seem abnormally loud, and a loss of taste sensation may occur. The cause of this condition is usually a viral infection, and recovery normally occurs spontaneously. \[Sir C. Bell (17741842), Scottish physiologist]
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Paralysis of one side of the face caused by inflammation of the facial nerve, often accompanied by hyperacusis on the affected side owing to loss of the nerve's dampening effect on the stapedius muscle. It is temporary in 80 per cent of cases. Compare MÃ¶bius syndrome. \[Named after the Scottish anatomist Sir Charles Bell (1774-1842), who first described it]
