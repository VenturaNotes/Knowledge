## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A hypothesis, first suggested by the economist Nikolai Kondratieff, that the international economy is characterized by 50 -year price cycles. The term has also been used more generally to support the notion that there are 50 -year cycles in economic activity. See BUSINESS CYCLE.
## Source[^2]
- A supposed long cycle in economic activity, with a period of 60 years or more. Economic records in most countries do not go back far enough on a reliable basis to allow this theory to be properly tested. If it is correct, the remarkable spurt of growth in world incomes and trade from 1950 to 1980 may turn out to have been a boom phase in a long cycle.
