- Inability to afford an adequate standard of consumption. What this standard is, once income is sufficient to avoid actual starvation, is subject to much variation between countries and over time. Economists have differed as to whether poverty should be considered in absolute terms, as falling below some fixed minimum consumption level, or whether it should be defined in relative terms, with poverty meaning the inability to afford what average people have. If an absolute standard is accepted, it is at least conceivable that technical progress will eventually lift everybody above the poverty line. If poverty is relative, then poverty will be very difficult to eliminate. See also POVERTY LINE; POVERTY TRAP.
