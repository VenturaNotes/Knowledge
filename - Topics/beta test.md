- A test of a packaged software product in a small number of normal working (as opposed to development) environments. The beta test is usually performed at carefully selected customer sites. A beta test is carried out following acceptance testing at the supplier's site ([[alpha test]]) and immediately prior to general release of the software as a product. It is a confidence-building exercise that also limits the costs of correcting faults revealed when new or upgraded software is first exposed to its normal working environment and workload.

- A beta test, also known as a pre-release test, is the second phase of the software development process in which developers test a software solution with a sample audience. Beta testing comes after alpha testing, which is the initial product testing phase involving unit, component, and system testing. Beta tests allow software platforms to be used for real-world scenarios, helping developers validate their functionality, usability, and reliability. Developers collect and analyze the user experience data to make final changes to the software before releasing it on the market. Typically, beta tests are either facilitated using volunteers or paid subjects.
