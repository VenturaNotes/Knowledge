- Any dicotyledonous flowering plant whose pollen has three apertures (i.e. triaperturate pollen), through one of which the pollen tube emerges during pollination. Eudicots contrast with the so-called 'primitive' dicots, such as the magnolia family, which have uniaperturate pollen (i.e. with a single aperture). The eudicots form a large clade, but their phylogenetic relationships to other dicots and to monocots remain uncertain.
