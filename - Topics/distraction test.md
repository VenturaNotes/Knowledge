- a hearing test used for screening infants between the ages of six and ten months. The infant is placed on its carer's knee, one examiner sits in front of the infant and gains its attention, and a second examiner is situated just behind the infant. At a given moment the first examiner becomes very still and the second examiner makes a sound at the level of the infant's ear to one side or the other. If the infant can hear it turns in the direction of the sound. The sounds made should be of different pitches and a given loudness.
