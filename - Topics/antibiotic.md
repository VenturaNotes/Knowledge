- $n$. a substance, produced by or derived from a microorganism, that destroys or inhibits the growth of other microorganisms. Antibiotics are used to treat infections caused by organisms that are sensitive to them, usually bacteria or fungi. They may alter the normal microbial content of the body (e.g. in the intestine, lungs, bladder) by destroying one or more groups of harmless or beneficial organisms, which may result in infections (such as thrush in women) due to overgrowth of resistant organisms. These side-effects are most likely to occur with broad-spectrum antibiotics (those active against a wide variety of organisms). Resistance may also develop in the microorganisms being treated; for example, through incorrect dosage or overprescription (see also SUPERINFECTION). Antibiotics should not be used to treat minor infections, which will clear up unaided. Some antibiotics may cause allergic reactions. There is now a rising concern that many infectious organisms have developed resistance to the commonly used antibiotics, and that the world is in danger of running out of effective new pharmaceutical agents to take their place. See also AMINOGLYCOSIDES; ANTIFUNGAL; ANTIVIRAL DRUG; CEPHALOSPORIN; PENICILLIN; QUINOLONE; TETRACYCLINES.
