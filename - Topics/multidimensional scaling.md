- $n$. In statistics, a form of statistical data analysis for analyzing similarities and dissimilarities among a collection of elements (organisms, objects, or events) in order to identify and model the dimensional structure underlying the elements, including the number of underlying dimensions, the location of each element on the dimensions, and the nature of the dimensions. The input data are usually represented by a proximity matrix showing the degree of similarity between every pair of elements. Multidimensional scaling has been likened to reconstructing a map of an unknown country from information about the distances between pairs of its towns and cities. See also indscal.
