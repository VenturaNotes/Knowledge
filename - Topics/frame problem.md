- $n$. In artificial intelligence and especially knowledge representation, the problem of specifying formally what is left unchanged when an action is performed. A simple example might involve moving a block from a table on to the floor: this obviously leaves the colour of the block unchanged, and in a formal representation of the action this needs to be made explicit, because some actions do have side-effects, but a difficulty arises from the fact that an infinity of potential changes have to be accounted for. This problem is often solved with the help of some form of non-monotonic reasoning, especially default reasoning.
