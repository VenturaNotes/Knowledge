- A set $S$ (containing a 0 and a 1 ) on which there are defined two dyadic operations that are denoted by + and $\cdot$ and that obey certain properties: the set $S$, regarded as a set with a zero on which the operation + is defined, is a monoid; the set $S$, regarded as a set with a unit on which $\cdot$ is defined, is a monoid; the operation + is commutative; the operation $\cdot$ is distributive over + . A semiring is said to be unitary if the operation $\cdot$ possesses a unit. A semiring is commutative if the operation $\cdot$ is commutative.
- The set of polynomials in $x$ whose coefficients are nonnegative integers constitutes an example of a semiring (which is not a ring), the two operations being addition and multiplication. Other uses of semirings occur in fuzzy logic. See also CLOSED SEMIRING, RING.
