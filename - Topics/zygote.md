- A zygote always has the diploid number of chromosomes
	- Explanation[^2]
		- This is because a zygote is formed by the fusion of two haploid gametes (sperm and egg), each contributing one set of chromosomes, resulting in a cell with two complete sets of chromosomes, which is the definition of diploid
		- A zygote carries genetic information from both parents, making it diploid
