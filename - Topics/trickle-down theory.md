- A claim that accumulation of wealth by the rich eventually results in the improvement of the life quality of the poor. An example of the mechanism through which wealth may trickle down to the poor is borrowing and lending in the capital market: when the capital market is imperfect, as more capital is accumulated in an economy more funds become available to the poor for investment purposes.
