- (niacin) a B vitamin. Nicotinic acid is a derivative of pyridine and is interchangeable with its amide, nicotinamide. Both forms of the vitamin are equally active. Nicotinamide is a component of the coenzymes NAD (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) and NADP, its phosphate. Nicotinic acid is required in the diet, but can also be synthesized from the essential amino acid tryptophan. A deficiency of the vitamin leads to pellagra. Good sources of nicotinic acid are meat, yeast extracts, and pulses. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) depends on the kcal content of the diet and is 6.6 mg niacin equivalent/1000 kcal, which equates to about $17 \mathrm~{mg} /$ day for males and $13 ~\mathrm{mg} /$ day for females. 1 mg niacin equivalent is equal to 1 mg of available nicotinic acid or 60 mg tryptophan.
