- (UNIDO) An international organization that became a specialized agency of the UN in 1986, having developed from the Center for Industrial Development, set up in 1961. With headquarters in Vienna, its aim is to promote the industrialization of developing countries by providing planning policies and technical advice and assistance. UNIDO suffered a major crisis in the mid 1990s, when the USA, Canada, and Australia withdrew from the organization. It has since reformed its structures and processes.
