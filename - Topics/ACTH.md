- (adrenocorticotrophic hormone or adrenocorticotropic hormone; corticotrophin or corticotropin) A hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland that controls secretion of certain hormones (the corticosteroids) by the adrenal glands. Its secretion, controlled by corticotrophin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, occurs in short bursts every few hours and is increased by stress. An analogue of ACTH, tetracosactide, is given by injection to test adrenal function.
