## Source [^1]
- (adrenocorticotrophic hormone or adrenocorticotropic hormone; corticotrophin or corticotropin) A hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland that controls secretion of certain hormones (the corticosteroids) by the adrenal glands. Its secretion, controlled by corticotrophin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus, occurs in short bursts every few hours and is increased by stress. An analogue of ACTH, tetracosactide, is given by injection to test adrenal function.
## Source[^2]
- (adrenocorticotrophic hormone, adrenocorticotrophin, corticotrophin) a hormone synthesized and stored in the anterior pituitary gland, large amounts of which are released in response to any form of stress. Its release is stimulated by corticotrophin-releasing hormone. ACTH controls the secretion of corticosteroid hormones from the adrenal gland. An analogue of ACTH, tetracosactide, is administered by injection to test adrenal function (see SYNACTHEN TESTS).
