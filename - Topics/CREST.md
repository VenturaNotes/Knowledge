- An electronic share settlement system created by the Bank of England for the securities industry that began operation in 1996. Using CREST, shares are registered electronically, purchases and sales are settled instantaneously on the due date, and the dividends can be paid electronically direct to the shareholder's bank. Paper certificates and associated paperwork have been abolished for those who join CREST. As with paper shares, the company register of shareholders provides proof of ownership. Those wishing to retain paper certificates are able to do so. Since September 2002 CREST has been wholly owned by Euroclear.
