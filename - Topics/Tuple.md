## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A tuple is a finite ordered list (sequence) of elements
- An n-tuple is a sequence (ordered list) of $n$ elements, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.
- There is only one 0-tuple, referred to as the empty tuple.
## Source[^2]
- In computer programming, the term ‘tuple’ describes an ordered set of values that store multiple data types. Tuples are unchangeable and are separated by commas. For instance, “(2.0, 3.4, 5.0)” is an example of a 3-tuple containing three numerical objects listed by commas inside the parenthesis. Tuples are used in many common programming languages, such as Lisp and Python.
- Programmers typically use tuples to pass a string of parameters between two programs. In relational databases, the term describes a row of data with related attributes.
