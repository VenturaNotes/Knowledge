- the formation of bone within a muscle, which most commonly occurs after dislocations or severe muscle bruising, especially around the elbow, shoulder, hip, or knee. Initial symptoms of pain, swelling, and tenderness are followed by joint stiffness; if this persists, surgery may be required to remove the bone once it has stopped growing.
