- The probability distribution of a random variable such that its logarithm is normally distributed. This distribution naturally results from the effects of a large number of independent multiplicative sources of variation. It is contrasted with the normal distribution, which results when there are numerous independent additive sources of variation. The log-normal distribution is upward skewed, with a mean larger than its median, whereas a normal distribution is symmetrical about its mean.
