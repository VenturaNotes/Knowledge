## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The risk of a failure in a whole system, such as the clearing-house system in commodity markets. The notion that certain banks or financial institutions are effectively too big to fail is based on the idea that the collapse of such a bank would involve a systemic risk to the financial system as a whole. See SIFIs.
## Source[^2]
- Risk associated with the insufficient stability of a system, such as a market or financial system, caused by the existence of numerous links and interdependencies between the entities in the system, so that the inability of one or a few entities to perform their functions may lead to a cascade of failures of other entities and ultimately result in the collapse of the entire system. This should be distinguished from the systematic risk.
