- The area in which an animal forages and spends most of its time. The size varies according to the size of the animal and its feeding habits; for example, the home range of African hunting dogs may extend over $4000 \mathrm{~km}^{2}$, whereas that of a field mouse may be less than 1 ha. Unlike a territory, the home range is not defended against incursion by other members of the same species, although an animal's territory may lie within its home range. Moreover, the ranges of neighbouring individuals or groups often overlap. Within the range there may be a core area, containing the main feeding and drinking areas, within which the animal's activities are focused.
