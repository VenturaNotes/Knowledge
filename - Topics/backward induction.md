- The process of solving multi-stage decision problems by finding the optimal choice in the final stage conditional on earlier choices, and then working back to the beginning taking one stage at a time. Backward induction can be applied to single-agent finite choice problems. It can also be used to solve for the Nash equilibrium in multistage games. See also CLOSED-LOOP EQUILIBRIUM; OPEN-LOOP EQUILIBRIUM.

## Source[^2]
- The contrapositive form of mathematical induction which shows that if the proposition $P(n)$ fails then the proposition must fail for some $P(k)$, for some $k \leq n-1$. As with the standard form of induction, if $P(1)$ is true, this means that $P(2)$ must also be true and so on.
