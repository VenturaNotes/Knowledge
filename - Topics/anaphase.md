- $n$. the third stage of mitosis and of each division of meiosis. In mitosis and anaphase II of meiosis the chromatids separate, becoming daughter chromosomes, and move apart along the spindle fibers towards opposite ends of the cell. In anaphase I of meiosis the pairs of homologous chromosomes separate from each other. See DISJUNCTION.
## Source[^2]
- One of several stages of cell division. In mitosis the chromatids of each chromosome move apart to opposite ends of the spindle. In the first anaphase of meiosis, the paired homologous chromosomes separate and move to opposite ends; in the second anaphase the chromatids move apart, as in mitosis.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The third phase of cell division by mitosis, when the paired chromosomes move apart to the poles of the spindle, or either of the two phases when this occurs during meiosis (1). \[From Greek ana up + phasis an aspect, from phainein to show]
