- $n$. A statement about something that belongs to one category but is intelligible only of something belonging to another category, as when the mind is referred to as if it were a physical entity. The concept was introduced by the English philosopher Gilbert Ryle (1900-76) on page 17 of his book The Concept of Mind (1949), where he used the example of someone who can see a university library, lecture halls, and other university buildings but wonders where the university is. Ryle described Cartesian dualism as the dogma of 'the ghost in the machine'.
