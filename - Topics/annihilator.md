### (modules)
- Given a subset S of a module M over a commutative ring R, then the annihilator of S is $\operatorname{Ann}_R(S) = \{r \in R: rs = 0 \text{ for all } s \in S\}$. It is an ideal of $R$. 

### (vector spaces)
- Given a subset S of a vector space V, then the annihilator $S^\circ$ is the set of linear functionals $f$ such that $f(S) = \{0\}$. Then $S^{\circ}$ is a subspace of the dual space $V^*$; if $S$ is itself a subspace and $V$ is finite-dimensional, then dimS + dimS$^\circ$ = dimV. The correspondence $S \leftrightarrow S^\circ$ is crucial to duality in projective geometry.
