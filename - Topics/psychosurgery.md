- $n$. surgery on the brain to relieve psychological symptoms. The procedure is irreversible and is therefore reserved for the most severe and intractable of symptoms, particularly severe chronic anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, depression, and untreatable pain. Side-effects can be severe but are less common with modern selective operations. In the UK psychosurgery cannot be performed without the patient's specific informed consent and a second opinion by another psychiatrist. $\textemdash$psychosurgical adj.
