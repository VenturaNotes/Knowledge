- (in genetics) Describing RNA or a single strand of DNA whose base sequence is the same as that required for translation into protein. By convention, the coding strand of duplex DNA is the positive-sense (and nontranscribed) strand, whereas the complementary anticoding strand is the negative-sense (and transcribed) strand. Positivesense single-stranded RNA viruses are the most abundant group of viruses, responsible for many plant diseases as well as the common cold. Their linear RNA genomes are translated directly into viral proteins by the host cell. See VIRUSES (feature).
