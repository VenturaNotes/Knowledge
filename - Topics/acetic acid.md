## Source [^1]
- (ethanoic acid) A carboxylic acid, $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}$, that is used as a carbon source by certain green algae. Combined with coenzyme A (see ACETYL COENZYME A), it plays a crucial role in the energy metabolism of all organisms. Acetic acid bacteria comprise a group of bacteria, e.g. Acetobacter spp., that perform incomplete oxidation of alcohols to yield organic acids as end products. When the initial substrate is ethanol, the product is acetic acid.
