## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (ethanoic acid) A carboxylic acid, $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COOH}$, that is used as a carbon source by certain green algae. Combined with coenzyme A (see ACETYL COENZYME A), it plays a crucial role in the energy metabolism of all organisms. Acetic acid bacteria comprise a group of bacteria, e.g. Acetobacter spp., that perform incomplete oxidation of alcohols to yield organic acids as end products. When the initial substrate is ethanol, the product is acetic acid.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A colorless pungent-tasting liquid that occurs in the fermentation of alcohol, and as a metabolite of acetylcholine and serotonin. It can be diluted with water to form vinegar and is widely used in the manufacture of vinyl acetates, plastics, and pharmaceuticals. See also ACETYL. \[From Latin acetum vinegar]
