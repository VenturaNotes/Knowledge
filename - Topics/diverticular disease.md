- a condition in which there are diverticula (see DIVERTICULUM) in the colon associated with symptoms. Symptoms in uncomplicated disease may include lower abdominal pain (usually leftsided) and altered stool frequency or consistency. The pain is often due to spasm of the muscle of the intestine, but other factors may be involved. The cause of the disease has historically been ascribed to low-fibre diets, but recent evidence challenges this hypothesis.
