- A method of encrypting traffic on wireless networks, specified in the IEEE 802.11 family of protocols. The design of the WEP protocol was found to be faulty, so that the encryption key can be determined by listening to traffic for a few hours on a busy network. The IEEE 802.11i standard includes an improved encryption design; an earlier, but nonstandard, design using similar improvements is referred to as [[Wireless Protected Access]] (WPA).
