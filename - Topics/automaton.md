- A general term for a device that mechanically processes an input string with the aim either of deciding whether it belongs to some set of strings (i.e. to a formal language) or of producing an output string.
- There are two senses in which an automaton A is said to recognize (or accept) a language $L$ : for any input string $w$,
	- (a) A halts and indicates that it accepts or rejects $\mathbf{w}$, corresponding with whether or not $w \in L$;
	- (b) A halts if $w \in L$ and fails to halt otherwise.
- In the case of Turing machines, the languages recognizable in sense (a) and the weaker sense (b) are the recursive sets and the recursively enumerable sets, respectively.
- Turing machines are a particular kind of automaton. Other kinds include the finite-state automaton, pushdown automaton, and linear-bounded automaton. Sequential machines are automata that produce an output string. According to the Church-Turing thesis, if a language is recognizable (in either of the above senses) by any kind of automaton, it is so recognizable by a Turing machine.
