- The lowest price that a commodity stabilization scheme is intended to allow. The simplest way to ensure that price does not fall below this floor is to stand ready to buy the commodity at the floor price: this can succeed only if the stabilizing body has sufficient funds to be able to buy all the supplies on offer. A second method is to take measures to restrict supply when the market price approaches the floor level.
