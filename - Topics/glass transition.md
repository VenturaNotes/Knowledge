- The transition between a glass and a liquid. This transition, which can be reversed, is not a phase transition, as it occurs over a temperature range rather than at a particular temperature. The glass transition has turned out to be a very difficult problem to analyze theoretically. In spite of a great deal of effort over many years it is not well understood.
