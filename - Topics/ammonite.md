- An extinct aquatic mollusc of the class Cephalopoda. Ammonites were abundant in the Mesozoic era (225-65 mya) and are commonly found as fossils in rock strata of that time, being used as index fossils for the Jurassic period. They were characterized by a coiled shell divided into many chambers, which acted as a buoyancy aid. The external suture lines on these shells increased in complexity with the advance of the group.
