- A telephone service provided to businesses by BT in which the business pays for incoming calls. A customer who dials a Freefone number (generally beginning with the prefix 0800 or 0808) from a land line will not have to pay for the call; however, mobile operators now usually charge for access to Freefone. This service is much used by mail-order houses and lines dealing with customer complaints.
