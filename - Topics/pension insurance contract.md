- A pension plan under which the pension scheme uses its funds to pay premiums to an insurance company, rather than invest its funds directly in a particular asset. The insurance company invests these premiums and uses the income from the investment to pay benefits to the pension scheme. An individual member of the pension scheme receives the benefits upon reaching a specified pensionable age.
