- The sale of bank loans by one bank to another. For example, the debt of a developing country may be sold at a discount to the market value in order to reduce the burden of the debt on a particular bank. Loans to individuals may also be sold in this way, from one financial institution to another, often without the borrower knowing that the lender has changed. See also EUROBOND.
