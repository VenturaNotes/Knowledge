- $n$. surgical removal of the larynx in the treatment of laryngeal carcinoma. Postoperatively the patient breathes through a tracheostomy. Speech is lost following the operation but can be restored by teaching the patient to swallow air and then belch it in a controlled fashion. Alternatively, a battery-powered vibrating device can be held in the mouth or underneath the chin to produce speech (see ELECTROLARYNX). Speech can also be facilitated by a one-way valve surgically implanted between the tracheostomy and the upper oesophagus, allowing the patient to divert air into the throat. Partial laryngectomy conserves part of the larynx and allows patients to breathe and speak normally. However, it is only suitable for a few patients with small tumors.
