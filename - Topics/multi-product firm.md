- A firm which makes more than one type of product. In the literal sense most firms produce more than one type of good or service, even if the range is not very wide. Some quite small firms, such as shops, make or trade in a wide variety of products. The term multi-product firm is often reserved for firms which make products which differ significantly in description or construction, especially if they differ sufficiently to come under different categories of the Standard Industrial Classification.
