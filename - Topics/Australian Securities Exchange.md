- An exchange based in Sydney, formed in 2006 from a merger of the Australian Stock Exchange and the Sydney Futures Exchange. The Australian Stock Exchange had itself been formed in 1987, when the Sydney exchange superseded the exchanges in Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart, Melbourne, and Perth. It adopted fully automated trading in October 1997. The most important market index is now the S&P ASX200, covering the top 200 shares on the exchange, although the All-Ordinaries share index, covering some 500 shares, is still quoted.
