## Source [^1]
- adj. Pertaining to a molecule that has one hydrophilic end (attracted to water) and one hydrophobic end (repulsed by water), such as are found in the lipid components of cell membranes and in detergents. See also LIPID BILAYER. \[From Greek amphi both + pathos feeling + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
## Source[^2]
- Describing a molecule that contains both polar (i.e. hydrophilic) and nonpolar (i.e. hydrophobic) parts. Many biomolecules are amphipathic, including glycolipids, phospholipids, and cholesterol. They tend to orientate with their hydrophilic part in an aqueous environment and their hydrophobic part shielded from the water, as in micelles and lipid bilayers, whose properties are a fundamental feature of cell membranes.
