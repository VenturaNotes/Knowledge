- (alliance; strategic partnership) An agreement between two or more firms to engage in an activity on a shared basis. The outside activities of each partner are not affected by the alliance, which is designed to build on the expertise of each member and the way in which they complement each other. Strategic alliances are generally less formal and farranging than joint ventures and may often be designed to last for a limited time. See also CONSORTIUM.
