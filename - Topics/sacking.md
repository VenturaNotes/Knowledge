- Dismissal of labor by an employer. This may be 'for cause', where some form of misconduct by the employee is given as the reason; in some cases employees may have rights to compensation for unfair dismissal if this cannot be substantiated. Dismissal may also be due to redundancy, when the work an employee was hired to perform is no longer required, and the employer has no other suitable job available. In such cases no misconduct on the worker's part is alleged, and such redundant workers may be entitled to compensation. Sacking is distinguished from voluntary quitting of employment, where it is the employee who takes the initiative.
