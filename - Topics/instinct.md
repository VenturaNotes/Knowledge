- (1) a complex pattern of behavior innately determined, which is characteristic of all individuals of the same species. The behavior is released and modified by environmental stimuli, but its pattern is relatively uniform and predetermined. 
- (2) an innate drive that urges the individual towards a particular goal (for example, libido in psychoanalytic psychology).
## Source[^2]
- An innate tendency to behave in a particular way, which does not depend critically on particular learning experiences for its development and therefore is seen in a similar form in all normally reared individuals of the same sex and species. Much instinctive behavior takes the form of fixed action patterns. These are movements that$\textemdash$once started$\textemdash$are performed in a stereotyped way unaffected by external stimuli. For example, a frog's prey-catching tongue flick is performed in the same way whether or not anything is caught. Some complex instinctive behavior, however, requires some learning by the animal before it is perfected. Birdsong, for example, consists of an innate component that is modified and made more complex by the influence of other birds, the habitat, etc.

- $n$. 
- (1) An innate propensity to emit a relatively fixed response to a stimulus. 
- (2) Any natural and apparently innate drive or motivation, such as those associated with sex, hunger, and self-preservation. 
- (3) In psychoanalysis, a dynamic force of biological origin, represented mentally by ideas and images having an emotional charge called cathexis, generating psychological pressure and directing a person towards its aim. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) originally identified it with libido but later (beginning with the publication of his book Beyond the Pleasure Principle in 1920) with both Eros and Thanatos. The German word that Freud used was Trieb, which his translator James Strachey (1887-1967) rendered in English as instinct, but some scholars believe that drive would have been a better choice. Also called instinctual drive or simply drive.
