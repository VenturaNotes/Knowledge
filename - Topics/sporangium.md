- (pl. sporangia) A reproductive structure in plants that produces asexual spores. A megasporangium produces megaspores, which give rise to the female gametophyte; in seed plants it is represented by the ovule. A microsporangium produces microspores, which give rise to the male gametophyte; it is represented in seed plants by the pollen sac. See also SPOROPHYLL.
