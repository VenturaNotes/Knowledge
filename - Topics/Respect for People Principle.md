- Respect for People is one of the two guiding principles that the Lean methodology is built upon.This principle can be broken down into two components: respect and teamwork. The respect component is concerned with respecting others in the workplace and making an effort to understand one another. This requires employees to take responsibility for their actions and trust their colleagues. The teamwork component seeks to stimulate both personal and professional growth. Organizations can do so by sharing opportunities to further develop company processes for the better. This helps maximize both the performance of individual company employees and the entirety of an organizational team. By following the principle of Respect for People, businesses can decrease their employee turnover rate and increase employee productivity.
