- (isonicotinic acid hydrazide, INH) n. a drug used in the treatment of tuberculosis, usually taken by mouth. Because tuberculosis bacteria soon become resistant to isoniazid, it is given in conjunction with other antibiotics. Side-effects include peripheral neuropathy, especially in patients with diabetes or alcohol dependence, which can be countered by including pyridoxine (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{6}$ ) in the preparation.
