- (OI, fragilitas ossium, brittle bone disease) a congenital disorder of connective tissue formation that affects bone, teeth, and soft tissues. It has an estimated incidence of 1 in 20,000 and there are at least eight types, of varying severity, the worst being lethal at birth. Most types are inherited as autosomal dominant characteristics. In all types the bones are brittle and fracture easily; the sclerae may be blue and teeth are often deformed. See also DENTINOGENESIS (IMPERFECTA).
