- (MSH) a peptide hormone produced and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland. In humans it stimulates production and dispersal of melanin in the melanocytes. Alpha-melanocyte-stimulating hormone ($\alpha-\mathrm{MSH})$, which is released by neurons in the hypothalamus, suppresses appetite and regulates energy balance. It also stimulates sexual activity and is involved in regulation of heart rate and blood pressure.
