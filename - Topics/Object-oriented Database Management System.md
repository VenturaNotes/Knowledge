- An object-oriented database management system (OODBMS) is a type of database management system that uses object-orientated programming (OOP)—a computer programming model that categorizes software design around objects that store and reference data in a database. This database management system applies concepts of OOP to the management of 'persistent objects'—objects that continue to exist after the program that created them has been 'unloaded' (where one program process removes itself from another.) An OODMBS has capabilities for security, data recovery, integrity, and removing inefficiencies.
