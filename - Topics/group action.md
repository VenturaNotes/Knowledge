- The group action of a group G on a non-empty set X is a homomorphism $h$ from $G$ to the symmetric group of X. Examples include the group of invertible $n \times m$ real matrices acting on column vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ or a group acting on itself by premultiplication. See also linear action, representation
