- $n$. A rare neurological disorder caused by a defect in the prenatal development of the motor nuclei of the cranial nerves and characterized by loss of control of facial muscles, resulting in an inability to express emotion through facial expression and in most cases a diminished ability to interpret emotion in other people's faces, often associated with oculomotor dysfunction and periodic migraine headache. Also called congenital facial diplegia, congenital oculofacial paralysis, nuclear agenesis. Compare Bell's palsy. \[Named after the German neurologist Paul Julius MÃ¶bius (1853-1907) who first described it in 1884]
