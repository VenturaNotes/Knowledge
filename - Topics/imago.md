## Source[^3]
- n. 
- (1) In psychoanalysis, an idealized image of another person, such as a parent, or of an instinctual object, acquired in infancy and maintained in the unconscious (2) in later life. The concept was introduced in 1911 by Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), who believed that some imagos are derived from archetypes (2) rather than from personal experiences, and it became a key concept of his analytical psychology. In the writings of the British-based Austrian psychoanalyst Melanie Klein (1882-1960), it is a fantastically distorted picture of the real object on which it is based. See also anima, animus (3), idealization. 
- (2) A mature adult insect produced by metamorphosis. \[From Latin imago a likeness, from imitari to copy]
