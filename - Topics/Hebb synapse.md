- $n$. A special type of excitatory synapse (1) that tends to be strengthened whenever the postsynaptic cell fires shortly after the presynaptic cell, even when the firing of the postsynaptic cell occurs in response to an input from a different cell. Such synapses are believed to underlie long-term potentiation in the hippocampus. Also called a Hebbian synapse. See also CELL ASSEMBLY. \[Named after the Canadian psychologist Donald O(lding) Hebb (1904-85) who identified and discussed it in his book The Organization of Behavior (1949)]
