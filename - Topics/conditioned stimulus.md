- $n$. In classical conditioning, a stimulus (1) such as the ticking of a metronome that is initially neutral but that comes to elicit a particular response such as salivation only as a consequence of being paired with an unconditioned stimulus such as food during a process of classical conditioning. It is a slight mistranslation of conditional stimulus, the term originally used by the Russian physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849-1936), meaning a stimulus that elicits a particular response only conditionally (after a process of conditioning). Compare unconditioned stimulus. CS abbrev.
