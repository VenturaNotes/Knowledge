- A situation when countries try to damage each other's trade. The tools of a trade war include tariffs, quota restrictions, or outright bans on imports from the other country, and subsidies or subsidized credit for exports to the other country, or for exports to third countries where the opponent is a rival. During a trade war such methods may be intensified in a series of tit-for-tat reprisals for measures taken by the opponent.
