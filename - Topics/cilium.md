- $n$. (pl. cilia) 
- (1) a hairlike process, large numbers of which are found on certain epithelial cells and on certain (ciliate) protozoa. Cilia are particularly characteristic of the epithelium that lines the upper respiratory tract, where their beating serves to remove particles of dust and other foreign material. 
- (2) an eyelash or eyelid. -ciliary adj.
## Source[^2]
- (pl. cilia) A short minute hairlike structure (up to $10 ~\mu \mathrm{m}$ long) present on the surface of many cells, notably in certain protozoans and some types of vertebrate epithelium. Cilia usually occur in large groups and are shorter than eukaryotic flagella, although both organelles have the same structure (see flagellum). Beating of cilia can produce cell movement or create a current in fluid surrounding a cell. See also AXONEME.
