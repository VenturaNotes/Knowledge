- $n$. trade name for a nickel-titanium alloy prostatic stent used as a minimally invasive treatment for men with lower urinary tract symptoms due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (see PROSTATE GLAND) who are unfit for surgery. The stent is placed in the prostatic section of the urethra and bladder neck using a flexible cystoscope. The stent expands when warm water is passed through it; cold water causes contraction and allows removal. Less commonly this stent can be used in the ureter in the management of ureteric strictures.
