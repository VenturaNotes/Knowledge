- $n$. a jerky involuntary movement particularly affecting the head, face, or limbs. Each movement is sudden but the resulting posture may be prolonged for a few seconds. The symptoms are usually due to disease of the basal ganglia but may result from drug therapy for parkinsonism or phenothiazines. Such movements are characteristic of Huntington's disease, in which they are associated with progressive dementia. See also SYDENHAM's CHOREA.
