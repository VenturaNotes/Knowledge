- Phase-shift keying (PSK) happens when data is transmitted by changing wave frequency . A finite number of changes are used in PSK, making the frequency changes trackable and understandable for those receiving the data. Where one method of data transmission will rely on the same frequency, PSK uses a set number of changes in frequency to communicate even more information, which can be useful to discreetly transmit data.
