- $n$. absence of the sense of smell. This can be temporary, as with a cold or other forms of rhinitis, or it can be permanent, following certain viral infections, head injuries, and tumors affecting the olfactory nerve. If loss of the sense of smell is partial rather than total, the condition is called hyposmia.
