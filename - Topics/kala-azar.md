- (visceral leishmaniasis, Dumdum fever) n. a tropical disease caused by the parasitic protozoan Leishmania donovani. The parasite, which is transmitted to humans by sandflies, invades the cells of the lymphatic system, spleen, and bone marrow. Symptoms include enlargement and subsequent lesions of the liver and spleen; anaemia; a low leucocyte count; weight loss; and irregular fevers. The disease occurs in Asia, South America, the Mediterranean area, and Africa. Drugs containing antimony, with supplementary pentamidine, are used in the treatment of this potentially fatal disease.
