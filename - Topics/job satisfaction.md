- The sense of fulfilment and pride felt by people who enjoy their work and do it well. This feeling is enhanced if the significance of the work done and its value are recognized by those in authority (see EMPOWERMENT; MOTIVATION; SELF-ACTUALIZATION).
- The factors that determine job satisfaction are investigated by industrial and organizational psychology because it is widely accepted that a satisfied workforce is more productive and compliant than a dissatisfied force. The general conclusion is that to motivate and reassure employees, managers should encourage the sense of community felt by everyone in a successful organization, in addition to broadening their jobs (see JOB ENLARGEMENT; JOB ENRICHMENT) and praising their work.
- An absence of job satisfaction has been blamed for absenteeism, accident proneness, high labor turnover rates, poor industrial relations, and a demotivated workforce that produces shoddy work (see ALIENATION).
- Organizational psychologists have shown that apart from the human needs fulfilled by working, satisfaction is also related to the expectations aroused by the job: both the needs and the expectations require fulfilment if the job is to provide satisfaction. See also HYGIENE FACTORS; MOTIVATORS.

- $n$. In personnel psychology and industrial/organizational psychology or occupational psychology, the degree to which employees are contented with their jobs. It tends to be low when experience in a job fails to live up to expectations, although the same work might produce higher levels of job satisfaction among employees with more realistic expectations. Low job satisfaction leads to high absenteeism and labor turnover, but the relationship between job satisfaction and productivity is not straightforward. See also Job Descriptive Index.
