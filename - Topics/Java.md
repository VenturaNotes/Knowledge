```Java
for(int i=10; i>=0; i--) 
{
	System.out.print(i + ",");
}
//Output: 10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3,2,1,0,%

## Source[^2]
- Java A language for object-oriented programming, especially applicable to the World Wide Web; it was developed from 1990 at Sun Microsystems by P. Naughton. In 2006-07 Sun released its Java source code as open-source software. The output produced by a Java compiler is not executable code but an intermediate code, known as bytecode, that is designed to translate directly into native machine code for high performance. Bytecode can thus be interpreted on any computer on which the Java run-time system is installed, allowing cross-platform portability (see PLATFORM, PORTABLE). Allegedly, full security is provided as no Java program can break out of this run-time environment or access unprotected system resources. Java is optimized for small networked applications that are dynamically downloaded across the Internet. These small programs, known as [[applet|applets]], can react to user input.

- Java is an object-oriented programming language first developed in 1995. It is one of the most popular programming languages and has inspired the development of many others over the years, including C#. Despite all of the languages in existence, developers still prefer Java for projects like Android development, big data, desktop computing, and games. Java is still in use today, with the latest version, Java 17, released in 2021 and Java 18 slated for release in 2022.

- A programming language and associated software platform that enable complex and graphical customer applications to be written and then accessed from a web browser. An example might be a form for calculating interest on a loan.
