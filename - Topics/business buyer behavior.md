- (industrial buyer behavior) The shaping of business decisions by the purchaser of raw materials, components, industrial equipment, and services for an organization. The amount of time devoted to the process will depend on a number of factors, including the importance of the decision, the cost to the organization of the decision, the alternative products or services available, and the purchasing officer's experience. Three situations are recognized:
	- straight rebuy-a familiar product (e.g. stationery, electricity) is bought from a regular supplier;
	- modified rebuy-looking around for a product with improved performance, perhaps reflecting dissatisfaction with current suppliers;
	- new-task buying-the buyer, on behalf of the organization, is attempting to fulfil a need or solve a problem that has not been previously encountered.
- The higher the risk factor involved in a purchase (e.g. new production equipment, an innovative robotic machine), the larger will be the team forming the decision-making unit (DMU) involved.
