- For any system at equilibrium, the relationship P + F = C + 2 holds, where P is the number of distinct phases, C the number of components, and F the number of degrees of freedom of the system. The relationship, derived by Josiah Willard Gibbs in 1876 using thermodynamics, is often called the Gibbs phase rule.
