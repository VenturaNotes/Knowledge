## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- a process in which a drug administered by mouth is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and transported via the portal vein to the liver, where it is metabolized. As a result, in some cases only a small proportion of the active drug reaches the systemic circulation and its intended target tissue. First-pass metabolism can be bypassed by giving the drug via sublingual or buccal routes.
