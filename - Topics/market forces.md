- The forces of supply and demand that in a free market determine the quantity available of a particular product or service and the price at which it is offered. In general, a rise in demand will cause both supply and price to increase, while a rise in supply will cause both a fall in price and a drop in demand, although many markets have individual features that modify this simple analysis.
