- The forces of supply and demand that in a free market determine the quantity available of a particular product or service and the price at which it is offered. In general, a rise in demand will cause both supply and price to increase, while a rise in supply will cause both a fall in price and a drop in demand, although many markets have individual features that modify this simple analysis.
## Source[^2]
- The forces of supply and demand, that determine equilibrium quantities and prices in markets. These are contrasted with the government and monetary authorities, which are able to some extent to influence market forces. In some matters government powers are considerable, but in others the authorities have little power: for example, the total turnover of the foreign exchange markets is so large compared to the foreign exchange reserves of most countries that exchange rates can only diverge very little from what market forces dictate.
