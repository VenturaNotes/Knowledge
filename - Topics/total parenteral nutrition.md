- (TPN) the delivery of all the essential nutrients directly into the bloodstream through a catheter in a vein. This may be by the peripheral route, via a vein in the upper arm (see PICC LINE) for short-term use (see PERIPHERAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION), or centrally, into the subclavian vein in the neck (see HickMAN CATHETER), for longer than two weeks. TPN has a risk of complications and should only be used when the gastrointestinal tract is not functioning. Enteral feeding is always the preferred route. See also ARTIFICIAL NUTRITION AND HYDRATION; NUTRITION.
