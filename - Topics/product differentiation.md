## Source [^1]
- The creation of a distinction between products that fulfil the same purpose but are made by different producers and therefore compete with each other. The distinction may be real (i.e. one product is better than others) or largely illusory. Producers in a competitive market use packaging, advertising, etc., to enhance the idea that significant differences exist where none in fact do. See also MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION.
