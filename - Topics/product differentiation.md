## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The creation of a distinction between products that fulfil the same purpose but are made by different producers and therefore compete with each other. The distinction may be real (i.e. one product is better than others) or largely illusory. Producers in a competitive market use packaging, advertising, etc., to enhance the idea that significant differences exist where none in fact do. See also MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION.
## Source[^2]
- A form of non-price competition between firms under which products that fulfil the same needs but are not necessarily identical are offered under different brand names. Differentiated products can also be produced within the same firm and targeted to different groups of consumers. The differentiation is vertical if the products can be ordered according to their quality (low to high). The differentiation is horizontal if the feature along which the products differ does not allow ordering, such as different colours.
