- (roundworm) $n$. any one of a large group of worms having an unsegmented cylindrical body, tapering at both ends. This distinguishes nematodes from other helminths. Nematodes occur either as free-living forms in the sea, fresh water, and soil or as parasites of plants, animals, and humans. Hookworms and threadworms infest the alimentary canal. Filariae are found in the lymphatic tissues. The guinea worm and Onchocerca affect connective tissue. Some nematodes (e.g. threadworms) are transmitted from host to host by the ingestion of eggs; others (e.g. Wuchereria) by the bite of a bloodsucking insect.
