- A bot, short for robot, is a software application that automates repetitive tasks and aims to imitate or replace the activity human beings perform. Since bots are automated programs, they can perform tasks faster than humans. While some bots help humans by completing repetitive tasks for them, others are malicious and operate as a form of malware. Bots typically operate over a computer network, communicating with each other using internet-based services such as instant messaging on social apps. Bots are powered by algorithmic sets that help facilitate the various tasks they are programmed to complete, such as mimicking human behaviors. There are various types of internet bots including shopping bots, monitoring bots, chatbots, social bots, transactional bots, web crawling bots, knowbots, and web scraping bots.

Bots can also be used for malicious purposes: a botnet is a collection of computers compromised by bots controlled by the same intruder.
