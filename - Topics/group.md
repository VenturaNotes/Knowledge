- An operation on a set is worth considering only if it has properties likely to lead to interesting and useful results. Certain basic properties recur in different parts of mathematics and, if these are recognized, use can be made of the similarities that exist in the different situations. One such set of basic properties is specified in the definition of a group. The following, then, are all examples of groups: the set of real numbers with addition, the set of non-zero real numbers with multiplication, the set of $2 \times 2$ real matrices with matrix addition, the set of vectors in 3-dimensional space with vector addition, the set of all bijections from a set S onto itself with composition, the four numbers $1, i, -1, -i$ with multiplication. The definition is as follows: a group is a set G closed under an operation $\circ$ such that
	- (i) for all $a, b$ and $c$ in G, $a \circ (b \circ c) = (a \circ b) \circ c$
	- (ii) there is an identity element $e$ in G such that $a \circ e = e \circ a = a$ for all $a$ in $G$
	- (iii) for each $a$ in $G$, there is an inverse element $a'$ in $G$ such that $a \circ a' = a' \circ a = e$.
- The group may be denoted by $(G, \circ)$, when it is necessary to specify the operation, but it may be called simply the group G when the intended operation is clear.

- A set $G$ on which there is defined a dyadic operation ${ }^{\circ}$ (mapping $G \times G$ into $G$ ) that satisfies the following properties:

(a) ${ }^{\circ}$ is associative;

(b) ${ }^{\circ}$ has an identity, i.e. there is a unique element $e$ in $G$ with the property that

  

$$

x^{\circ} e=e^{\circ} x=x

$$

  

for all $x$ in $G ; e$ is called the identity of the group;

(c) inverses exist in $G$, i.e. for each $x$ in $G$ there is an inverse, denoted by $x^{-1}$, with the property that

  

$$

x^{\circ} x^{-1}=x^{-1} \circ x=e

$$

  

These are the group axioms.

Certain kinds of groups are of particular interest. If the dyadic operation ${ }^{\circ}$ is commutative, the group is said to be a commutative group or an [[Commutative group|Abelian group]] (named for the Norwegian mathematician Niels Abel).

  

If there is only a finite number of elements $n$ in the group, the group is said to be finite; $n$ is then the order of the group. Finite groups can be represented or depicted by means of a Cayley table.

  

If the group has a generator then it is said to be cyclic; a cyclic group must be abelian.

The group is a very important algebraic structure that underlies many other algebraic structures such as rings and fields. There are direct applications of groups in the study of symmetry, in the study of transformations and in particular permutations, and also in error detecting and error correcting as well as in the design of fast adders.

  

Groups were originally introduced for solving an algebraic problem. By group theory it can be shown that algorithmic methods of a particular kind cannot exist for finding the roots of a general polynomial of degree greater than four. See also SEMIGROUP.

- A parent undertaking and its subsidiary or subsidiaries. In UK tax law, two or more companies constitute a group where one company holds more than $50 \%$ of the shares in the other(s). This test is usually applied to the voting share capital only. Where there is a group of companies, the availability of the lower rates of corporation tax is restricted. Where the links between companies are made by share ownership of $75 \%$ or over, assets can be passed among the companies without a tax charge in respect of capital gains.
