- An infinite sequence of vectors $\{v_n\}$ in a Banach space such that every $v$ $\upvarepsilon V$ can be written uniquely as $v=\sum_1^{\infty}a_nv_n$ for scalars $a_n$. Every Banach space with a Schauder basis is necessarily separable, but the converse does not hold. Compare BAIRE CATEGORY THEOREM, COMPLETE ORTHONORMAL BASIS, HAMEL BASIS.
