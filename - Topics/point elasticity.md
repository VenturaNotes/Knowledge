- The ratio of a proportional change in one variable to that of another, measured at a point. For example, if $p$ is price and $q$ is quantity, the price elasticity of demand, $\varepsilon_{d}$, is defined as $\varepsilon_{d}=(p / q)(d q / d p)$. The point elasticity is the limit of the arc elasticity as the length of the arc tends to zero.
