- $n$. The inability of a person who has been hypnotized to recall, after the hypnotic session, all or part of what took place during the session. It usually occurs as a consequence of a direct suggestion given by the hypnotist during the hypnotic session but can also occur spontaneously. Also called posthypnotic amnesia.
