- A tax on increases in the value of assets. CGT is usually only collected on the realization of gains by sale or bequest; to tax unrealized capital gains would require regular valuations of all assets. In the UK capital gains tax has been levied since 1965. Only gains over some minimum sum each year ( $£ 11,100$ in tax year 2016-17) are liable to tax, and until recently it was levied only on proportional gains greater than the rise in the retail price index (RPI) since an asset was acquired. Certain forms of assets, including the main residence of any taxpayer, are exempt from UK capital gains tax.

- (CGT) A UK tax on capital gains. Most countries have a form of income tax under which they tax the profits from trading and a different tax to tax substantial disposals of assets either by traders for whom the assets are not trading stock (e.g. a trader's factory) or by individuals who do not trade (e.g. sales of shares by an investor). The latter type of tax is a capital gains tax. In the UK, capital gains tax is charged on the net amount of chargeable gains accruing to an individual in a fiscal year after deducting any allowable capital losses. There is a personal allowance for CGT ( $£11,100$ for 2016-17) and gains from various types of asset are exempt (see CHARGEABLE ASSETS). Since April 2016 the tax has been levied at a rate of either $10 \%$ or $20 \%$, depending on the total amount of an individual's taxable income during the tax year. However, the older rates of $18 \%$ or $28 \%$ still apply to gains from the sale of residential properties that are not the individual's main dwelling. See also entrepreneurs' relief was introduced.
