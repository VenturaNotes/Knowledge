- $n$. A drawing or other representation of an object that could not exist in actual three-dimensional space, the best known examples being the Freemish crate, impossible trident, the Penrose triangle, and the staircase illusion. It is a misnomer, because what is impossible is not the figure but what it represents. Impossible figures feature strongly in the work of the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersv√§rd (1915-2001) and the Dutch artist Maurits C(ornelis) Escher (1898-1970). Also called an Escher figure or an undecidable figure. See also visual illusion. Compare ambiguous FIGURE.
