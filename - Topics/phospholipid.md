## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a lipid containing a phosphate group as part of the molecule. Phospholipids are constituents of all tissues and organs, especially the brain. They are synthesized in the liver and small intestine and are involved in many of the body's metabolic processes. Examples of phospholipids are cephalins, lecithins, sphingolipids, plasmalogens, and phosphatidylserine.
## Source[^2]
- (phosphatide) One of a group of lipids having both a phosphate group and one or more fatty acids. Glycerophospholipids (or phosphoglycerides) are based on glycerol; the three hydroxyl groups are esterified with two fatty acids and a phosphate group, which may itself be bound to one of a variety of simple organic groups (e.g. in lecithin (phosphatidylcholine) it is choline; see formula). Sphingolipids are based on the alcohol sphingosine and contain only one fatty acid linked to an amino group. With their hydrophilic polar phosphate groups and long hydrophobic hydrocarbon 'tails', phospholipids readily form membrane-like structures in water. They are a major component of plasma membranes (see LIPID BILAYER).
