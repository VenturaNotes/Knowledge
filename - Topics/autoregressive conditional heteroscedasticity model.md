- A time series model in which the random error is conditionally heteroscedastic with respect to its past realizations. This model is used to describe volatility clustering, i.e. a pattern observed in many financial data where large and small deviations appear to occur in clusters. The simplest form is $\operatorname{ARCH}(1)$,$$y_{t}=\beta x_{t}+\varepsilon_{t}$$where $\varepsilon_{t}=u_{t} \sqrt{\alpha_{0}+\alpha_{1} \varepsilon_{t-1}}$ and $u_{t}$ has a standard normal distribution.
