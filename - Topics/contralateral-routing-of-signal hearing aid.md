- (CROS hearing aid) a form of hearing aid used to help people with severe or profound unilateral hearing loss. Sound information is collected by a microphone worn on the affected side and then transmitted by a thin wire or Bluetooth wireless technology to a device worn on the opposite side. If the hearing in the better ear is normal, no amplification is applied to the signal. If the better ear has a hearing loss the device also acts as a conventional hearing aid and amplifies the signal from both sides: this is known as a BICROS hearing aid.
