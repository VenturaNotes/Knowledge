- Any method of getting those producing external costs or benefits to take account of them in their decision-making. Examples include merging agents that are affected into a single entity or imposing taxes so that private costs and benefits reflect social costs and benefits. Internalization is a solution to externality problems that can work even if there are missing markets. See also Coase THEOREM.
