- (1) (programming support environment) A software system that provides support for the programming aspects of software development, repair, and enhancement. A typical system contains a central database and a set of software tools. The central database acts as a repository for all the information related to the programming activities.
- PSEs vary in the general nature of their databases and in the coverage provided by, and the degree of cooperative interaction of, the set of tools and the programming languages supported. A programming support environment might be considered as a more technologically advanced form of program development system.
- (2) (project support environment) A software system that provides support for the full life cycle of software development and also the project control and management aspects of a software-intensive project. The project support environment will have all the features of a programming support environment (see def. 1) plus software tools to support the earlier phases of software development (see CASE) and tools associated with the management and control of the project.
