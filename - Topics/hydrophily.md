- A rare form of pollination in which pollen is carried to a flower by water. It occurs by one of two methods. In Canadian pondweed (Elodea canadensis) the male flowers break off and float downstream until they contact the female flowers. In Zostera, a marine species, the filamentous pollen grains are themselves carried in the water. Compare ANEMOPHILY; ENTOMOPHILY.
