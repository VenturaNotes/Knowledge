- $n$. A form of validity that, together with convergent validity, provides evidence of construct validity. It is based on the assumption that measures of unrelated hypothetical constructs ought not to correlate highly with one another if the measures are valid: they ought to discriminate between dissimilar constructs. The concept was introduced in an article by the US psychologists Donald T(homas) Campbell (1916-96) and Donald W(inslow) Fiske (1916-2003) in the journal Psychological Bulletin in 1959. See also MULTITRAIT-MULTIMETHOD MATRIX.
