- (CPP) intermittent or constant pain in the lower abdomen or pelvis of at least six months' duration, not occurring exclusively with menstruation or intercourse and not associated with pregnancy. It may be caused by an underlying gynaecological condition, such as endometriosis or adhesions, but bowel or bladder disorders (e.g. irritable bowel syndrome, interstitial cystitis), visceral hypersensitivity, and psychological conditions may all contribute.
