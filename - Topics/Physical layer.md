## Synthesis
- Deals with physical connections and transmission of raw data bits.
- Transmission of raw data (bits) over [[physical medium|physical mediums]]
- Handles transmission of bits
### Description
- Transmission of bits over physical mediums
## Source[^1]
- The [[hub]] is specified in the physical layer
## Source[^2]
- The physical layer is also referred to as "Layer 1" as it is the lowest layer in the seven-layer network model
- First layer when counting from the bottom up
- The physical layer deals with the physical aspects of data transmission like cables, electrical signals, and connector types
	- Essentially the hardware components involved in sending raw data bits across a network
## Source[^3]
- It encodes [[frame|frames]] into electrical, optical, or radio wave signals

## Source[^4]
- It is responsible for the actual physical connection between the devices
