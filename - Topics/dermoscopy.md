- (dermatoscopy) $n$. the process whereby skin lesions are examined by a dermatoscope (an instrument with a magnifier and a nonpolarized light source). The dermatoscope is pressed firmly on the skin with a liquid medium (e.g. oil) between the instrument and the skin. The technique allows closer examination of pigment networks, vascular structures, etc., and may help to distinguish benign from malignant lesions.
