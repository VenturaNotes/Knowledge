- A long-term response to any stimulus that potentially threatens the wellbeing of an organism. An example of a resistance response is the release of ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone) in response to stress. This hormone stimulates the production of mineralocorticoid hormones (e.g. aldosterone), which promote the excretion of hydrogen ions produced in excess as a result of the increased metabolic activity resulting from the alarm response. Resistance responses diminish as normal conditions resume.
