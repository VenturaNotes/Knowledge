- A statistical significance test of the hypothesis that a sample frequency distribution is adequately explained by fitting a particular model. When data are counts of numbers of occurrences, the test uses the chi-squared distribution. Testing goodness of fit of continuous observations is less easy, requiring understanding of analysis of variance, and is only possible when some observations are replicated.
