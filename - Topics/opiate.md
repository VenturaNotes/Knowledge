## Source [^1]
- $n$. strictly, one of a group of drugs derived from opium, including morphine, codeine, and heroin (diacetylmorphine). The term may be used more loosely to include, in addition, synthetic drugs with similar effects, such as methadone and buprenorphine; in this case the term opioid is usually preferred. Opiates depress the central nervous system: they relieve pain, induce feelings of euphoria, suppress coughing, and stimulate vomiting. Because prolonged use can lead to tolerance and dependence, opioid analgesics are reserved for the relief of moderate or severe pain; other side-effects include drowsiness, nausea and vomiting, constipation, and depression of breathing.
## Source[^2]
- One of a group of drugs derived from opium, an extract of the poppy plant Papaver somniferum that depresses brain function (a narcotic action). Opiates include morphine and its synthetic derivatives, such as heroin and codeine. They are used in medicine chiefly to relieve pain, but the use of morphine and heroin is strictly controlled since they can cause drug dependence and tolerance. Opiates exert their effect by binding to cell receptors that bind endorphins, the body's endogenous opioids, or natural painkillers.
