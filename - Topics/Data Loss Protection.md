- Data loss protection (DLP) is a method for detecting and preventing data breaches on computer networks and data leaks outside of the organization. DLP tools classify information such as files, emails, applications, and packets as it is being stored, used, or transmitted. Sensitive data is monitored and protected when DLP software detects potential threats, such as ransomware attacks.
