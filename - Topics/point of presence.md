- A point of presence (POP) is an access point or location at which multiple networks or communication devices share a connection. As it pertains to the internet, a POP is where users can connect to their ISP at a local access point. POP includes infrastructure such as routers, servers, network switches, and multiplexers. Major ISPs typically have multiple POPs in different locations to enable large-scale connectivity. Content delivery networks (CDNs) also maintain various POPs in strategic locations. By storing data in POP servers closer to those requesting it, CDNs are able to deliver this data quickly and reliably.
