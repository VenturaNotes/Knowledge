- high-intensity focused ultrasound: a minimally invasive technique used for the treatment of primary localized prostate cancer and prostate cancer that has recurred after radiotherapy. An ultrasound probe is inserted into the rectum and precisely focuses a beam of high-intensity ultrasound on the cancerous tissue resulting in coagulative necrosis by raising the temperature of the target tissue to approximately $90^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The procedure may have fewer side-effects than other treatments for localized prostate cancer.
