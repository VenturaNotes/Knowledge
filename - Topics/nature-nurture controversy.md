- $n$. The debate about the relative contributions of heredity and environment to a psychological characteristic, such as intelligence. The juxtaposition of the words nature and nurture in this sense was introduced by the English schoolmaster Richard Mulcaster (1531-1611), though the phrase had already been used in Greek by the philosopher Socrates (469-399 вс). It became popular in psychology after being adopted by the English explorer, amateur scientist, and psychologist Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911). See also heritability, nurture.
