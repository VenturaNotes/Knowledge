Examples relevant to psychology include the Austrian neurologist Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), who based his theory of psychoanalysis on the pleasure principle (pleasure is Freude in German), his rival the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), who was almost 30 years younger than Freud (young is jung in German), and his feminist disciple, the German-born US psychoanalyst Karen Horney (1885-1952), who rejected his theory of penis envy. Other aptronyms include Sir Henry Head, the English neurologist; Iris C. Love, the US archaeologist who excavated the temple of Aphrodite (the Greek goddess of love) at Cnidus in Turkey in 1969; Gay Search, author of The Last Taboo: Sexual Abuse of Children (1988); and J.
