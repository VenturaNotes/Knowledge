- $n$. taking unfair advantage of another's misfortune, weakness, or vulnerability. In medical ethics, the principle of nonmaleficence means that doctors have an active duty to avoid any exploitation of their patients. This is usually held to require that professional boundaries are maintained and to prohibit personal or sexual relationships between professionals and their patients. Another example of potential exploitation is the practice of holding clinical trials and conducting research in developing countries when the treatments being tested are designed for sale and use in the West and will not be made available to those who acted as research participants or subjects.
