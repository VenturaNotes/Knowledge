- A wholesale carrier is an organization that owns and/or operates a telecom network. Wholesale carriers sell network capacity—the amount of data that a network can handle at one time—to other telecom service providers. Then, service providers use this data for services such as Wi-Fi and data center solutions. They include independent network operators and multi-system operators. Carriers might also provide telecom networks with unlit or dark optical fiber services.
