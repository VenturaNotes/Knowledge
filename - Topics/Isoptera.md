- An order of social exopterygote insects that comprises the termites. These mainly tropical insects have a complex system of castes, including wingless workers and soldiers and primary and secondary winged reproductive members. A termite colony is founded by a single reproductive pair, the nest comprising an elaborate system of tunnels in wood or soil. Termites rely on gut microflora for cellulose digestion, causing considerable damage to wooden structures if they invade houses.
