- A form of competition in which two or more producers sell goods or services at the same price but compete to increase their share of the market by such measures as advertising, sales promotion campaigns, improving the quality of the product or service, delivery time, and (for goods) improving the packaging, offering free servicing and installation, or giving free gifts of unrelated products or services.

- Competition for market share using methods other than price cuts. These include quality of product, quality of advertising, information, and instructions, reliability of promised delivery dates, reliability in use, and after-sales service. Non-price competition is particularly important when there are legal or cartel restrictions on price cutting, and where consumers use price as a signal of quality and assume that cheaper goods must be of lower quality.
