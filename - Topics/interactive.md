## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Describing a system or a mode of working in which there is a response to operator instructions as they are input. The instructions may be presented via an input device such as a keyboard or mouse, and the effect is observable sufficiently rapidly that the operator can work almost continuously. This mode of working is thus sometimes referred to as [[conversational mode]]. An interactive system for multiple users will achieve the effect by time sharing. See also MULTIACCESS SYSTEM.
## Source[^2]
- Denoting a computer system or application in which there is continuous two-way communication between the computer and its operator. The computer program prompts the operator when it needs information and stops running until the information is supplied. Interactive computer systems are also called conversational systems. Compare BATCH processing.
