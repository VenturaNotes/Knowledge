## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Describing a system or a mode of working in which there is a response to operator instructions as they are input. The instructions may be presented via an input device such as a keyboard or mouse, and the effect is observable sufficiently rapidly that the operator can work almost continuously. This mode of working is thus sometimes referred to as [[conversational mode]]. An interactive system for multiple users will achieve the effect by time sharing. See also MULTIACCESS SYSTEM.
