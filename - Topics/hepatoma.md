- (hepatocellular carcinoma) $n$. the most common primary malignant tumour of the liver. In Western countries patients with chronic hepatitis B or C or cirrhosis are at significantly increased risk of developing hepatoma. The higher incidence of hepatomas in non-Western societies (particularly the Far East and Africa) is partly due to increased hepatitis B endemicity but other factors contribute, including exposure to fungi (see AFLATOXIN) and other ingested toxins. Hepatomas often synthesize alphafetoprotein, which is a useful serum tumour marker. The treatment options depend on the number and size of hepatomas and the staging of the disease. They include surgical resection, chemotherapy, chemoembolization, local ablative treatment, and liver transplantation.
