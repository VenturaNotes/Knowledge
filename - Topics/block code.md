- A type of error-correcting or error-detecting code in which a fixed number (conventionally $k$ ) of digits are taken into the encoder at a time and then output in the form of a codeword consisting of a greater number (conventionally $n$) of digits. It is often specified as an $(n, k)$ code, with block length $k$ and codeword length $n$. The corresponding decoder takes in $n$ digits, and outputs $k$ digits, at a time. Since the codewords are longer than the input words, the possible received words are no more numerous. The codewords are only a selection of all possible words of their length: the selection method gives any code its particular properties. See also CODE.

## Source[^2]
- A code in which all the codewords have the same length.
