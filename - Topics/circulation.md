- The mass flow of fluid (e.g. blood, haemolymph, or lymph) through the tissues and organs of an animal, allowing the transport and exchange of such materials as oxygen, nutrients, and waste products (see also VASCULAR SYSTEM; LYMPHATIC SYSTEM). Smaller animals (e.g. arthropods and most molluscs) have an open circulation, i.e. the haemolymph is pumped into the body cavity, in which the internal organs are suspended. In open circulatory systems the tissues are in direct contact with the haemolymph, and materials are exchanged directly by diffusion. In a closed circulation, found in larger animals, the blood flows in vessels, which usually contain a series of one-way valves to maintain the flow in one direction. See also DOUBLE CIRCULATION; HAEMODYNAMICS; MICROCIRCULATION; SINGLE CIRCULATION.
