- in DSM-5, a psychiatric disorder characterized by one or more chronic somatic symptoms about which patients are excessively concerned, preoccupied, or fearful, formerly called somatization disorder. These fears and behaviours cause significant distress and dysfunction, and although patients may make frequent use of health-care services, they are rarely reassured and often feel their medical care has been inadequate. The disorder can disrupt personal and family relationships and lead to unnecessary medical and surgical treatment. It is sometimes treated with cognitive behavioural therapy, psychotherapy, and/or antidepressants.
