- (therapeutic embolization) $n$. the introduction of any material to reduce or completely obstruct blood flow. Conditions such as varicocele, fibroids, hepatoma, congenital arteriovenous malformations (see ANGIOMA), angiodysplasia, malignant tumours, or arterial rupture are commonly treated with embolization. Under X-ray screening control, a catheter is guided to the blood vessel (artery or vein) supplying the affected area and occluding material, such as microspheres, metallic coils, PVA (polyvinyl alcohol), or gel foam, is injected. The procedure may treat the underlying problem or simplify subsequent surgery. See also CHEMOEMBOLIZATION; COILING; UTERINE ARTERY EMBOLIZATION.
