- A test for the first-order serial correlation in errors in the presence of a lagged dependent variable, when the Durbin-Watson test is not valid. The test statistic is based on ordinary least squares residuals from the main regression, and under the null hypothesis of no serial correlation has asymptotically standard normal distribution.
