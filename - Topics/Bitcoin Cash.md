- Bitcoin Cash is a decentralized peer-to-peer cryptocurrency that is built on the same blockchain as Bitcoin. It was initially created to accommodate a larger block size than Bitcoin, increasing the amount of transactions that can take place in a single block. This type of cryptocurrency encourages the economic freedom of its users by integrating strong protections against the devolution of finances through uncapped inflation. In other words, Bitcoin Cash has a fixed supply, limiting the amount of Bitcoin Cash in circulation to 21 million coins. All Bitcoin Cash transactions are transparent, anonymous, immutable, and secure.
