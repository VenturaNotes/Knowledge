- $n$. the outer covering of the body, consisting of an outer layer, the epidermis, and an inner layer, the dermis (see illustration overleaf). Beneath the dermis is a layer of fatty tissue. The skin has several functions. The epidermis protects the body from injury and also from invasion by parasites. It also helps to prevent the body from becoming dehydrated. The combination of erectile hairs, sweat glands, and blood capillaries in the skin form part of the temperature-regulating mechanism of the body. When the body is too hot, loss of heat is increased by sweating and by the dilation of the capillaries. When the body is too cold the sweat glands are inactive, the capillaries contract, and a layer of air is trapped over the epidermis by the erected hairs. The skin also acts as an organ of excretion (by the secretion of sweat) and as a sense organ (it contains receptors that are sensitive to heat, cold, touch, and pain). The layer of fat that lies underneath the dermis can act as a reservoir of food and water. Anatomical name: cutis.

- The outer layer of the body of a vertebrate. It is composed of two layers, the epidermis and dermis, with a complex nervous and blood supply. The skin may bear a variety of specialized structures, including hair, scales, and feathers. This skin has an important role in protecting the body from mechanical injury, water loss, and the entry of harmful agents (e.g. disease-causing bacteria; see IMMUNITY). It is also a sense organ, containing receptors sensitive to pain, temperature, and pressure (see MEISSNER'S CORPUSCLES; MERKEL'S DISC; PACINIAN CORPUSCLE). In warm-blooded animals it helps regulate body temperature by means of hair, fur, or feathers and sweat glands.
