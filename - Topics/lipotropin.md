- Either of two peptide hormones produced in the anterior pituitary gland that trigger the mobilization of fat deposits and the transfer of lipid components to the bloodstream. $\beta$-Lipotropin is formed by cleavage of the precursor pro-opiomelanocortin, and is itself cleaved to form $\gamma$-lipotropin and other active peptides, including endorphins and melanocyte-stimulating hormone.
