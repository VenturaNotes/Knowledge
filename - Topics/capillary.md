- $n$. an extremely narrow blood vessel, approximately $5-20 \mu \mathrm{~m}$ in diameter. Capillaries form networks in most tissues; they are supplied with blood by arterioles and drained by venules. The vessel wall is only one cell thick, which enables exchange of oxygen, carbon dioxide, water, salts, etc., between the blood and the tissues (see illustrations).
