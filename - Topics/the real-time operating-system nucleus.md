- A project commenced in 1984 at Tokyo University to create a framework for the design of microprocessor systems for workstations, personal computers, and industrial embedded applications. The project has developed Tron architectures on silicon, now manufactured by several Japanese companies, and three operating systems: BTron, [[CTron]], and ITron.
- BTron is a business-oriented operating system for personal computers with English, Japanese, and other character set capabilities. CTron is a (network) communications-oriented operating system. ITron is a real-time operating system, designed to give rapid response to external events and intended for applications ranging from ATMs (automatic teller machines) to aircraft landing systems. ITron is now widely used in many electronic devices. In 2010 the TRON project was taken over by the T-Engine Forum, which continues its work on open-source real-time operating-system kernels.
