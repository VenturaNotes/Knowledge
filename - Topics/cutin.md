- A polymer of long-chain fatty acids that forms the main constituent of the cuticle of epidermal plant cells. The cutin polymers are cross-linked forming a network, which is embedded in a matrix of waxes. The deposition of cutin (cutinization) reduces water loss by the plant and helps prevent the entry of pathogens. See also sUbERIN.
