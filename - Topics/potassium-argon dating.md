- A dating technique for certain rocks that depends on the decay of the radioisotope potassium-40 to argon-40, a process with a half-life of about $1.27 \times$ M $10^{10}$ years. It assumes that all the argon-40 formed in the potassium-bearing mineral accumulates within it and that all the argon present is formed by the decay of potassium-40. The mass of argon-40 and potassium-40 in the sample is estimated and the sample is then dated from the equation:$${ }^{40} \mathrm{Ar}=0.1102^{40} \mathrm{~K}\left(\mathrm{e}^{\lambda t}-1\right)$$where $\lambda$ is the decay constant and $t$ is the time in years since the mineral cooled to about $300^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, when the ${ }^{40} \mathrm{Ar}$ became trapped in the crystal lattice. The method is effective for micas, feldspar, and some other minerals.
