- An average obtained by calculating the $n$th root of a set of $n$ numbers. For example the geometric mean of 7, 100, and 107 is $\sqrt[3]{74,900}$ $=42.15$, which is considerably less than the arithmetic mean of 71.3.
## Source[^2]
- The geometric mean $G$ of $n$ numbers $\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ is defined by$$G=\left(x_{1} x_{2} \ldots x_{n}\right)^{1 / n}$$The value of the geometric mean is always greater than that of the harmonic mean but less than the arithmetic mean. The geometric mean is used to compute average growth rates. For example, if an economy grows 5 per cent in year 1 and 3 per cent in year 2 then the geometric mean growth rate is $G=(1.05 \times 1.03)^{1 / 2}=1.039952$.
