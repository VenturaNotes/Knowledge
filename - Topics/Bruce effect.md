- $n$. The failure of a recently mated female mouse to produce offspring if housed near a strange male, although the presence of her own stud male or a strange castrated male does not have this effect. The destruction of the female's olfactory bulbs eleminates the effect, because it is caused by the presence in the strange male's urine of a pheromone that inhibits the female's secretion of prolactin and implantation of the fertilized ovum. Also called pregnancy blockage. \[Named after the British reproductive biologist Hilda M(argaret) Bruce (1903-74), who first reported it in 1959]
