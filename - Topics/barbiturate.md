## Source [^1]
- $n$. any of a group of drugs, derived from barbituric acid, that depress activity of the central nervous system and were formerly widely used as sedatives and hypnotics. They are classified into three groups according to their duration of action $\textendash$ short, intermediate, and long. Because they produce tolerance and psychological and physical dependence, have serious toxic side-effects (see BARBITURISM), and can be fatal following large overdosage, barbiturates have been largely replaced in clinical use by safer drugs. The main exception is the very short-acting drug thiopental, which is used to induce anaesthesia. See also AMOBARBITAL; BUTOBARBITAL; PHENOBARBITAL.
