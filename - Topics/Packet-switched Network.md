- A packet-switched network (PSN) is a type of data-transmission network that divides information into small segments called packets. These packets travel separately and may take different paths to reach their destination. In addition, packets from many computers can travel over the same routes simultaneously without a decrease in speed. When a computer receives the packets, they're reassembled.
