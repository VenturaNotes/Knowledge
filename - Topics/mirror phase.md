- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a concept introduced in 1936 by the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (1901-81) to denote the stage of human development between 6 months and 18 months, when the infant, though still helpless, is capable of recognizing its body as a unity and imagining a state of being able to master it. According to Lacan, this phase forms the basis on which the ego develops, and it is called the mirror phase because it is evidenced by the infant's jubilant response to its own mirror reflection, with which it is believed to identify.
