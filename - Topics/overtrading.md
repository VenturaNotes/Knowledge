- Trading by an organization beyond the resources provided by its existing capital. Overtrading tends to lead to liquidity problems as too much stock is bought on credit and too much credit is extended to customers, so that ultimately there is not sufficient cash available to pay the debts as they arise. The solution is either to cut back on trading or to raise further permanent capital.
