- For two arbitrary sequences $\left\{a_{k}\right\}$ and $\left\{b_{k}\right\}$ with $A_{k}=\sum_{r=1}^{k} a_{r}$, the result that $\sum_{r=j}^{k} a_{r} b_{r}=\sum_{r=j}^{k} A_{j}\left(b_{j}-b_{j+1}\right)+A_{k} b_{k+1}-A_{j-1} b_{j}$. This has some similarities with the formula for integration by parts.
