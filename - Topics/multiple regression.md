- A regression with two or more explanatory variables. Variable $y$, for example, may be explained by variables $x_{i}, i=1$, $2, \ldots, K$. The multiple linear regression equation is then$$y_{t}=\alpha+\beta_{1} x_{1 t}+\beta_{2} x_{2 t}+\ldots+\beta_{K} x_{K t}+\varepsilon_{t}$$

- $n$. Multiple linear regression analysis, a statistical method for analyzing the joint and separate influences of two or more predictor variables (also called independent variables) on a dependent variable, usually through a linear model. It is a generalization of bivariate regression analysis. The form of a multiple regression equation for $k$ independent variables is a weighted sum:$$Y=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1} X_{1}+\beta_{2} X_{2}+\ldots+\beta_{k} X_{k}$$where $Y$ is the predicted score on the dependent variable, each $X_{i}$ is one of the predictor variables, $\beta_{0}$ is the intercept indicating the value of $Y$ when all of the predictor variables are equal to zero, and each $\beta_{i}$ is a standardized regression coefficient indicating the relative importance of the corresponding independent variable in determining the predicted value of the dependent variable.
