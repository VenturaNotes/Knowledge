- DuckDuckGo is an internet search engine that does not track the user searches made through its browser extension or its mobile application. In addition to refraining from tracking user search history, DuckDuckGo does not use cookies, collect user IP addresses, personal information, or compile user profiles. Unlike other search engines, DuckDuckGo emphasizes privacy and security for its users by prohibiting ads from targeting its users based on their browsing history and personal data.
