- $n$. A device used to study visual discrimination in rats. It comprises a platform on which the rat is placed and two vertical cards, each containing a visual stimulus, towards which the rat jumps. If the rat chooses the right card, then a door swings open and the rat lands in a chamber and receives a food reward; if it chooses wrongly, it bumps against a fixed door and falls into a net below. \[Named after the US physiological psychologist Karl Spencer Lashley (1890-1958) who invented it]
