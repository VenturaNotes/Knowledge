- (1) (of a vertex of a graph) The number of edges incident with the vertex, i.e. that emanate from that vertex. In a directed graph, the [[indegree]] is the number of edges entering a vertex while the [[outdegree]] is the number leaving a vertex. 
- (2) (of a node in a tree) The number of children of that node, i.e. the number of subtrees rooted at that node. More correctly, this is the outdegree of the node. 
- (3) (of a tree) The maximum degree of all the nodes in the tree. 
- (4) (of a polynomial) See POLYNOMIAL.
