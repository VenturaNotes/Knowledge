- $n$. A non-technical name for a condition occasionally affecting Jewish, Christian, and other pilgrim-tourists visiting Jerusalem who develop delusions (usually transient) of being biblical personalities such as Jesus Christ, John the Baptist, or Mary Magdalene. The Argentine-Israeli psychiatrist Yair Carlos Bar-El (1937-2009) first identified and named the syndrome in 1982 and discussed it in articles in the journal Comprehensive Psychiatry in 1991 and the British Journal of Psychiatry in 2000. Compare Stendhal syndrome.
