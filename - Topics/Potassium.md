## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a mineral element and an important constituent of the human body. It is the main base ion of intracellular fluid. Together with sodium, it helps to maintain the electrical potential of the nervous system and is thus essential for the functioning of nerve and muscle. Normal blood levels are between 3.5 and 5 mmols/litre. High concentrations occur particularly in kidney failure and may lead to arrhythmia and finally to cardiac arrest. Low values result from fluid loss, e.g. due to vomiting or diarrhoea, and this may lead to general muscle paralysis. A diet high in potassium can help to lower blood pressure; good sources are fruit, vegetables, and wholegrain cereals. Symbol: K.

- Symbol K. A soft silvery metallic element that is an essential element for living organisms. The potassium ion, $\mathrm{K}^{+}$, is the most abundant cation in plant tissues, being absorbed through the roots and being used in such processes as protein synthesis. In animals the high intracellular concentration of $\mathrm{K}^{+}$relative to the extracellular fluid is a key component in establishing the resting potential of neurons, and is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump. Flows of potassium and sodium ions across the neuron plasma membrane are responsible for the changes of electrical potential that accompany the transmission of nerve impulses. See POTASSIUM ION CHANNEL.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A light, silvery, alkaline, metallic element that is highly reactive chemically and is an important electrolyte in the body. It is the predominant cation within cells and is required for contraction of skeletal muscles and relaxation of cardiac muscle. K abbrev. \[From Latin potassa potash]
