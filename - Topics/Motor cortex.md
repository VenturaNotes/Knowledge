- A region of cortex in the frontal lobe that is involved with voluntary movement.
## Source[^2]
- the region of the cerebral cortex that is responsible for initiating nerve impulses that bring about voluntary activity in the muscles of the body. It is possible to map out the cortex to show which of its areas is responsible for which particular part of the body. The motor cortex of the left cerebral hemisphere is responsible for muscular activity in the right side of the body.

- $n$. Areas in the cerebral cortex, namely the primary motor cortex, premotor cortex, supplementary motor area, and frontal eye field, devoted to the control of bodily movements. The primary motor cortex occupies the precentral gyrus immediately in front of the central sulcus, directly opposite the primary somatosensory cortex, containing in each cerebral hemisphere an inverted representation of the opposite side of the body with the hand and tongue disproportionately overrepresented. The premotor cortex, in front of the primary motor cortex, is about six times as large as the primary motor cortex and is concerned with postural coordination and execution of movements controlled by visual or tactile feedback. The supplementary motor area (SMA), still further forward in the frontal lobe, is concerned with the coordination of preplanned or preprogrammed movements. The frontal eye field, immediately in front of the area where the head is represented in the premotor cortex, is responsible for voluntary saccadic eye movements, as when tracking moving images or reading.
