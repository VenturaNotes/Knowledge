- (innominate bone) a bone formed by the fusion of the ilium, ischium, and pubis. It articulates with the femur by the acetabulum of the ilium, a deep socket into which the head of the femur fits (see HIP JOINT). Between the pubis and ischium, below and slightly in front of the acetabulum, is a large opening $\textendash$ the obturator foramen. The right and left hip bones form part of the pelvis.
