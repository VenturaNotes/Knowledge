- There are two types of reagents in a reaction
	- [[Limiting Reagent]]
	- [[Excess Reagent]]
## Source [^1]
- A compound or mixture added to a system to start or test a chemical reaction
- A reagent can be used to determine the presence or absence of a specific chemical substance as certain reactions are triggered by the binding of reagents to the substance or other related substances
## Source[^2]
- (1) Which of the following is true about excess reagents?
	- Consumes partially
		- This is because in a chemical reaction, reagents (reactants) react with each other according to a specific [[stoichiometric ratio]]. Since the excess reagent is present in a larger quantity than required by the reaction, it is only partially consumed while the limiting reagent is fully used up
- (2) Which of the following is true about limiting reagents?
	- Consumes completely
