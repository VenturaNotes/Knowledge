- $n$. a tender inflamed area of the skin containing pus. The infection is usually caused by the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus entering through a hair follicle or a break in the skin, and local injury or lowered constitutional resistance may encourage the development of boils. Boils usually heal when the pus is released or with antibiotic treatment, though occasionally they may cause more widespread infection. Medical name: furuncle.
