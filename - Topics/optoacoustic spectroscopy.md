## Source [^1]
- A spectroscopic technique in which electromagnetic radiation is absorbed by materials that generate sound waves. This technique has been used particularly in gases. The principle underlying optoacoustic spectroscopy is that the absorbed electromagnetic radiation is converted into motion, which is associated with the production of sound waves. See also photoacoustic spectroscopy
