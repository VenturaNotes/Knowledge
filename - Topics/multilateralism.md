- The belief that international economic relations should be conducted on the basis of equal treatment for all non-nationals. This applies both to trade, where multilateralism implies multilateral trade rather than preferential arrangements within trade blocs, and to international capital movements. Multilateralism also implies that negotiations over international trade and investment should be conducted through multinational bodies and not on a bilateral basis.
