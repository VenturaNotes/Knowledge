- Corporate communication is the management of all communication in a business. It includes the management of internal communication (communication that takes place within an organization) and external communication (communication between an organization and the outside world.) Corporate communication can help impress and influence internal as well as external stakeholders such as employees, customers, suppliers, and investors. It can include the management of advertising, press releases, sales presentations, newsletters, social media posts, videos, emails, and website copy. Essentially, corporate communication helps organizations share information with the right people at the right time.
