- (paramesonephric duct) either of the paired ducts that form adjacent to the Wolffian ducts (see MESONEPHROS) in the embryo. In the female these ducts develop into the Fallopian tubes, uterus, and part of the vagina. In the male anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), produced by the fetal testis, arrests their development and by the tenth week of fetal life they have degenerated almost completely. In females AMH is produced by the ovary and levels are used as a measure of certain aspects of ovarian function, such as response to in vitro fertilization and assessing such conditions as polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian failure, and intersex conditions in infants. \[J. P. Müller (1801-58), German physiologist]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. Either of the pair of ducts that are present in a human embryo, alongside the pair of Wolffian ducts, and that in a female develop by default into Fallopian tubes, uterus, and the upper part of the vagina, and in a male atrophy and disappear under the influence of Müllerian inhibiting substance secreted by the embryonic testes while the Wolffian ducts develop into the male internal sex organs. Also called the Müllerian system. \[Named after the German physiologist Johannes Peter Müller (1801-58) who discovered them]
