- (paramesonephric duct) either of the paired ducts that form adjacent to the Wolffian ducts (see MESONEPHROS) in the embryo. In the female these ducts develop into the Fallopian tubes, uterus, and part of the vagina. In the male anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), produced by the fetal testis, arrests their development and by the tenth week of fetal life they have degenerated almost completely. In females AMH is produced by the ovary and levels are used as a measure of certain aspects of ovarian function, such as response to in vitro fertilization and assessing such conditions as polycystic ovary syndrome, premature ovarian failure, and intersex conditions in infants. \[J. P. Müller (1801-58), German physiologist]
