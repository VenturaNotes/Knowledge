- $n$. A theory of decision making, formalized in 1947 by the Hungarian-born US mathematician John von Neumann (1903-57) and the German-born US economist Oskar Morgenstern (1902-77), according to which a decision maker chooses actions or strategies that maximize expected utility, and utilities are determined by revealed preferences. If the probabilities are subjective, then it is called subjective expected utility theory.
