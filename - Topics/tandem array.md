## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- (in genetics) A series of copies of a gene arranged in tandem along a chromosome. Nucleolar organizers, for example, can contain up to 250 copies of a single ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene in tandem. Genes for histone proteins also occur in tandem arrays. Such arrays ensure that large amounts of the gene product are synthesized by the cell.
