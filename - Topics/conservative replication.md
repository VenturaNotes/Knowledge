## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A hypothesis that envisaged DNA replication occurring by one DNA molecule initiating the synthesis of a new molecule while remaining intact. The accepted mechanism ( see SEMICONSERVATIVE REPLICATION) is that the DNA molecule divides to provide two templates, each for synthesizing the other half of the molecule. Compare DISPERSIVE REPLICATION.
