- The theory that in rising markets it can be advisable for an investor to buy securities or other assets that he or she suspects to be overvalued, as it will always be possible to find a purchaser to buy them at an even higher price (the 'greater fool'). This way of thinking is held to be a factor in many speculative bubbles.
