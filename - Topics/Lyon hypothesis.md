## Source [^1]
- the hypothesis that gene dosage imbalance between males and females, because of the presence of two X chromosomes in females (XX) as opposed to only one in males (XY), is compensated for by random inactivation of one of the X chromosomes in the somatic cells of females. The inactivated X chromosome becomes the Barr body (see SEX CHROMATIN). \[M. F. Lyon (1925-2014), British geneticist]
