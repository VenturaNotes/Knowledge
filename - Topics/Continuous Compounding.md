- continuous compounding The charging of interest or discounting of future receipts on a continuous basis. At a rate of $100 r$ per cent, added annually, a loan will have grown to $(1+r)^{T}$ times its original value after $T$ years. If interest is added $v$ times a year, it will grow to $(1+r / v)^{T v}$, which is greater the larger is $v$. As $v$ tends to infinity, $(1+r / v)^{T v}$ tends to the limit $e^{r T}$, where $e$ is the exponential constant. Similarly, if a future receipt due in $T$ years is discounted to find its present value at a continuous rate $r$, its present value with continuous discounting is $e^{-r T}$ times what is due at the end of the $T$ years.
