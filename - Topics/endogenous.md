- (2) formerly (until the 1980s), denoting a type of depression (also known as melancholia) that was thought to arise totally biologically and therefore without any particular triggers. It stood in contrast to reactive depression, which was supposed to have been primarily triggered by stress or trauma. Today this differentiation is not usually made as the validity of separating these two types of depression could not be proven.
