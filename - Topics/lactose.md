- $n$. a sugar, consisting of one molecule of glucose and one of galactose, found only in milk. Lactose is split into its constituent sugars by the enzyme lactase, which is secreted in the small intestine. This enzyme is missing or is of low activity in certain people of some Eastern and African races. This leads to the inability to absorb lactose, known as lactose intolerance.
## Source[^2]
- (milk sugar) A sugar comprising one glucose molecule linked to a galactose molecule. Lactose is manufactured by the mammary gland and occurs only in milk. For example, cowsâ€™ milk contains about $4.7 \%$ lactose. It is less sweet than sucrose (cane sugar). Insufficiency of the lactase enzyme responsible for digesting lactose causes lactose intolerance, where excess lactose is fermented by bacteria in the digestive tract.
