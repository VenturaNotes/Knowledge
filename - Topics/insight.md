## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. one's level of awareness of one's illness. Insight can be fully or partially intact or absent. Full insight requires an understanding that one has an illness, seeks help, and complies with treatment. Insight can be impaired temporarily through drug intoxication or through medical or mental illness or permanently after brain damage or in some cases of dementia. The term is also applied in psychology to the patient's accuracy of understanding the development of his or her personality and problems; in this sense insight can be enhanced by psychotherapy.
