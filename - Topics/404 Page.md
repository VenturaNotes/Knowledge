- A 404 page is a webpage on a website that lets a user know that they have located the internet domain they have requested, but the webpage itself does not exist. It can also show up as a “Page not found” on a website. Most businesses use 404 pages to turn a bad user experience into a good one. Businesses accomplish this by using 404 pages to suggest other relevant webpages on their website, allow users to report broken links, and offer a link to their website homepage. This encourages users to stay on the companyʻs website instead of switching to a different one by a competitor.
