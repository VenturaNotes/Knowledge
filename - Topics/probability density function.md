- For a continuous random variable $X$, a probability density function (or pdf) of $X$ is the function $f_X$ such that $$Pr(a \le X \le b) = \int_a^bf_X(x) \space dx.$$A probability density function is necessarily non-negative with integral 1. The Cantor distribution is an example of a continuous random variable which does not have a probability density function. 
- Suppose that, for the random variable $X$, a sample is taken and a corresponding histogram is drawn with class intervals of a certain width. Then, loosely speaking, as the number of observations increases and the width of the class intervals decreases, the histogram assumes more closely the shape of the graph of the probability density function
