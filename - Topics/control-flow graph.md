## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A directed graph representing the sequence of execution in a program unit, in which nodes represent branching points or subprogram calls in a program, and arcs represent linear sequences of code. From the control-flow graph an analysis can show
	- The structure of the program,
	- Starts and ends of program segments,
	- Unreachable code and dynamic halts,
	- branches from within loops,
	- entry and exit points for loops,
	- paths through the program.
