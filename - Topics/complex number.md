- A number that, for mathematical convenience, is regarded as being composed of two scalars (called the real and imaginary parts of the complex number), and is subject to a standard set of operations according to the rules of complex algebra.
- In engineering, and especially control engineering and electrical and electronic engineering, complex numbers and complex operations are an essential tool without which calculations would be much more difficult to express and understand. Consequently, support for complex numbers and operations is an important consideration in the design of programming languages, packages, and libraries for use in engineering applications.
