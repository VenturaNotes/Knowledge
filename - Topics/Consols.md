- UK government undated securities. The name is short for Consolidated Fund Annuities; the Consolidated Fund is the government's account at the Bank of England into which tax revenues are paid. Consols are redeemable at par at the government's discretion, but the holders have no right to demand redemption. The nominal yields on Consols are low, so the possibility of redemption is remote. As these are perpetuities, the price of Consols is proportional to $1 / r$, the reciprocal of the long-term interest rate.

- Government securities that pay interest but have no redemption date. The present bonds, called consolidated annuities or consolidated stock, are the result of merging several loans at various different times going back to the 18th century. Their original interest rate was $3 \%$ on the nominal price of $£ 100$; some now pay 2.5% and therefore stand at a price that makes their annual yield comparable to long-dated gilt-edged securities, e.g. at $£ 31$ they yield about $8 \%$.
