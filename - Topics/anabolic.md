## Source [^1]
- adj. promoting tissue growth by increasing the metabolic processes involved in protein synthesis. Anabolic steroids are synthetic forms of male sex hormones (see ANDROGEN); they include nandrolone. They were formerly used to help weight gain in underweight patients, such as the elderly and those with serious illnesses, but are now used mainly to stimulate the production of blood cells by the bone marrow in some forms of aplastic anaemia. Some anabolic steroids cause virilization in women and liver damage.
