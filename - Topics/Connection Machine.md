- (Trademark) A parallel processor, now defunct, in which many processor-memory pairs$\textemdash$small computers$\textemdash$operated simultaneously. Central to the machine was a communication network that permitted the small computers to exchange information in a pattern suited to the algorithm being executed. The Connection Machine marketed in 1994 could yield a sustained performance of 20 Gflops from a 512 processor configuration.
