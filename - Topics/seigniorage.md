- The profits accruing to the issuer of legal tender, mainly as a result of the difference between the material costs of producing currency and its face value. The term is frequently used in reference to the US Treasury's earnings from producing coins and notes; as the producer of the world's major reserve currency and black market currency, the USA can obtain considerable gains from printing money.

- The profits made by a ruler from issuing money, or 'inflation tax'. Originally this referred to the profits from the issue of coinage with a face value greater than its cost of production. Nowadays seigniorage refers to the ability of governments to obtain goods and services in return for newly created money. A growing economy needs some extra money, but if governments issue too much this produces inflation, which reduces the real purchasing power of the money they have already issued.
