- An optimization technique. Parts of a program that have just enough data are evaluated, other parts are kept unchanged. For logic programming languages, unification and resolution automatically support mechanisms for partial evaluation such as: unfolding of procedure calls with their bodies, forward and backward propagation of data structures, and evaluation of built-in functions wherever possible. Special techniques, for example lazy evaluation, are necessary for partial evaluation of functional languages.
