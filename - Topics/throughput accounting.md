## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An approach to short-term decision making in manufacturing in which all conversion costs are treated as though they were fixed and products are ranked if a particular constraint or scarce resource exists. Decisions are made using the throughput accounting ratio (TAR) as follows:$$\begin{align}\\&\text{return per factory hour/cost per}\\& \text{factory hour,}\end{align}$$where $$\begin{align}\\&\text{return per factory hour =}\\&\text{(sales price - material cost) / hours on}\\& \text{scarce resource;}\end{align}$$and $$\begin{align}\\&\text{cost per factory hour =}\\& \text{total factory cost / total available hours}\\& \text{of constraint}.\end{align}$$
- More recently, throughput accounting has been applied in more general areas of management accounting
