- A method for estimating the structural parameters of a single equation in a simultaneous equations model. It involves estimating the parameters of the system in the reduced form using ordinary least squares and solving for the structural parameters in terms of the reduced form parameters. This procedure may result in over- or under-identification of the structural parameters.
