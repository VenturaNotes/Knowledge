- $n$. a large scavenger cell (a phagocyte) present in connective tissue and many major organs and tissues, including the bone marrow, spleen, lymph nodes, liver (see KupfFER CELLS), and the central nervous system (see MICROGLIA). They are closely related to monocytes. Fixed macrophages (histiocytes) are stationary within connective tissue; free macrophages wander between cells and aggregate at focal sites of infection, where they remove bacteria or other foreign bodies from blood or tissues. See also RETICULOENDOTHELIAL SYSTEM.
