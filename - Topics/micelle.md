## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An aggregate of molecules in a colloid. For example, phospholipids in aqueous solution form micelles$\textemdash$small clusters of molecules in which the nonpolar hydrocarbon groups are in the center and the hydrophilic polar groups are on the outside. The products of fat digestion are dispersed into micelles by the action of bile salts, which facilitates their absorption in the small intestine.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. one of the microscopic particles into which the products of fat digestion (i.e. fatty acids and monoglycerides), present in the gut, are dispersed by the action of bile salts. Fatty material in this finely dispersed form is more easily absorbed by the small intestine.
