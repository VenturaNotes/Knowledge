- An aggregate of molecules in a colloid. For example, phospholipids in aqueous solution form micelles$\textemdash$small clusters of molecules in which the nonpolar hydrocarbon groups are in the centre and the hydrophilic polar groups are on the outside. The products of fat digestion are dispersed into micelles by the action of bile salts, which facilitates their absorption in the small intestine.
