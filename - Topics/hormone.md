- $n$. a substance that is produced in one part of the body (by an endocrine gland, such as the thyroid, adrenal, or pituitary), passes into the bloodstream and is carried to other (distant) organs or tissues, where it acts to modify their structure or function. Examples of hormones are corticosteroids (from the adrenal cortex), adrenaline (from the adrenal medulla), androgens and oestrogens (from the testis and ovary, respectively), thyroid hormone (from the thyroid gland), and insulin (from the islets of Langerhans). The pituitary gland secretes a variety of hormones, whose release is controlled by specific releasing hormones.
