- $n$. a substance that is produced in one part of the body (by an endocrine gland, such as the thyroid, adrenal, or pituitary), passes into the bloodstream and is carried to other (distant) organs or tissues, where it acts to modify their structure or function. Examples of hormones are corticosteroids (from the adrenal cortex), adrenaline (from the adrenal medulla), androgens and oestrogens (from the testis and ovary, respectively), thyroid hormone (from the thyroid gland), and insulin (from the islets of Langerhans). The pituitary gland secretes a variety of hormones, whose release is controlled by specific releasing hormones.

- (1) A substance that is manufactured and secreted in very small quantities into the bloodstream by an endocrine gland or a specialized nerve cell (see NEUROHORMONE) and regulates the growth or functioning of a specific tissue or organ in a distant part of the body. For example, the hormone insulin controls the rate and manner in which glucose is used by the body. Other hormones include the sex hormones, corticosteroids, adrenaline, thyroxine, and growth hormone.
