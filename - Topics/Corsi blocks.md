- $n$. A popular test of short-term memory and spatial ability based on a set of nine wooden blocks, arranged quasi-randomly on a board with numbered faces visible to the experimenter but not to the person being tested (see illustration). The examiner taps the blocks in an arbitrary sequence, and the examinee attempts to reproduce the sequence. In clinical use, difficulty is varied by altering the sequence length. Also called the Corsi tapping test or Corsi block-tapping test. \[Named after the Canadian PhD student (later farmer) Philip (Michael) Corsi who introduced it in his PhD research; first published by the English neuropsychologist Brenda Milner (born 1918) in an article in the journal Clinical Neurosurgery in 1972]
