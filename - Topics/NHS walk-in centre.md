They provide advice and treatment for minor injuries and illnesses as well as guidance on how to use NHS services. Currently, the NHS offers a mix of walk-in centres, urgent care centres, minor injury units, and urgent treatment centres, all with different levels of service. By the end of 2019, these will all be called urgent treatment centres.
