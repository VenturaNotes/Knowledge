- (exotic) A species of organism that is not native to a locality, having been moved there from its natural range by humans or other agents. Some alien species, such as rats, are introduced mainly by accident in cargoes or transport vessels, while others are transferred intentionally, often for their ornamental or economic value. An alien that establishes a self-sustaining wild population is described as naturalized, whereas one that depends on continual introduction is termed a casual.
