- $n$. retraction and constriction of the foreskin behind the glans penis. This occurs in some patients with phimosis on erection of the penis or in patients who have a urethral catheter in place: the tight foreskin cannot be drawn back over the glans and becomes painful and oedematous. In most cases manual compression, under local or general anaesthesia, allows replacement of the foreskin. Alternatively, a small needle can be used to puncture holes in the oedematous foreskin, followed by gentle but firm pressure allowing reduction of the paraphimosis. Circumcision may be required to prevent a recurrence.
