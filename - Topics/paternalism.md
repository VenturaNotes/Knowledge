- The attitude favoring laws and policies which seek to control people's actions, overriding their preferences for their own good. An example is a central planner whose utility, or welfare function, depends on the decision variables of the individual agents, rather than on their utility levels. In the overlapping generations economy the paternalistic altruism of a parent is modeled, for example, by including in their utility function the lifetime consumption or income of their offspring, rather than the offspring's utility level; the latter approach is non-paternalistic altruism.
