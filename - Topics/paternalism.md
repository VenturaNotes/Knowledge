- The attitude favoring laws and policies which seek to control people's actions, overriding their preferences for their own good. An example is a central planner whose utility, or welfare function, depends on the decision variables of the individual agents, rather than on their utility levels. In the overlapping generations economy the paternalistic altruism of a parent is modeled, for example, by including in their utility function the lifetime consumption or income of their offspring, rather than the offspring's utility level; the latter approach is non-paternalistic altruism.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. an attitude or policy that overrides a person's own wishes (autonomy) in pursuit of his or her best interests. The classic argument against paternalism of the philosopher John Stuart Mill is that intervention is justified only when trying to prevent a person from causing harm to others, not to himself. However, a form of paternalism may be justified when a person lacks the capacity to make decisions for him- or herself, assuming there is no valid advance directive, decision, or statement or a proxy with power of attorney to represent the patient's wishes. See also THERAPEUTIC PRIVILEGE. â€”paternalistic adj.
