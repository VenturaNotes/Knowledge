- Benefits paid by the UK Department for Work and Pensions to compensate for disablement resulting from an industrial accident or from certain diseases arising from the nature of a person's employment. A weekly payment is made on a scale of disablement ranging from $14 \%$ to $100 \%$. No benefit is paid for less than $14 \%$ disablement, except in the case of certain respiratory diseases. Claimants have to submit to a medical examination. The payment is made if the claimant is still suffering disability 15 weeks or more after the accident or onset of the disease.
