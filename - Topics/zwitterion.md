- $n$. an ion that bears a positive and a negative charge. Amino acids can yield zwitterions.
## Source[^2]
- (ampholyte ion) An ion that has a positive and negative charge on the same group of atoms. Zwitterions can be formed from compounds that contain both acid groups and basic groups in their molecules. For example, the amino acid glycine has the formula $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{N}\text{.}\mathrm{CH}_{2} \text{.} \mathrm{COOH}$. However, under neutral conditions, it exists in the different form of the zwitterion ${ }^{+} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{N} \text{.} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \text{.} \mathrm{COO}^{-}$, which can be regarded as having been produced by an internal neutralization reaction (transfer of a proton from the carboxyl group to the amino group). Glycine therefore has some properties characteristic of ionic compounds, e.g. a high melting point and solubility in water. In acid solutions, the positive ion ${ }^{+} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{NCH}_{2} \mathrm{COOH}$ is formed. In basic solutions, the negative ion $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{NCH}_{2} \mathrm{COO}^{-}$predominates. The name comes from the German zwei, two.
