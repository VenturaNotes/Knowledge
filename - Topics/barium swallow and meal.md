- a radiological technique used to assess the anatomy and function of the upper gastrointestinal tract. The patient swallows radiopaque contrast (barium sulphate), which coats the mucosal surfaces of the oesophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The descent of the barium is charted by a series of radiographs. Gas-forming agents (such as sodium bicarbonate) may be given to aid gastric distension and improve the quality of the images. This can be used to diagnose disorders of oesophageal motor function, tumors, peptic ulcers, hiatus hernias, and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. Many indications for this examination have been replaced by the use of an endoscope.
