- $n$. Any of the ovoid (egg-shaped) areas in the primary visual cortex (Area V1), about a quarter of a millimeter in diameter and separated by half-millimeter interblobs, containing neurons with double-opponent receptive fields sensitive to light of a specific wavelength (red-green and blue-yellow), and others with ordinary center-surround receptive fields (white-black), not at all sensitive to shape or movement, responsible for perception of colors including achromatic shades of black, white, and grey. Blobs are found in layers 2 and 3 of the primary visual cortex, receiving projections from sublayers $4 \mathrm{C} \alpha$ and $4 \mathrm{C} \beta$ and projecting to Area V2 of the visual cortex, which in turn projects to Area V4 in the fusiform gyrus, an area specialized for color vision. See also W Cell. \[So called because it shows up as a blob when the cerebral cortex is stained for the enzyme cytochrome oxidase]
