- An equation, based on the second of Newton's laws of motion, that governs the motion of a particle. In vector form, the equation is $m\ddot r = F$, where $F$ is the total force acting on the particle of mass $m$. In Cartesian coordinates, this is equivalent to the three differential equations $m\ddot x = F_1$, $m\ddot y = F_2$ and $m\ddot z = F_3$, where $F= F_1i + F_2j + F_3k$. In cylindrical polar coordinates, taken here to be $(r, \theta, z),$ it is equivalent to $m(\ddot r - r \dot \theta^2) = F_1, \frac m2 \frac {d}{dt}(r^2\theta) = F_2,$  and $m\ddot z = F_3$, where now $F = F_1e_r + F_2e_{\theta}+F_3k,$ and $e_r = i\text{cos} \theta + j\text{sin} \theta$ and $e_{\theta} = -i\text{sin}\theta + j \text{cos} \theta$ (see RADIAL AND TRANSVERSE COMPONENTS).
