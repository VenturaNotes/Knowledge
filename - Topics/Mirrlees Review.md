- A review of the UK tax system organized by the Institute for Fiscal Studies under the chairmanship of Sir James Mirrlees (1936-2018). The Mirrlees Review was launched 30 years after the Meade Review and reported in 2011. The recommendations of the Review were founded on the view that taxes and benefits should be designed and judged as a system. From this perspective it recommended the pursuit of neutrality (taxes should not distort choices) for indirect taxes and corporate income taxes, alongside a progressive income tax system. The detailed proposals included removal of value-added tax exemptions and reductions, extension of value-added tax to financial services, the adoption of a flat-rate tax on the value of housing, the alignment of tax rates on income from all sources, the integration of tax and benefit systems, and the exclusion of the risk-free rate of return on capital from tax.
