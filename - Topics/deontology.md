- $n$. an approach to ethics that is concerned with what makes an action inherently right or wrong. Deontology's emphasis on the primacy of observing duties and respecting rights is at odds with the approach that judges actions by their outcomes (see CONSEQUENTIALISM). This tension is central to many issues in medical ethics; for example, in relation to euthanasia, the wrong of killing versus the good outcome of ending suffering, and is further complicated when rights or duties are in conflict with one another, e.g. in relation to abortion, the rights of the mother versus the rights of the fetus. See also Kantian ethics. -deontological adj.
