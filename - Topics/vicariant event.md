- The formation of a physical barrier that splits an existing population into two or more subpopulations and prevents or impedes breeding and hence free interchange of genetic material. Over time, such events lead to the splitting of the original species into two distinct species (see ALLOPATRIC). They include the uplifting of mountain ranges, shifts in the course of rivers, or the separation of continental land masses via movement of tectonic plates.
