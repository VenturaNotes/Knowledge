- A welfare benefit paid in the UK to individuals who are on low incomes or are unemployed. It was introduced in 2013 as a single monthly payment to replace the following benefits: Child Tax Credit, Employment Support and Allowance, housing benefit, Income Support, jobseeker's allowance, and Working Tax Credit.

- a welfare benefit in the UK that is due to replace six mean-tested benefits and tax credits, with the intention of simplifying the benefits system and strengthening incentives to work. Rollout of universal credit began in 2013 and is ongoing with a forecast completion date of 2022. It has been criticized by some for its focus on the centralization of administration, particularly the requirement for most claimants to file claims online rather than face-to-face, as well as for delays to the rollout, which was originally supposed to be complete in 2017.
