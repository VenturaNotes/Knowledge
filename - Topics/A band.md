- The dark band of the muscle [[sarcomere]] that corresponds to the thick myosin (protein) filaments. The A band is situated on either side of the [[H zone]] of a muscle sarcomere, that is the area where contraction and relaxation of the muscle occurs, where sarcomeres overlap during muscle movements
	- Explanation[^2]
		- While sarcomeres exist only in muscle cells, specifying "muscle sarcomere" helps reinforce the context, distinguishing it from other biological structures
		- Here, "muscle" is being used as a noun in an attributive way (also called a [[noun adjunct]]). This means that "muscle" is modifying "sarcomere" to specify that it is a sarcomere found in muscle tissue. It functions similarly to how "chicken soup" uses chicken as a noun describing the type of soup

## Source[^2]
- The "dark band" in a muscle sarcomere refers to the A band, which appears dark under a microscope due to the presence of thick myosin filaments. The density of these filaments causes the region to absorb more light, making it appear darker than surrounding areas
- "A band" is a noun as it is a specific anatomical structure in the muscle sarcomere
- During muscle contraction, the actin (thin) filaments slide over the myosin (thick) filaments, reducing the [[H zone]] and shortening the [[sarcomere]]. This process, called the [[sliding filament theory]], allows muscles to contract and generate force

## Source[^3]
- The region of a striated muscle fibre that contains both thick (myosin) and thin (actin) filaments. It is visible as a dark band with a lighter central zone (see H ZONE) in the middle of a sarcomere.
