- Data lineage is the process of tracking the movement of data over time. Through this process, it is possible to determine the root cause of an issue within the data by looking at where it originated, what happened to it over time, and where it has been. It aims to access the complete data flow, from when it was created to when it was consumed. Because data lineage focuses on accuracy, it allows corporations to track errors, make process changes, execute system migrations, and better understand the overall framework of their data. The process of data lineage helps to improve an organization's data quality.
