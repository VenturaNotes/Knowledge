- $n$. a narrowing of any tubular structure in the body, such as the oesophagus (gullet), biliary tract, bowel, ureter, or urethra. A stricture may result from inflammation, muscular spasm, growth of a tumour within the affected part, or from pressure on it by neighboring organs. For example, a urethral stricture is a fibrous narrowing of the urethra, usually resulting from injury or inflammation. The patient has increasing difficulty in passing urine and may develop urinary retention. The site and length of the stricture is assessed by urethrography and urethroscopy, and treatment is by periodic dilatation of the urethra using sounds, urethrotomy, or urethroplasty. Strictures in the gastrointestinal tract may be dilated by balloons or treated surgically by stricturoplasty or division stricturotomy. Symptomatic malignant strictures can be managed by insertion of a stent to relieve the obstruction, especially in cases of oesophageal, colonic, or biliary strictures.
