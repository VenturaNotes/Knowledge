- (1) A progressive reduction in the price level. This would make real interest rates exceed nominal interest rates, which might make it impossible to lower nominal interest rates during a slump sufficiently to make real investment appear profitable. This is known as the liquidity trap.
- (2) A reduction in activity due to lack of effective demand. This could be brought about deliberately by the monetary authorities in order to reduce inflationary pressure, or could occur through a collapse in confidence which the authorities were unable to avert. See also DEBT DEFLATION.
## Source[^2]
- The situation in which there is a general decrease in prices, especially when this is accompanied by falling levels of output, employment, and trade. Because of these associations, advocates of anti-inflationary policies usually now prefer the term disinflation. Compare INFLATION.
