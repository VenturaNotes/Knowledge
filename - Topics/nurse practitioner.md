- a registered nurse with advanced training and experience who assumes some of the duties and responsibilities formerly assumed only by a physician. Such nurses can practise in hospital or community settings within various domains of clinical activity, which may be condition-specific (e.g. diabetes, breast care), client-specific (e.g. children, the elderly, the homeless), or area-specific (e.g. general practice, dermatology).
