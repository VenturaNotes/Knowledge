- The error caused by truncating numbers in a calculation, usually necessitated because registers in a computer can only hold numbers of a fixed length, say $t$ binary digits. Arithmetical operations on such numbers often give results requiring more than $t$ digits for their representation, which must then be reduced to $t$ digits for further calculation. The nearest $t$-digit approximation may be used (rounding) or digits after the $t$ th may be dropped (chopping or [[truncation]]). The repeated reduction to $t$ digits can cause systematic buildup of error in certain types of calculation.
