- Numerical methods in which randomly generated numbers play a part in the calculations. A probabilistic model is constructed, corresponding to the mathematical or physical problem, and random samples are taken within the model. By taking more samples, a more accurate estimate of the result is obtained. Such methods are used for example on problems in particle physics, evaluation of multiple integrals, traffic problems, and large-scale operational problems generally. See also STOCHASTIC PROCESS.
