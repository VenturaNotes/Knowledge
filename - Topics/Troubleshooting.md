- Troubleshooting is a systematic approach used to solve a problem. The troubleshooting process aims to uncover why something is not working as expected and explain how the issue should be resolved. The first step to troubleshooting is to identify the issue. The second step is to collect the information needed to fully understand why the issue occurred. Next, the relevant information about the issue should be analyzed to determine its root cause. Once the root cause is identified, then a solution should be proposed and tested. Once an appropriate solution is found, the solution can be used to troubleshoot the problem, fixing the issue at hand.
