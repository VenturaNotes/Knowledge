### Truth Table

| $p$ | $q$ | $p \implies q$ |
| --- | --- | -------------- |
| T   | T   | T              |
| $\textcolor{hotpink}{T}$   | $\textcolor{hotpink}{F}$   | $\textcolor{hotpink}{F}$          |
| F   | T   | T              |
| F   | F   | T              |

- Only false when $p$ is true and $q$ is false
- Implications are also called conditional statements [^2]
## Source[^3]
### Negation
- Example
	- $\lnot (p \implies q)$ $\iff$ $p \land \lnot q$ 
## Source [^4]
### Equivalences
- $p \implies q$ is logically equivalent to $\lnot p \lor q$
