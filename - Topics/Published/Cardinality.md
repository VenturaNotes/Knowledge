## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
- Denoted
	- $|B| = 4$
	- $n(B) =4$
	- $\# B = 4$

## Source[^2]
- Can be written as
	- $|A \cup B|$
	- $n (A \cup B)$
## Source[^3]
- Formula for [[intersection of sets]]
	- $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$

## Source[^4]
- $P = \{p | \text{ p is a prime} \}$
	- |P| = $\infty$
