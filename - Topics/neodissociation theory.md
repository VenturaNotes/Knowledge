- $n$. A leading interpretation of hypnosis, first proposed in 1973 in an article in the journal Psychological Review by the US psychologist Ernest R(opiequit) Hilgard (1904-2001), according to which hypnosis involves a form of divided consciousness, as in hypnotic analgesia, when a hypnotized person is unaware of the pain being caused by a stimulus that would normally be painful but the hidden observer is aware of the pain; or in hypnotic amnesia, in which a person who has recently been hypnotized is unable to recall what happened during the hypnotic session. It is called neodissociation theory to distinguish it from dissociation theory. See also dissociation.
