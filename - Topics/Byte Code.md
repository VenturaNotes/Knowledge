- Byte code is a type of program code that is compiled and executed on a computer system called a virtual machine (VM). Programmers use byte code in its original form on any platform on which the VM operates, which makes it platform-independent. It is also intermediate, which means it falls somewhere between source code and machine code in its capabilities. Byte code is also referred to as portable code or p-code.
