## Source [^1]
- an approach to ethical problems and practice that involves listening to and interpreting people's stories rather than applying principles or rules to particular situations. This context-specific empathetic approach to patient and professional life stories is often contrasted with the universalizing rationalist approach of Kantian ethics. Narrative ethics has an obvious relevance to the doctor-patient relationship and mirrors the clinical context in which moral choices are made.
