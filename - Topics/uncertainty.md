- (1) The uncertainty about a piece of knowledge in a knowledge base can be represented in a variety of ways. The most popular is to attach a number to the fact or rule, e.g. 1 for complete truth, 0 for complete falsity, $3 / 4$ for likely. Sometimes these numbers are intended to be the probability of the knowledge being true. Reasoning systems must assign an inferred uncertainty value to an inferred piece of knowledge. See also CERTAINTY FACTOR.

- A consciousness of limited knowledge about present facts or future possibilities. There is a formal distinction between risk and uncertainty: risk applies when probabilities can be assigned to the likely occurrence of future outcomes; uncertainty applies when probabilities cannot be assigned. Used in this sense, decisions with risk permit the application of expected utility. In contrast, expected utility does not apply in the case of uncertainty, and so a more general theory of choice has to be constructed. More commonly, risk and uncertainty are used interchangeably.
