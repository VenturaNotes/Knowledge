- The amount of interest applicable to a particular loan or deposit before tax is deducted. Interest rates may be quoted gross (as they are on government securities) or net (as in most building society deposits or bank deposits). The gross interest less the tax deducted at the basic rate of income tax gives the net interest. Any tax suffered is usually, but not always, available as a credit against tax liabilities.
