- $n$. imaging of a fistula. X-rays can be used to visualize the fistula after injection of a radiopaque contrast medium, usually through an opening in the skin after inserting a catheter, to see the extent of a fistula and the structures with which it communicates. In haemodialysis patients, contrast is injected through a needle into the vessels around the surgical fistula to look for blockages or narrowings that are compromising flow. Magnetic resonance imaging is the procedure of choice for examining fistulae around the rectum and anus.
