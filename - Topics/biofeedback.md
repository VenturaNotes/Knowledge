- $n$. the giving of immediate information to a subject about his or her bodily processes (such as heart rate), which are usually unconscious, by means of monitoring devices. This may enable some voluntary control over such processes. These processes can then be subject to operant conditioning. This is an experimental treatment for disturbances of bodily regulation, such as hypertension.
## Source[^2]
- The technique whereby a subject can learn to control certain body functions, such as heart rate or blood pressure, that are usually unconsciously regulated by the autonomic nervous system. It is facilitated by the use of monitoring devices, such as pulse monitors, electroencephalographs, and electromyographs, and can be useful in treating high blood pressure, migraine, epilepsy, and other disorders.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A technique whereby a person learns to control a normally involuntary autonomic response (such as blood pressure, heart rate, or alpha wave EEG activity) by attending to the output of a device that monitors the response continuously (such as a blood pressure monitor, an electrocardiograph, or an electroencephalograph, respectively). It is sometimes used to treat stress disorders such as migraine headaches, hypertension, and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. It can be traced back to an experiment carried out by the US medical psychologist Joe Kamiya (born 1925), who in 1958 trained a volunteer to recognize and increase his output of alpha wave brain activity. In 1965, the US neurobiologist M(aurice) Barry Sterman (born 1935) used operant conditioning techniques to train cats to increase sensorimotor rhythm activity, and he later discovered that, when these cats were exposed to toxic rocket fuel, they responded significantly less often with seizures and had better survival rates than cats that had not had such training. This led to the clinical application of similar methods to reduce seizures in patients with epilepsy and other disorders. \[From Greek bios life + English feedback]
