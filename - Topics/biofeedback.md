- $n$. the giving of immediate information to a subject about his or her bodily processes (such as heart rate), which are usually unconscious, by means of monitoring devices. This may enable some voluntary control over such processes. These processes can then be subject to operant conditioning. This is an experimental treatment for disturbances of bodily regulation, such as hypertension.
## Source[^2]
- The technique whereby a subject can learn to control certain body functions, such as heart rate or blood pressure, that are usually unconsciously regulated by the autonomic nervous system. It is facilitated by the use of monitoring devices, such as pulse monitors, electroencephalographs, and electromyographs, and can be useful in treating high blood pressure, migraine, epilepsy, and other disorders.
