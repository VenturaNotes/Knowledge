- A retail facility whereby shoppers order products online ('click') and pick them up from a designated physical location ('collect'). This multi-channel approach can offer advantages both to consumers, who are able to collect products at their convenience rather than waiting in to have them delivered at home, and to retailers, who gain access to a broad network of outlets such as convenience stores. In the UK click and collect grew in popularity in the early 2000s.
