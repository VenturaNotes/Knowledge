- (reduction division) $n$. a type of cell division that produces four daughter cells, each having half the number of chromosomes of the original cell. It occurs before the formation of sperm and ova and the normal (diploid) number of chromosomes is restored after fertilization. Meiosis also produces genetic variation in the daughter cells, brought about by the process of crossing over. Meiosis consists of two successive divisions, each divided into four stages (see PROPHASE; METAPHASE; ANAPHASE; TELOPHASE). (See illustration.) Compare MITOSIS. â€”meiotic adj.
