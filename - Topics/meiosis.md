- Meiosis does not increase the number of chromosomes in a cell
## Source[^2]
- Cell division that results in the production of gametes, or sex cells
## Source[^3]
- (reduction division) $n$. a type of cell division that produces four daughter cells, each having half the number of chromosomes of the original cell. It occurs before the formation of sperm and ova and the normal (diploid) number of chromosomes is restored after fertilization. Meiosis also produces genetic variation in the daughter cells, brought about by the process of crossing over. Meiosis consists of two successive divisions, each divided into four stages (see PROPHASE; METAPHASE; ANAPHASE; TELOPHASE). (See illustration.) Compare MITOSIS. â€”meiotic adj.

- (reduction division) A type of nuclear division that gives rise to four reproductive cells (gametes) each with half the chromosome number of the parent cell. Two consecutive divisions occur. In the first, homologous chromosomes become paired and may exchange genetic material (see crossing OVER) before moving away from each other into separate daughter nuclei. This is the actual reduction division because each of the two nuclei so formed contains only half of the original chromosomes. The daughter nuclei then divide by mitosis and four haploid cells are produced. See also PROPHASE; METAPHASE; ANAPHASE; TELOPHASE.

## Source[^5]
- $n$. 
- (1) A form of cell division such as that of gametes in sexually reproducing species in which the nucleus divides into four daughter nuclei each containing half the chromosomes of the parent nucleus (see illustration). It consists of two successive divisions: during the first, homologous chromosomes pair up, exchange genetic material by crossing over, then during the anaphase part of the cycle move apart by disjunction (1) to form separate haploid nuclei; during the second phase these daughter nuclei divide by mitosis (with a further anaphase), producing four haploid cells. Also called reduction division. Compare mitosis. 
- (2) A figure of speech characterized by understatement or litotes. meiotic adj. \[From Greek meiosis diminution, from meion less + -osis indicating a process or state]
