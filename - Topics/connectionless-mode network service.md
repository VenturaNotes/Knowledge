## Source [^1]
- A network in which each packet of information between a source and destination travels independently of any other packets. In practice, many networks are capable of operating in either a connectionless or a connection-oriented mode, and the choice of which approach is adopted rests as much with the designer of the protocols as with the actual hardware of the network. See also DATAGRAM.
