## Source [^1]
- The metabolic pathway followed in the light-independent phase of photosynthesis by most plants of temperate regions, in which the first product is the three-carbon compound glycerate 3-phosphate. This is formed when carbon dioxide combines with ribulose bisphosphate in the first reaction of the Calvin-Bassham-Benson cycle. Plants that follow this pathway are referred to as $\mathbf{C}_{3}$ plants. Compare C.
