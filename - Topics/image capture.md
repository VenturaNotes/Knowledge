- (image acquisition) The process of obtaining a digital image from a vision sensor, such as a video camera. Usually this entails a hardware interface known as a frame grabber, which captures single frames of video, converts the analogue values to digital, and feeds the result into the computer memory. The conversion process is often accompanied with image compression.
