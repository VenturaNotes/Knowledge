- (1744-1829) French natural historian. In 1778 he published a flora of France, which included a dichotomous identification key, and later worked on the classification of invertebrates, published in a seven-volume natural history (1815-22). In 1809 he put forward a theory of evolution that has become known as Lamarckism (later rejected in favor of Darwinism).
