- a variety of mechanisms that help to ensure that the genetic sequence, as expressed in the DNA, is maintained and that errors that occur during DNA replication, by mutation, are not allowed to accumulate. An error in the genetic sequence could cause cell death by interfering with the replication process. DNA repair involves the action of enzymes, which detect damage to DNA and effect the repair. Some genetic diseases, including ataxia telangiectasia and xeroderma pigmentosum, are due to deficiencies in these enzymes.
