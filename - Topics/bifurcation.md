- A splitting in two. The term can be applied in computing in various ways.
- (1) Bifurcation is the generic name for a collection of algorithms that initially convert a decision table into a tree structure, which can then be systematically encoded to produce a program.
- The bifurcation method involves choosing some condition $C$ and eliminating it from the decision table to produce two subtables, one corresponding to the case when $C$ is true and the other to when $C$ is false. The method is then applied recursively to the two subtables. From this approach a decision tree can be built, each node of the tree representing a condition and subtrees representing subtables; leaf nodes identify rules. 
- (2) Bifurcation theory is the theory of equilibrium solutions of nonlinear differential equations; an equilibrium solution is a steady solution, a time periodic, or a quasi-periodic solution. Generally bifurcation points are points at which branches and therefore multiple solutions appear.

- The values of a parameter at which the nature of an equilibrium or attractor changes in a dynamical system. Commonly, a stable equilibrium might become unstable but bifurcate (i.e. split) into two stable equilibria. See LOGISTIC MAP.
