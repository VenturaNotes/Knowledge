- $n$. A network of passages and blind alleys, either a simple T-maze or a more intricate labyrinth, introduced into psychology in an article in the American Journal of Psychology in 1901 by the US psychologist Willard Stanton Small (1870-1943) for studying animal learning and behavior, a reward usually being provided for an organism that solves the maze and finds the goal box. Small constructed his original maze, which he used for studying 'the mental processes of the rat', as an exact replica in miniature of the famous garden maze at Hampton Court in Richmond-upon-Thames, England. \[From Old English amasian to amaze]
