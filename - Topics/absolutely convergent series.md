- A series $\left\{a_{n}\right\}$ is said to be absolutely convergent if $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|$ is convergent. Absolutely convergent series are convergent. If $a_{n}=(-1)^{n-1} \times \frac{1}{n}$ then the series is convergent but not absolutely convergent, whereas $a_{n}=(-1)^{n-1} \times \frac{1}{n^{2}}$ is absolutely convergent. A series which is convergent but not absolutely convergent is called conditionally convergent.
