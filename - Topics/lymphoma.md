- $n$. cancer of the lymph nodes, including Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. There is a broad spectrum of malignancy, with prognosis ranging from a few months to many years. The patient usually shows evidence of multiple enlarged lymph nodes and may have constitutional symptoms such as weight loss, fever, and sweating (the socalled 'B symptoms'). Disease may be widespread, but in some cases is confined to a single area, which may be extranodal (such as the tonsil). Treatment is with drugs such as chlorambucil or combinations of cyclophosphamide, vincristine, and prednisolone, sometimes with the addition of doxorubicin and/or bleomycin; response to these drugs is often dramatic. New targeted agents are used depending on the expression of cell surface molecules, particularly rituximab against CD20 in diffuse Bcell lymphoma. Localized disease may be treated with radiotherapy followed by drugs. Patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma who do not respond to chemotherapy may be considered for a bone-marrow transplant.
