- (single photon emission computing tomography) (in nuclear medicine) a cross-sectional imaging technique for observing an organ or part of the body using a gamma camera; images are produced after injecting a radioactive tracer. The camera is rotated around the patient being scanned. Using a computer reconstruction algorithm similar to that of a computerized tomography scanner, multiple 'slices' are made through the area of interest. SPECT scanning is used particularly in cardiac nuclear medicine imaging (see MUGA SCAN). It differs from PET scanning in that radioactive decay gives off only a single gamma ray.
