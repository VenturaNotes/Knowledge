- $n$. An interconnected system of cortical areas that are active in a person who is in a state of wakeful rest, daydreaming, reminiscing, or contemplating future events, but not focused on a specific task involving the processing of external sensory (especially visual) input. It includes the parahippocampal gyrus, the medial prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate gyrus, the angular gyrus, and the medial, lateral, and inferior parietal lobe, and it is characterized by low-frequency EEG waves at about 0.1 Hz (one oscillation every 10 seconds). The term was introduced by the US neurologist Marcus E. Raichle (born 1937) and several collaborators in an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences in 2001. Also called the default network or the task-negative network. Compare TASK-POSITIVE NETWORK. DMN abbrev.
