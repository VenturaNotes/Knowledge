- The artery in vertebrate embryos that transports blood from the aortic arches to the trunk and limbs. In adult fish it is a major artery that carries oxygenated blood from the efferent branchial arteries to branches that supply the body organs; in adult tetrapods it arises from the systemic arch (see AORTA). Compare VENTRAL AORTA.
