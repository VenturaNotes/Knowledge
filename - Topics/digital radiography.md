- (DR) an alternative to film radiography, by acquiring X-ray images from a large number of individual X-ray detectors on a matrix in a digital format directly. This contrasts with computerized radiography, in which an analogue image is taken and then put into a reader to be converted into a digital image. The technique allows the storage of images and their subsequent retrieval, manipulation, and interpretation using computers (see PACS).
