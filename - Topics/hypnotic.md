- (soporific) $n$. a drug that produces sleep by depressing brain function. Hypnotics include benzodiazepines (such as loprazolam, nitrazepam, and temazepam) and drugs that act at benzodiazepine receptor sites, such as zaleplon, zolpidem, and zopiclone. Hypnotics are used for the short-term treatment of insomnia and sleep disturbances. Some of them (e.g. nitrazepam, flurazepam) may cause hangover effects in the morning.
