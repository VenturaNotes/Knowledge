- (Mexican peso crisis, Tequilla crisis) A financial crisis in Mexico that started with the devaluation of the peso by about 50 per cent against the US dollar in December 1994. This was followed by a deep recession, with GDP contracting by 6.2 per cent in 1995. With the assistance of a bail out package arranged by the US government and administered by the International Monetary Fund, the economy had largely recovered by 1998.
