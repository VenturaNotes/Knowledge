- (cGMP) Cyclic guanosine monophosphate: a derivative of the nucleotide guanosine triphosphate (GTP) that, like cyclic AMP, acts as a second messenger in signalling pathways within cells. Formed from GTP by the enzyme guanylate cyclase, cyclic GMP activates protein kinase G, which in turn activates specific intracellular proteins by phosphorylation. Cyclic GMP is found in most animal cells; one of its key roles is in rod cells of the retina, where it regulates light-dependent opening and closing of ion channels in the rod-cell plasma membrane (see TRANSDUCIN).
## Source[^2]
- n. Cyclic guanosine monophosphate, a compound that is analogous to cyclic AMP and that keeps sodium channels open in the outer membranes of rods and cones in the retina when its ring structure is intact, but is inactivated by transducin if stimulated by light, closing the sodium channels and triggering action potentials. It also relaxes the smooth muscles in the walls of arteries in the penis, causing the arteries to dilate and tending to constrict veins, its secretion increasing in response to sexual excitement and affecting the corpora cavernosa and the corpus spongiosum of the penis or clitoris, facilitating the inflow and reducing the outflow of blood into the erectile tissue. See also phosphodiesterase type 5, Viagra. cGMP abbrev.
