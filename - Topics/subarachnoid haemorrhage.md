- sudden bleeding into the subarachnoid space surrounding the brain, which causes severe headache with stiffness of the neck. The usual source of such a haemorrhage is a cerebral aneurysm that has burst. The diagnosis is confirmed by CT scan or by finding bloodstained cerebrospinal fluid at lumbar puncture. Identification of the site of the aneurysm, upon which decisions about treatment will be based, is achieved by cerebral angiography.
