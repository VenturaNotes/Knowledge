- A form of debt discounting for exporters in which a forfaiter accepts at a discount, and without recourse, a promissory note, bill of exchange, letter of credit, etc., received from a foreign buyer by an exporter. Maturities are normally from one to three years. Thus the exporter receives payment without risk at the cost of the discount.
