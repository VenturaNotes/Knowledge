- $n$. A technique of market research, popular in the US and the UK since the 1990s, in which specially trained assessors called mystery shoppers (in the retail industry) or more generally mystery customers visit stores, restaurants, banks, or other businesses in which service quality is to be appraised and, posing as ordinary customers, check the attainment of service standards drawn up in consultation with the client company. Examples of service standards that might be assessed include the following: Did the cashier deal with me courteously? Did the sales assistant check that I had the right size garment? Was a pool table provided in the pub? Was I served within two minutes? Did the bank teller smile? Were the ashtrays emptied regularly? From the results of such a survey, the standard attained by a client company can be compared with that of its competitors. \[So called because of the secrecy regarding which customers are assessors]
