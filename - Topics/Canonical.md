- Canonical is a term that describes an entity that adheres to an original set of rules, criteria, and principles. This term is commonly used to determine whether a programming interface follows a certain standard or precedent or whether it deviates from it. The process for converting data that has more than one possible representation into a standard (canonical) form is called canonicalization.
