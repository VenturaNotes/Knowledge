- A negatively charged ion (more electrons)

## Source[^2]
- anion $n$. an ion of negative charge, such as a bicarbonate ion $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$or a chloride ion $\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$(See also Electrolyte). The anion gap is the difference between the concentrations of cations (positively charged ions) and anions, calculated from the formula:$$\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}+\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)-\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}+\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$$It is used to estimate the unaccounted-for anions in the blood in cases of metabolic disturbance. The normal anion gap is $12-16 \mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$.
