- A one-byte character set consisting of the ASCII character set (positions 0-127 ) with additional characters assigned to positions 128-255. These characters may include special symbols, graphics characters, and accented characters. The assignment of extended ASCII characters is not standard. It depends on the particular computer system and may also depend on the font being used. Such character sets have largely been superseded by Unicode.
