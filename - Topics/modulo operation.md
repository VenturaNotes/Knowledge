- An arithmetic operation in which the result is the remainder after one integer is divided by another. Hence $$i\text{ modulo } j \text{ or } i \bmod j$$is the remainder of the division of integer $i$ by integer $j$. The exact definition of the operation, when the integers may be negative, is not defined. See also MODULAR ARITHMETIC.
