- The relative importance attached to various components entering into any index number. The weights are chosen according to the purpose for which it is expected that an index number will be used. The weights in a consumer price index, for example, are chosen so that the bundle of goods and services whose prices are measured corresponds to what an average consumer would buy. These weights are based on surveys of consumer behavior.
