- $n$. The use of information gained through one sensory modality to interpret information gained from another, as when a person born blind acquires the power of vision late in life, usually through a surgical operation, and immediately recognizes familiar objects by sight alone. In 1690 the English empiricist philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) expressed the opinion in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding (Book 2, Chapter 9, section 8) that such a person would not at first recognize any objects by sight alone, but in 1963 the case of SB reported by the English psychologists Richard L(angton) Gregory (1923-2010) and his research assistant Jean G. Wallace clearly refuted Locke's view and showed that cross-modal transfer had occurred, SB being able, immediately after his eye operation in middle age, to read upper-case letters and numerals that he had learnt only through touch. Also called cross-modality transfer. See also Molyneux's question.
