- (Frankfurt Wertpapierbörse) The oldest and largest of eight regional stock exchanges in Germany, accounting for more than $75 \%$ of equity trading in Germany. It first recorded trading in 1820 and was subsequently recognized as a center for dealing in bonds. Trading is now on four markets; the Amtlicher Handel for Government bonds and major companies, the Geregelter Markt for smaller companies, the Freiverkehr, or third market, and the Neuer Markt, launched in 1997 for companies involved in Internet trading. Prices are determined on an auction basis by the official brokers (Kursmakler) and free brokers (Freimakler), who base them on buying and selling orders from the banks. The main market indicator is the Deutsche Aktienindex (DAX index). The exchange is owned by Deutsche Börse.
