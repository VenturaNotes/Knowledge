- A legally binding agreement under which parties can agree to end an employment relationship on specified terms, usually including a payment by the employer to the employee. The validity of such agreements is governed by the Employment Rights Act 1996. They must be in writing and the employee must have received independent advice from an appropriate person (e.g. a lawyer or trade union official). The effect of the agreement is that the employee waives his right to make a claim to the employment tribunal on the matters covered in the agreement. An employer who improperly pressures an employee into entering a settlement agreement should be aware that this can amount to constructive dismissal. Guidance is provided in a statutory ACAS Code of Practice.
