- In law, a tort in which a breach of a duty of care results in damage to the person to whom the duty is owed. Such a duty is owed by manufacturers to the consumers who buy their products, by accountants, solicitors, doctors, and other professional persons to their clients, by a director of a company to its shareholders, etc. A person who has suffered loss or injury as a result of a breach of the duty of care can claim damages in tort. The risk of being sued for negligence makes it essential for partners in firms that are not limited liability partnerships to obtain professional indemnity insurance.
