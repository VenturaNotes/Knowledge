- The term oligopoly describes a market structure in which a small number of large corporations set standards to control the price of their products and services, preventing new competitors from entering their market sector.
- In this type of market structure, companies choose to coexist with each other instead of competing, as this ensures price stability within the market and increases the potential to receive large profits.
- In an oligopoly, firms utilize non-price competition, which focuses on benefits, product quality, and extra services to outsell their competition, rather than lowering prices. Examples of industries that are considered oligopolies include the steel, telecommunications, oil, railroad, and airline industries.
