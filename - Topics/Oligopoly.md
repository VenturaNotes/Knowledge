- The term oligopoly describes a market structure in which a small number of large corporations set standards to control the price of their products and services, preventing new competitors from entering their market sector.
- In this type of market structure, companies choose to coexist with each other instead of competing, as this ensures price stability within the market and increases the potential to receive large profits.
- In an oligopoly, firms utilize non-price competition, which focuses on benefits, product quality, and extra services to outsell their competition, rather than lowering prices. Examples of industries that are considered oligopolies include the steel, telecommunications, oil, railroad, and airline industries.

- A market in which relatively few sellers supply many buyers. Each seller recognizes that prices can be controlled to a certain extent and that competitors' actions will influence profits. There is therefore a risk of collusion. An oligopoly is often defined as a market in which the four largest players have a combined market share of over $40 \%$ (see FOUR-FIRM CONCENTRATION RATIO). See also MONOPOLY.

- A market supplied by a small number of firms in which the choice of one firm affects the profits of the other firms. The firms are linked by strategic interaction, so market equilibrium is determined by the outcome of strategic considerations. In Cournot oligopoly the strategic variable for each firm is output level. In Bertrand oligopoly the strategic variable is price. The firms in an oligopoly can also engage in non-price competition through product specifications or advertising. The standard analysis of oligopoly represents the market as a game and computes the Nash equilibrium. The properties of the Nash equilibrium are dependent on the precise specification of the game played between firms. See also BERTRAND COMPETITION; COURNOT COMPETITION; MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION.
