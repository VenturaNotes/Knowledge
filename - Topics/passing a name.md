- The disclosure by a firm of brokers of the name of the principal for whom they are acting. In some commodity trades, if brokers disclose the names of their buyers to the sellers, they do not guarantee the buyers' solvency, although they may do so in some circumstances. However, if brokers do not pass their principals' names, it is usual for them to guarantee their solvency. Thus, to remain anonymous, a buyer may have to pay an additional brokerage.
