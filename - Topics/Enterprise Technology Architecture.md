- Enterprise technology architecture (ETA) refers to the guidelines, rules, or standards an organization has for its IT infrastructure. Having an ETA means new software, hardware, or innovations are deployed in line with company guidelines. This helps all parts of IT systems work together. It also ensures nothing is added that doesn't work toward the company vision or goals. ETA drives what a company should buy or invest in as it expands its technology assets.
