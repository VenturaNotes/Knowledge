- One of a range of IP addresses set aside for use within private networks by RFC1918 for IPv4 and RFC4193 for IPv6. Private addresses are not globally unique, so must not be connected directly to the Internet. Routers will normally never route packet using private IP addresses over internetworks. A proxy or network address translation is normally used to give computers with private addresses access to the Internet.
