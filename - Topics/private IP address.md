- One of a range of IP addresses set aside for use within private networks by RFC1918 for IPv4 and RFC4193 for IPv6. Private addresses are not globally unique, so must not be connected directly to the Internet. Routers will normally never route packet using private IP addresses over internetworks. A proxy or network address translation is normally used to give computers with private addresses access to the Internet.

- A private IP address is the IP address a network router assigns to a computer device. Computers within the same network are assigned unique private IP addresses so that they can communicate with each other over the same internal network. Private IP addresses are non-internet facing. In other words, they let devices that are connected to the same network communicate with each other without accessing the internet. This makes it difficult for external computer users to establish a connection to a specific network, such as a corporation’s private network. Private IP addresses can only be traced by other devices on the local network, so unlike public IP addresses, they can’t be located online. Corporate networks often use private IP addresses to prevent external hosts from connecting to their network and to restrict employee internet access, increasing network security.
