- An obsolete type of impact line printer in which the type font was etched or engraved upon metal slugs that were pushed around a guide track. It was introduced by IBM in 1965 to supersede the chain printer. The track guided the slugs around a loop, one section of which ran parallel to the line to be printed. Speeds of up to 3000 lpm were achieved.
- Train printers dominated the high-speed printer market up to 1982, when the band printer offered superior performance at lower cost and nonimpact printers with superior print quality and versatility became financially viable.
