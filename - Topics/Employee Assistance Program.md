- An employee assistance program (EAP) is a benefit program that helps employees personally and professionally. An EAP provides confidential help with various issues, such as substance abuse, emotional distress caused by major life events, occupational stress, financial and healthcare concerns, and personal relationship issues, among other concerns. However, most now cover a broad range of issues such as child care, elder care, relationship challenges, legal problems, and mental wellness matters.
