- In the USA, a bond in which a debt is secured by a real asset (land or property). Senior mortgage bonds have first claim on assets and junior mortgage bonds are subordinate. A mortgage bond may have a closed-end provision, which prevents an organization issuing further bonds of a similar nature on the same asset or open-end provision, which permits further issues with the same status.
