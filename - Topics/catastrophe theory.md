- $n$. A mathematical theory, developed by the French mathematician René Frédéric Thom (1923-2002) and first published in 1972, devoted to the classification of surfaces according to their shape. Aspects of the theory that describe abrupt changes occurring when gradually changing variables reach critical points, as when the locus of a point moving along the topmost fold of a smoothly folded surface suddenly drops to the surface below, have been used to model psychological phenomena such as gradually increasing anger abruptly erupting into a temper tantrum.
