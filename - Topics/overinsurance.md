- The practice of insuring an item for a greater amount than its value. This is pointless as insurers are only obliged to pay the full value (usually the replacement value) of an insured item and no more, even if the sum insured exceeds this value. If insurers find a policyholder has overinsured an item, the premium for the cover above the true value is returned.
