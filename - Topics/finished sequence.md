- (in bioinformatics) A high-quality determination of the base sequence of a chromosome or genome that conforms to an agreed level of accuracy. It corrects and refines the draft sequence using various experimental approaches and data analyses. These steps involve repeated rounds of cloning, sequencing, and assembly until gaps are closed and incorrectly ordered fragments are reassembled. The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium took a further three years to produce the finished sequence of the human genome, following publication of the draft sequence in 2000. It allows for an average of only a single error in every 10,000 bases.
