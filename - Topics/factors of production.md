- The resources required to produce economic goods. They are land (including all natural resources), labour (including all human work and skill), capital (including all money, assets, machinery, raw materials, etc.), and entrepreneurial ability (including organizational and management skills, inventiveness, and the willingness to take risks). For each of these factors there is a price, i.e. rent for land, wages for labour, interest for capital, and profit for the entrepreneur.
