- A situation in which a decision-maker knows the possible future events that may occur but does not know what probability to assign to each event. It can be modeled by assuming the decision-maker knows what probability distributions over events are possible and assigns a probability to each distribution. An example of ambiguity is the following. Assume that the possible future events are high inflation or low inflation. The decision-maker knows that two probability distributions are possible: either a 60 per cent chance of high inflation (and a 40 per cent chance of low inflation) or a 30 per cent chance of high inflation (and a 70 per cent chance of low), and assigns a 50 per cent chance to each of these distributions. Ambiguity falls between ignorance (no probability distributions are ruled out) and risk (there is a unique probability distribution). See also BEHAVIOURAL ECONOMICS.
