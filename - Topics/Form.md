- (1) A page of printer media. It may be a single sheet or a multipart set, i.e. a number of sheets coated so that a single impact will produce similar marks on all sheets. The sheets may be joined to form a continuous web, with sprocket holes at the edges to allow automatic feeding through printers. The paper may be preprinted with headings, fixed information, and lines or boxes. Preprinted single sheets are commonly used with laser printers and inkjet printers. 
- (2) The data structure within a computer system representing the final result to be printed or displayed.
