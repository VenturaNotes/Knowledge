- n. a genus of Gram-negative, generally motile, rodlike bacteria that have the ability to ferment carbohydrates, usually with production of gas, and are found in the intestines of humans and many animals. E. coli - a lactose-fermenting species - is usually not harmful but some strains cause gastrointestinal infections. Ingestion of the pathogenic serotype E. coli O157, derived from infected meat, causes colitis with bloody diarrhoea, which may give rise to the complications of haemolytic uraemic syndrome or thrombocytopenic purpura (see also FOOD POISONING). E. coli is widely used in laboratory experiments for bacteriological and genetic studies.
