- The documents that an exporter of goods delivers to a bank in the exporting country in order to obtain payment for the goods. The bank sends them to its branch or agents in the importing country, who only release them to the importer against payment. Once the importer has these documents, the goods can be claimed at the port of destination. The documents usually consist of a commercial invoice, bill of lading, insurance policy or certificate, weight note, quality certificate, and, if required, a certificate of origin, consular invoice, and export licence.
