- $n$. A popular test for the detection and characterization of color-blindness or color deficiency, consisting of a series of colored plates each composed of small blobs of different colors closely packed together, each plate having a large numeral clearly visible to viewers with normal color vision but invisible to those with a form of color deficiency associated with that plate, the pattern of responses across the complete set of plates enabling the form of color deficiency to be specified reasonably precisely. See also pseudo-isochromatic. Compare Holmgren test, Stilling test. \[Named after the Japanese ophthalmologist Shinobu Ishihara (1897-1963) who devised it]
