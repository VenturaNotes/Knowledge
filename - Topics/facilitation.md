- $n$. 
- (1) (in neurology) the phenomenon that occurs when a neuron receives, through a number of different synapses, impulses that are not powerful enough individually to start an action potential but whose combined activity brings about some depolarization of the membrane. In this facilitated state any small additional depolarization will suffice to trigger off an impulse in the cell. 
- (2) (in education and group therapy) the process of running, leading, or controlling a group discussion.
