- Attrition refers to employee departure from a company for any reason. Departures may be voluntary or involuntary, including resignation, firing, death, or retirement. Attrition is a natural process that occurs over the course of normal business operations. Organizations may welcome a certain amount of attrition if they want to slowly downsize or reduce their staffing budget. In this case, the roles of departed employees may go unfilled for a while or be eliminated.
