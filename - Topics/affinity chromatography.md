## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A type of chromatography that is dependent on the affinity between specific molecules. The matrix, which can be packed into a column, is made from a material that is able to specifically bind to the molecule under investigation. Antibody purification can be achieved by this method when an appropriate antigen is bound to the matrix. In addition, components of protein complexes can be isolated and purified using this technique, for analysis by mass spectrometry.
