## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A type of chromatography that is dependent on the affinity between specific molecules. The matrix, which can be packed into a column, is made from a material that is able to specifically bind to the molecule under investigation. Antibody purification can be achieved by this method when an appropriate antigen is bound to the matrix. In addition, components of protein complexes can be isolated and purified using this technique, for analysis by mass spectrometry.
## Source[^2]
- A biochemical technique for purifying natural polymers, especially proteins. It functions by attaching a specific ligand by covalent bonding to an insoluble inert support. The ligand has to have a specific affinity for the polymer, so that when a solution containing the ligand is passed down a column of the material it is specifically retarded and thus separated from any contaminating molecules. An example of a suitable ligand is the substrate of an enzyme, provided that it does not change irreversibly during the chromatography.
