- a Schneiderian first-rank symptom in which a person believes that a normal percept (product of perception) has a special meaning for him or her. For example, a cloud in the sky may be misinterpreted as meaning that someone has sent that person a message to save the world. While the symptom is particularly indicative of schizophrenia, it also occurs in other psychoses, including mania (in which it often has grandiose undertones).
