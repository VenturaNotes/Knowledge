- a branch of radiology in which complex procedures are performed using imaging guidance, which avoids patients having to undergo invasive surgery to achieve the same results. This is often termed 'pinhole surgery'. Guidance is commonly by X-ray fluoroscopy, ultrasound, or computerized tomography, and recently also by magnetic resonance imaging. Procedures commonly performed include angioplasty and stenting of vascular structures, drainage of fluid collections or abscesses, stenting of obstructions to the gastrointestinal tract, embolization, cryotherapy, and radiofrequency ablation.
