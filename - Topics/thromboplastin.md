## Source [^1]
- (tissue factor, Factor III, thrombokinase) $n$. a substance formed during the earlier stages of blood coagulation. It acts as an enzyme, converting the inactive substance prothrombin to the enzyme thrombin.
## Source[^2]
- (tissue factor; Factor III) A membrane glycoprotein expressed on the surface of damaged tissue cells that initiates the cascade of reactions leading to formation of a blood clot. It forms a complex with Factor VIIa in the presence of phospholipid and calcium ions; this complex converts Factor X to Xa , which in turn converts prothrombin to thrombin. See blood Clotting.
