- The interests of the community. If a contract is (on common-law principles) contrary to public policy, this will normally make it an illegal contract. In a few cases, however, such a contract is void but not illegal, and is treated slightly more leniently (for example, by severance). Contracts that are illegal because they contravene public policy include any contract to commit a crime or a tort or to defraud the revenue, any contract that prejudices national safety or the administration of justice, and any immoral contract. Contracts that are merely void include contracts in restraint of trade.
