- $n$. The area round a person's or an animal's body into which other people or conspecifics (1) may not normally intrude without provoking a negative reaction. In special circumstances, such as crowded situations, contact sports, or sexually intimate interactions, invasions of personal space need not cause negative reactions. See also proxemics.
