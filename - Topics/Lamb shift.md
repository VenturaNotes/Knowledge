- A small energy difference between two energy levels of an atom, which the Dirac equation predicts should be degenerate. The existence of the Lamb shift was conclusively demonstrated by Willis Eugene Lamb in 1947, in the case of $^2S_\frac 12$ and $^2P_\frac 12$ levels in the hydrogen spectrum. The shift occurs because of interactions between atomic electrons and the electromagnetic field, which can be calculated very accurately using quantum electrodynamics.
