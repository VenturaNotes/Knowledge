- $n$. the bone of the upper arm (see illustration). The head of the humerus articulates with the scapula at the shoulder joint. At the lower end of the shaft the trochlea articulates with the ulna and part of the radius. The radius also articulates with a rounded protuberance (the capitulum) close to the trochlea. Depressions (fossae) at the front and back of the humerus accommodate the ulna and radius, respectively, when the arm is flexed or straightened.
