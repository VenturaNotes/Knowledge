- Symbol $H$. A thermodynamic property of a system defined by $H=U+p V$, where $H$ is the enthalpy, $U$ is the internal energy of the system, $p$ its pressure, and $V$ its volume. In a chemical reaction carried out in the atmosphere the pressure remains constant and the enthalpy of reaction, $\Delta H$, is equal to $\Delta U+p \Delta V$. For an exothermic reaction $\Delta H$ is taken to be negative.
