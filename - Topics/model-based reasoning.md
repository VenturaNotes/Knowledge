- An approach in artificial intelligence that relies on the use of a model as the basis of its inferencing abilities rather than empirical information. A model is a principled representation of a problem domain that has predictive and explicative features. An example is seen in diagnosis applications where model-based reasoning offers an alternative to methods based on probabilistic reasoning.
