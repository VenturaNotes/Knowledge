- (1) An agreement by one party to make good the losses suffered by another, usually by payment of money, repair, replacement, or reinstatement. This is the function of indemnity insurance. 
- (2) An undertaking by a bank's client, who has lost a document (such as a share certificate or bill of lading), that the bank will be held harmless against any consequences of the document's absence if it proceeds to service the documents that have not been mislaid. The bank usually requires a letter of indemnity to make sure that it suffers no loss.
