- the anterior part of each cerebral hemisphere (see CEREBRUM), extending as far back as the deep central sulcus (cleft) of its upper and outer surface. Immediately anterior to the central sulcus lies the motor cortex, responsible for the control of voluntary movement; the area further forward $\textendash$ the prefrontal lobe $\textendash$ is concerned with behavior, learning, judgment, and personality.

- The anterior part of each cerebral hemisphere in the brain. It is associated with higher mental functions, such as planning and reasoning, and in humans, speech; it is the seat of an individual's personality. A strip of the posterior frontal lobe, where it meets the parietal lobe, is the primary motor cortex (see CEREBRUM). Neurons here control muscle contractions in specific parts of the body.

- $n$. The anterior lobe of each cerebral hemisphere, separated on its lateral or outer surface from the parietal lobe by the central sulcus and from the temporal lobe by the lateral sulcus, involved in attention, short-term memory, and activities requiring planning and organization. Lesions in this area are associated with frontal lobe syndrome.
