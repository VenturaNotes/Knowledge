- the anterior part of each cerebral hemisphere (see CEREBRUM), extending as far back as the deep central sulcus (cleft) of its upper and outer surface. Immediately anterior to the central sulcus lies the motor cortex, responsible for the control of voluntary movement; the area further forward $\textendash$ the prefrontal lobe $\textendash$ is concerned with behavior, learning, judgment, and personality.

- The anterior part of each cerebral hemisphere in the brain. It is associated with higher mental functions, such as planning and reasoning, and in humans, speech; it is the seat of an individual's personality. A strip of the posterior frontal lobe, where it meets the parietal lobe, is the primary motor cortex (see CEREBRUM). Neurons here control muscle contractions in specific parts of the body.
