- (out-toeing) a foot deformity in which the forefoot points outward, usually presenting in the first or second year of life. Most children are born with external rotation contractures of the hips and this resolves shortly after walking begins. In some children out-toeing is caused by outward twisting of the tibia or femur; this is more common in children with neuromuscular abnormalities.
