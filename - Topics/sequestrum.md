- $n$. (pl. sequestra) a portion of dead bone formed in an infected bone in chronic osteomyelitis. It is surrounded by an envelope (involucrum) of sclerotic bone and fibrous tissue and can be seen as a dense area within the bone on X-ray. It can cause irritation and the formation of pus, which may discharge through a sinus, and is usually surgically removed (sequestrectomy).
