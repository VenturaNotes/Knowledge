- Computer output to laserdisc (COLD) was a computer output device popular in the early 1990s. It allowed businesses to print out large volumes of data onto special discs that could be read back on a dedicated player. By printing out data onto a laserdisc, information could be kept safe from damage or loss. Additionally, the ability to read back the discs meant that users could access the information whenever needed. Today, COLD systems are largely obsolete, replaced by newer technologies such as solid-state drives (SSDs) and USB flash drives.
