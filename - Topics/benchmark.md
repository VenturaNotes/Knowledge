- (benchmark problem) A problem that has been designed to evaluate the performance of a system (hardware and software). In a benchmark test a system is subjected to a known workload and the performance of the system against this workload is measured. Typically the purpose is to compare the measured performance with that of other systems that have been subject to the same benchmark test; the performance is then said to be benchmarked.
- Examples of benchmark programs include the Ackermann benchmark, debit/credit benchmark, pi benchmark, Ramp-C benchmark, and whetstone benchmark.
