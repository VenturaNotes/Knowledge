- Quantities that express the amount of variation in a random variable (compare MEASURES OF LOCATION). Variation is sometimes described as [[spread]] or dispersion to distinguish it from systematic trends or differences. Measures of variation are either properties of a probability distribution or sample estimates of them.
- The range of a sample is the difference between the largest and smallest value. The interquartile range is potentially more useful. If the sample is ranked in ascending order of magnitude two values of $x$ may be found, the first of which is exceeded by $75 \%$ of the sample, the second by $25 \%$; their difference is the interquartile range. An analogous definition applies to a probability distribution.
- The [[variance]] is the expectation (or mean) of the square of the difference between a random variable and its mean; it is of fundamental importance in statistical analysis. The variance of a continuous distribution with mean $\mu$ is$$\int(x-\mu)^{2} f(x) \mathrm{d} x$$and is denoted by $\sigma^{2}$. The variance of a discrete distribution is$$\sum(x-\mu)^{2} p(x)$$and is also denoted by $\sigma^{2}$. The sample variance of a sample of $n$ observations with mean $\bar{x}$ is$$\sum\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)^{2} /(n-1)$$and is denoted by $s^{2}$. The value $(n-1)$ corrects for bias.
- The [[standard deviation]] is the square root of the variance, denoted by $\sigma$ (for a distribution) or $s$ (for a sample). The standard deviation has the same units of measurement as the mean, and for a normal distribution about 5\% of the distribution lies beyond about two standard deviations each side of the mean. The standard deviation of the distribution of an estimated quantity is termed the [[standard error]].
- The mean deviation is the mean of the absolute deviations of the random variable from the mean.
