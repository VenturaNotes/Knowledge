- A state-owned organization set up either to provide a national service (such as the British Broadcasting Corporation) or to run a nationalized industry. The chairman and members of the board of a public corporation are usually appointed by the appropriate government minister. The public corporation attempts to reconcile public accountability for the use of public finance, freedom of commercial operation on a day-to-day basis, and maximum benefits for the community.

- The UK form of organization for nationalized industries. Public corporations were supposed to operate in the public interest, using capital provided by the government, but with managerial autonomy in day-to-day business. In fact there was considerable government intervention in their management, particularly in relation to investment spending and pricing policy.
