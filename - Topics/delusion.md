- $n$. a belief that is held with unshakable conviction, cannot be altered by rational argument, and is outside the person's normal cultural or subcultural belief system. The belief is usually wrong, but can occasionally be true: the abnormal pathology lies in the irrational way in which the person comes to the belief. In mental illness it may be a false belief that the individual is persecuted by others (paranoid delusion; see PARANOIA), is very powerful (grandiose delusion), is guilty of something they have not actually done, is poor, or is a victim of physical disease. Delusions may be a symptom of schizophrenia, acute intoxication, mania, delirium, or an organic psychosis. The intensity of the delusional belief may vary over time.
