- The characteristic pattern of weather elements in an area over a period. The weather elements include temperature, rainfall, humidity, solar insolation, wind, etc. The climate of a large area is determined by several climatic controls: (1) the latitude of the area, which accounts for the amount of solar radiation it receives; (2) the distribution of land and sea masses; (3) the altitude and topography of the area; and (4) the location of the area in relation to the ocean currents. Weather elements are important abiotic factors.
