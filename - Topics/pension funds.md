- State and private pension contributions invested to give as high a return as possible to provide the funds from which pensions are paid. In the UK, pension funds managed by individual organizations work closely with insurance companies and investment trusts, being together the institutional investors that have a dominant influence on many securities traded on the London Stock Exchange. An enormous amount of money is accumulated by these pension funds, which grows by weekly and monthly contributions; real estate and works of art are often purchased for investment by pension funds in addition to stock-exchange securities.
