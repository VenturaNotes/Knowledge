- An optical recording technology where the process of writing changes the area of the medium that is to represent a 1 bit from one physical state to another, e.g. from crystalline to amorphous, rather than producing a change in its external configuration or state of magnetization. This technology can be used either reversibly or nonreversibly, in some cases in the same medium by adjustment of the power of the laser beam. See CDRW.
