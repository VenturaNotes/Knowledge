- The five characteristics that have been identified by job characteristics theory as inducing the critical psychological states required for motivation at work:
	- skill variety-the degree to which the job includes different activities drawing on several skills and abilities;
	- task identity-the extent to which a person is able to complete a task from start to finish;
	- task significance - the degree to which a person carrying out a task perceives it to be important to the organization and its clients;
	- autonomy-the degree to which a person has discretion as to how and when the task will be done;
	- feedback-the extent to which the person receives feedback on the quality of performance from the task itself.
- These core job characteristics are important to the psychological well-being of the individual. If they are lacking, then job satisfaction (and hence motivation) may well suffer unless a programme of job enlargement or job enrichment is instituted.
