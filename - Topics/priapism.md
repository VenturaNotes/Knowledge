- $n$. a prolonged (greater than four hours) and usually painful erection of the penis. Ischaemic priapism is associated with blood disorders (such as sickle-cell disease or leukaemia) or haemodialysis or it can result from administration of drugs used to treat erectile dysfunction, such as papaverine or intracorporeal alprostadil. It requires urgent decompression by draining the blood from the corpora cavernosa of the penis with a 19 SWG butterfly needle and instilling a vasoconstrictor (e.g. phenylephrine). If aspiration fails surgical shunts may be necessary. An unrelieved ischaemic priapism results in eventual complete fibrosis of the spongy tissue of the corpora and no further erections are possible. A penile prosthesis may be appropriate in this situation. Nonischaemic priapism is usually caused by perineal trauma resulting in an arteriovenous fistula. This does not result in tissue damage. Embolization of the site of vascular injury is usually necessary.

- $n$. A condition resulting from a disorder within the penis or the central nervous system, characterized by prolonged erection of the penis, seldom accompanied by sexual arousal, but usually causing pain. \[From Greek priapizein to be lewd, from Priapos Priapus, the ancient deity personifying male fertility and generative power]
