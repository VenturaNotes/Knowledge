## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A part of a plant, such as a bud, leaf, or a portion of a root or shoot, that, when detached from the plant and inserted in soil, can take root and give rise to a new daughter plant. It depends on the formation of undifferentiated callus at the detachment site, which can produce adventitious roots under the appropriate culture conditions. Taking or striking cuttings is a horticultural method for propagating plants. See also VEGETATIVE PROPAGATION.
