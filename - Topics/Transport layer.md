## Synthesis
- The application layer relies on the transport layer (such as [[TCP]] or [[UDP]]) to ensure reliable communication.
- Ensures reliable data delivery (e.g., TCP/UDP)
- Ensures reliable delivery for application-layer protocols
- TCP and UDP are protocols within the transport layer
- Ensures correct delivery of data between devices, regardless of applications
	- #question how?
## Source[^1]
- The transport layer links the network between the [[support layer]] and [[user support layer]]
- The transport layer links the network, support layer, and user support layer
