## Source [^1]
- adj. Self-knowing, used in relation to consciousness of something personally experienced. In an article in the journal Canadian Psychologist in 1985, the Estonian-born Canadian psychologist Endel Tulving (born 1927) first put forward the idea that consciousness is not always autonoetic, because a person can know what happened, and when and where it happened, without conscious episodic memory of the event. For example, most people know when and where they were born without autonoetic conscious recollection of the birth. Autonoetic consciousness is the subjective re-experiencing of a past event. See also mental time travel. autonoesis $n$. \[From Greek autos self + noetikos of or relating to the rational mind, from noesis thought, from noein to think + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
