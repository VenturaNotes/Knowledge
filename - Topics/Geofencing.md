- Geofencing is a location-based service that uses a global positioning system (GPS), Wi-Fi, cellular data, or radio frequency identification (RFID) to establish a virtual boundary around a real-life geographic location. When a user ªs mobile device or RFID tag enters the boundaries of a geofence, a marketing action such as a text, social media advertisement, or app notification is sent to their device. Businesses use geofencing to keep track of company equipment, monitor the location of field employees, and present customers with targeted advertisements.
