- A class of crustaceans found chiefly in freshwater ponds, lakes, and brackish waters. It includes fairy shrimps (order Anostraca), tadpole shrimps (order Notostraca), water fleas (order Cladocera; see DAPHNIA), and clam shrimps (order Conchostraca). Branchiopods are small (typically $0.25-100 \mathrm{~mm}$ long) with fused thorax and abdomen and leaflike appendages used variously for swimming, feeding, or respiration. All except the anostracans have a platelike carapace enclosing some or all of the body.
