- The number of elements in a set. If two sets can be put in one-to-one correspondence with one another they have the same cardinal number or cardinality. For finite sets the cardinal numbers are $0,1,2,3, \ldots$, but infinite sets require new symbols to describe their cardinality. The cardinal number of the natural numbers, integers, and rational numbers is aleph-null. The cardinal number of the real numbers is denoted c (for continuum).
