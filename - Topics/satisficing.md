- A decision-making strategy that aims at reaching an adequate outcome rather than an optimal outcome. Examples of satisficing are charging a fixed mark-up over costs, and purchasing the same bundle of commodities each week. Satisficing is often justified on the grounds that optimizing involves costly information collection and processing. As an economic theory it fails to explain why optimization is not undertaken incorporating these additional costs.
