- Those activities of a bank that do not involve taking deposits from or providing financial services to the general public or SMEs; typically these include arranging finance for large corporations and public bodies, assisting in mergers and acquisitions, trading on financial markets, and managing assets on behalf of investors through e.g. unit trusts or hedge funds. When these activities are short-term and high-risk in character they are often referred to disparagingly as casino banking.
