- a test to determine whether excess bilirubin in the blood is conjugated or unconjugated, and therefore whether jaundice in a patient is due to haemolysis or to disease of the liver or bile duct. A sample of serum is mixed with sulphanilic acid, hydrochloric acid, and sodium nitrite. The immediate appearance of a violet colour is called a direct reaction and indicates that the jaundice is due to liver damage or obstruction of the bile duct. If the colour appears only when alcohol is added, this is an indirect reaction and points to haemolytic jaundice or a congenital unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia (see Gilbert's SYndROME). \[A. A. H. van den Bergh (1869-1943), Dutch physician]
