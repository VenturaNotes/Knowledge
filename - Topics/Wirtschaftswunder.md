- Literally translated from German: economic miracle. A term referring to the remarkable recovery of the West German economy after the Second World War. In 1945 West Germany was devastated by the war, and had to absorb millions of refugees from the East. By the 1960s West Germany had some of the world's most prosperous and productive industries, and a remarkably strong currency.
