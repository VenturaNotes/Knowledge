- a disorder of the oesophagus (gullet) characterized by uncoordinated or absent contraction of oesophageal smooth muscle and incomplete relaxation of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS), leading to disturbances of swallowing (see DYSPHAGIA). It may occur at any age and affects both sexes equally: symptoms include progressive difficulty in swallowing liquids and solids, food regurgitation, and chest pain precipitated by oesophageal spasm. Diagnosis is by barium swallow X-ray examination, endoscopy, and oesophageal manometry. Treatment is by endoscopic balloon dilatation of the LOS, surgical division of the muscle fibres of the LOS (Heller's cardiomyopathy), or by injection of botulinum toxin into the LOS.
