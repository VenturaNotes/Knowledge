- (of an array) 
- (1) The array of lower dimension that is obtained by fixing one or more of the indexes of the original array. For example, if $A$ is a $3 \times 4$ two-dimensional array then the slice $A[2,]$ denotes the one-dimensional row vector comprising the second row of $A$ while $A[, 3]$ denotes the column vector comprising the third column. 
- (2) (trim) The array that is obtained from a larger array of dimension $n$ by restricting the range of an index. For example, if $A$ is a $3 \times 4$ two-dimensional array then the $2 \times 4$ two-dimensional array comprising the first two rows only of $A$ is a slice of $A$.
