- (LTR) A length of double-stranded DNA, typically 250-600 bp, that is repeated at each end of integrated retroviral DNA and certain retrotransposons. One LTR directs the host cell to initiate transcription of the retroviral DNA, while the other directs cellular enzymes to trim the primary RNA transcript.
