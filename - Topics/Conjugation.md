- Conjugation refers to the inflection of verbs
- Whenever we change a verb from the present tense to the past tense, we are using conjugation
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the union of two microorganisms in which genetic material (DNA) passes from one organism to the other. In bacteria minute projections on the donor 'male' cell (pili) form a bridge with the recipient 'female' cell; the exact function of the pili is not known, but they are believed to have an important role in conjugation.

- (1) The fusion of two reproductive cells, particularly when these are both the same size (see ISOGAMY). 
- (2) A form of sexual reproduction seen in some algae (e.g. Spirogyra), some bacteria (e.g. Escherichia coli), and ciliate protozoans. Two individuals are united by a tube formed by outgrowths from one or both of the cells. Genetic material from one cell (designated the male) then passes through the tube to unite with that in the other (female) cell. In bacteria conjugation is initiated and directed by sex factors.
