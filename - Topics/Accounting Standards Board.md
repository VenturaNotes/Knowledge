- (ASB) Formerly, the recognized body for setting accounting standards in the UK. It was established in 1990 to replace the Accounting Standards Committee (ASC). As well as issuing Financial Reporting Standards (FRS), the ASB issued reports known as Abstracts through its offshoot, the Urgent Issues Task Force. In 2012 the ASB was abolished and responsibility for setting standards was transferred to its parent body, the Financial Reporting Council. The ASB's other functions were taken over by a new body, the Accounting Council
