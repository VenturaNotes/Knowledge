## Synthesis

- The movement of chloride ions $\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$into red blood cells. Carbon dioxide reacts with water to form carbonic acid in the red blood cells (see CARBONIC ANHYDRASE). The carbonic acid then dissociates into hydrogencarbonate ions $\left(\mathrm{HCO}_{3}^{-}\right)$and hydrogen ions $\left(\mathrm{H}^{+}\right)$. The plasma membrane is relatively permeable to negative ions. Therefore the hydrogencarbonate ions diffuse out of the cell into the plasma, leaving the hydrogen ions, which create a net positive charge; this is neutralized by the diffusion of chloride ions from the plasma into the cell.
