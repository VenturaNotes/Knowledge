- $n$. a substance formed when the iron atoms of the blood pigment haemoglobin have been oxidized from the ferrous to the ferric form (compare OXYHAEMOGLOBIN). The methaemoglobin cannot bind molecular oxygen and therefore it cannot transport oxygen round the body. The presence of methaemoglobin in the blood (methaemoglobinaemia) may result from the ingestion of oxidizing drugs or from an inherited abnormality of the haemoglobin molecule. Symptoms include fatigue, headache, dizziness, and cyanosis.
