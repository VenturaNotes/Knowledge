- A situation in which levels of inflation are so high that money becomes virtually worthless and monetary exchange breaks down, to be replaced by a system of barter. The appropriate accounting treatment is set out in Section 31 of the Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. UK listed companies must apply International Accounting Standard 29.

- Very rapid inflation; it is sometimes reckoned to set in when price increases exceed 50 per cent per month. Such rapid inflation not merely makes money useless as a store of value, but seriously affects its use as a medium of exchange, and greatly disrupts productive economic activity.
