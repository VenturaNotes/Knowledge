- A reform of the health care industry in the United States, officially named the 'Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act' but also known as the 'Affordable Care Act'. The act was signed into law in 2010 by President Barack Obama. The reform aimed at improving access to affordable private and public health insurance by setting up a competitive insurance marketplace and by introducing a set of benefits, rights, and protections for consumers. Republicans fiercely opposed it, and Donald Trump, when campaigning for President, pledged to abolish Obamacare. However, the proposed legislation to do this had to be withdrawn in March 2017 because it could not garner enough Republican support in the House of Representatives.
