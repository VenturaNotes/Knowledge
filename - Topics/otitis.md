- $n$. inflammation of the ear. Otitis externa is inflammation of the canal between the eardrum and the external opening of the ear (the external auditory meatus). Myringitis is inflammation of the eardrum, often due to viral infection. Acute otitis media is inflammation, usually due to viral or bacterial infection, of the middle ear (the chamber lying behind the eardrum and containing the three bony ossicles that conduct sound to the inner ear). Symptoms include pain and a high fever. Treatment is with antibiotics and sometimes also by surgical drainage (myringotomy). Secretory otitis media (or otitis media with effusion) is a chronic accumulation of fluid in the middle ear, causing hearing loss (see GLUE EAR). Chronic otitis media (COM) is chronic inflammation of the middle ear associated with perforations of the eardrum and in some instances with cholesteatoma. The treatment involves surgical repair of perforations (myringoplasty) or removal of the air cells in the mastoid bone (mastoidectomy). Chronic otitis media was previously known as chronic suppurative otitis media but the terminology was changed as the formation of pus is not an inevitable part of the condition. See also LABYRINTHITIS.
