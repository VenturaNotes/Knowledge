- An increase in the value of an asset. This is the difference between the present value and the price at which the asset was purchased. If the general price level is stable, real and nominal capital gains are equal. If there is general inflation of prices, capital assets show real gains only if their prices increase proportionally faster than the general price level, and assets with constant money values suffer real capital losses.
