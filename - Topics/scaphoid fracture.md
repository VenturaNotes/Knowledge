- a fracture of the scaphoid bone in the wrist, usually caused by a fall onto the outstretched hand. There is pain and swelling in the anatomical snuffbox and movements of the wrist and thumb are painful. If the fracture is suspected but not initially visible on X-ray, advanced imaging (a bone scan, CT scan, or MRI) is now increasingly used to confirm the diagnosis without delay. Treatment is with a cast for an undisplaced fracture and by internal fixation for a displaced fracture. Due to the anatomy of its blood supply, healing can take a long time, and a bone graft and internal fixation may be required for non-union.
