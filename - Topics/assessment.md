- The method by which a tax authority raises a bill for a particular tax and sends it to the taxpayer or his or her agent. The assessment may be based on figures already agreed between the authority and the taxpayer or it may be an estimate by the tax authorities. The taxpayer normally has a right of appeal against an assessment within a specified time limit. See also SELF-ASSESSMENT; DEFERRED ASSET.
