- $n$. doing good: one of the four principles of medical ethics. The obligation to act in patients' best interests at all times is recognized in ancient and modern codes of professional conduct, e.g. the Hippocratic oath. Benefits in health care, and therefore beneficence, must commonly be balanced against risks or harms (i.e. nonmaleficence). The courts have been clear that beneficence extends beyond medical interests. Respect for autonomy requires that professionals determine what the patient considers to be doing good in any given situation.
