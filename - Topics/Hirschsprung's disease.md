- a congenital condition in which the rectum and sometimes part of the lower colon have failed to develop a normal nerve network. The affected portion does not expand or conduct the contents of the bowel, which accumulate in and distend the colon. Symptoms, which are usually apparent in the first weeks of life, are vomiting, constipation, abdominal distension, and intestinal obstruction. Diagnosis is by rectal biopsy (to confirm the absence of nerve cells), anorectal manometry, and imaging. Treatment involves surgical removal of the affected segment and anastomosis of the remaining healthy bowel to the anus. See also MEGACOLON. \[H. Hirschsprung (1830-1916), Danish physician]
