## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The phenomenon occurring when a population is founded by a small sample of the entire species, perhaps just a handful of individuals. Chance dictates that these founder members will be genetically unrepresentative of the species as a whole, and that the genetic make-up of the new population will differ markedly from the main species population. The founder effect thus increases the likelihood of evolutionary divergence from the main species, and eventually the formation of a new species. See PERIPATRIC SPECIATION.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. The tendency for an isolated offshoot of a population to develop genetic differences from the parent population owing to the distribution of alleles in its founder members not being perfectly representative of the distribution in the parent population. Compare GENETIC DRIFT.
