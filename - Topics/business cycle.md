- The fluctuation of economic activity around the long-term growth path. A cycle involves a period of above-trend growth of output (recovery and prosperity), and a period of below-trend stagnation or decline (contraction or recession). Cycles of various lengths have been identified. The shortest cycle is the Kitchin inventory cycle (3-5 years). Next follows the Juglar fixed investment cycle ( $7-11$ years)-this is the standard economic cycle. The Kuznets infrastructural investment cycle is even longer (15-25 years). The longest cycle usually identified is the Kondratieff wave (45-60 years). See also ENDOGENOUS BUSINESS CYCLE; POLITICAL BUSINESS CYCLE; REAL BUSINESS CYCLE.

- (trade cycle) The process by which investment, output, and employment in an economy tend to move through a recurrent cycle of upturn, prosperity, downturn, and recession. The cycle does not describe a regular pattern in either length or amplitude. Cycles in the immediate postwar period were of historically low amplitude, while those of the late 1970s and 1980s had greater amplitude and involved much deeper recessions. The reasons for the business cycle remain little understood. See also Kondratieff cycle.
