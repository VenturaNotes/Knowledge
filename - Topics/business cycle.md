- The fluctuation of economic activity around the long-term growth path. A cycle involves a period of above-trend growth of output (recovery and prosperity), and a period of below-trend stagnation or decline (contraction or recession). Cycles of various lengths have been identified. The shortest cycle is the Kitchin inventory cycle (3-5 years). Next follows the Juglar fixed investment cycle ( $7-11$ years)-this is the standard economic cycle. The Kuznets infrastructural investment cycle is even longer (15-25 years). The longest cycle usually identified is the Kondratieff wave (45-60 years). See also ENDOGENOUS BUSINESS CYCLE; POLITICAL BUSINESS CYCLE; REAL BUSINESS CYCLE.
