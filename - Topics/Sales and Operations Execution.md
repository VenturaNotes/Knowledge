- Sales and operations execution (S&OE) is a process for managing the interactions between sales and operations ensuring both functions work toward the same goals. It is also used for supply-chain planning. S&OE uses analytics, metrics, and data to help businesses identify issues from the sales or operation processes, and they can then eliminate these problems before they become significant.
