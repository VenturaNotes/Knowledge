- A transition metal complex in which there is more than one transition metal atom. The magnetic properties of such complexes are more complicated than for complexes with one transition metal atom, as it is necessary to take account of the magnetic interactions between transition metal atoms. However, it is possible to understand the properties of polynuclear transition metal complexes using molecular-orbital theory. The metal atoms can be linked either by metal-metal bonds or by bridging ligands.
