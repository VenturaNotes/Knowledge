- A device commonly found in X25 networks and which is placed between a DTE and a DCE. It is used when a DTE that does not implement (fully) the X25 protocol wants to communicate with an X25 network; it performs packet assembly (data coming from the DTE are assembled into packets and forwarded to the DCE) as well as packet disassembly (packets coming from the DCE are disassembled before the data are sent to the DTE).
