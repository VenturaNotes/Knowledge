- (pl. kinocilia) The single cilium of a hair cell that protrudes much further than the other, relatively short, stereocilia. In cross-section, its shaft has the $9+2$ array of microtubules characteristic of motile cilia (see flagellum sense 2). Kinocilia are absent from some hair cells in the mammalian ear; they do not seem to be essential for the cell's sensory function.
