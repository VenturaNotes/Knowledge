- (pl. kinocilia) The single cilium of a hair cell that protrudes much further than the other, relatively short, stereocilia. In cross-section, its shaft has the $9+2$ array of microtubules characteristic of motile cilia (see flagellum sense 2). Kinocilia are absent from some hair cells in the mammalian ear; they do not seem to be essential for the cell's sensory function.

- $n$. A long hair with a bulbous tip that projects from every hair cell. In the vestibular system, in the macula within the saccule in the membranous labyrinth of the inner ear, it is embedded in a gelatinous matrix containing crystals of calcium carbonate that exert gravitation drag on it and on the shorter stereocilia. kinocilia pl. \[From Greek kineein to move + Latin cilium an eyelash]
