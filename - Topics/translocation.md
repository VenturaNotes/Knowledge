## Source[^2]
- (1) (in botany) The movement of minerals and chemical compounds within a plant. There are two main processes. The first is the uptake of soluble minerals from the soil and their passage upwards from the roots to various organs by means of the water-conducting vessels (xylem). The second is the transfer of organic compounds, synthesized by the leaves, both upwards and downwards to various organs, particularly the growing points. This movement occurs within the phloem tubes. See also mass flow. 
- (2) (in genetics) A type of chromosome mutation in which a section of one chromosome is broken off and becomes attached to another chromosome, resulting in a loss of genetic information from the first chromosome.
