- $n$. A unit for comparing the intensity of any two power levels, given by the logarithm to the base 10 of the ratio of the two levels. Hence a ratio of $10: 1$ corresponds to 1 bel and a ratio of $100: 1$ to 2 bels. For sound measurements, the more common unit is the decibel, which is equal to one-tenth of a bel. \[Named after the Scottish-born US scientist Alexander Graham Bell (1847-1922), inventor of the telephone]
