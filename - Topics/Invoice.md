- An invoice is a business document that lists the products or services provided by a seller to a buyer. Typically, an invoice includes an invoice number, the name and address of both the buyer and seller, a description of the items and/or services purchased, any related fees, payment terms, the quantity and price per item or service, and the final monetary total owed.
- Businesses use invoices to accurately track their revenue and expenses. Invoices also help businesses decrease the risk of miscommunication with their customers and business partners regarding financial transactions.
