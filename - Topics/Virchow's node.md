- an enlarged lymph node that may be palpated above the left clavicle (the left supraclavicular fossa). It is strongly associated with abdominal malignancy, particularly cancer of the stomach, since the lymphatic drainage from the abdomen is channelled via the thoracic duct to the left side of the neck before it enters the left subclavian vein. Enlargement of the right supraclavicular lymph node is associated with lung and oesophageal cancer.
