- $n$. an alkaloid that is derived from the leaves of the coca plant (Erythroxylon coca) or prepared synthetically and was formerly used as a local anaesthetic in ear, nose, and throat surgery. Since it causes feelings of exhilaration and may lead to psychological dependence, cocaine has been replaced by safer anaesthetics.
