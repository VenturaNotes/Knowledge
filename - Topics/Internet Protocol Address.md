- An IP address is a unique number that is assigned to every device that is connected to the internet by an Internet Service Provider (ISP). Example: 192.124.800.3. This number, however, is not permanent and changes each time a device connects to a new network. IP Addresses are generally not visible online, but if the IP address is uncovered, it can reveal the general location of the user.
