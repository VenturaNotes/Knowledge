- $n$. A sheet of glass or other transparent material that both reflects and transmits light. If the area on one side of the screen is brightly lit and the area on the other dimmed, then it is possible to see through the screen from the dimmed side but not from the bright side. This device is used for research in which it is useful to be able to observe people without being observed. If the screen is made of half-silvered glass, then it is often called a one-way mirror.
