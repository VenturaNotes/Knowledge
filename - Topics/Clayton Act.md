- A US act of 1914 extending federal antitrust law. It forbade price discrimination, tying arrangements and exclusive dealing, and the acquisition of another corporation's stock where this led to monopoly or decreased competition. The act allowed triple damages to those injured by breaches of antitrust law. Labour unions and agricultural associations were exempted from antitrust actions.
