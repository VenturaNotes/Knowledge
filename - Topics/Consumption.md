## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Consumption is using resources to satisfy current needs and wants, unlike investing

## Source[^2]
- In economics, the final use of goods and services by economic agents to satisfy their needs, as opposed to providing for future production. National income accounting distinguishes private consumption and consumption by government bodies. Private consumption is divided between spending on non-durables, which are goods and services for immediate enjoyment, and spending on durables, such as cars, which are expected to provide services over a number of years. See also AUTONOMOUS CONSUMPTION; CAPITAL CONSUMPTION; CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION.
## Source[^3]
- (1) The using up of consumer goods and services for the satisfaction of the present needs of individuals, organizations, and governments. 
- (2) The amount of money spent by the whole of an economy on consumer goods and services. Economists contrast this amount of money (sometimes called consumers' expenditure) with the amount spent on investment, which provides for future consumption. In most economies about $80 \%$ of national income is spent on consumption, the balance going to investment. However, the distinction between consumption and investment is not always clear as some goods, such as consumer durables, provide for both present and future consumption.
