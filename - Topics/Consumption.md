## Source[^2]
- In economics, the final use of goods and services by economic agents to satisfy their needs, as opposed to providing for future production. National income accounting distinguishes private consumption and consumption by government bodies. Private consumption is divided between spending on non-durables, which are goods and services for immediate enjoyment, and spending on durables, such as cars, which are expected to provide services over a number of years. See also AUTONOMOUS CONSUMPTION; CAPITAL CONSUMPTION; CONSPICUOUS CONSUMPTION.
