- (homotopic) A continuous transformation of one function $f: X \to Y$ between two topological spaces (or metric spaces) into another function $g: X \to Y$. Formally, a homotopy is a continuous function $H:X \times [0, 1] \to Y$ such that $H(x,0) = f(x)$ and $H(x,1) = g(x),$ and the functions $f,g$ are said to be homotopic, which is written $f \simeq g$
