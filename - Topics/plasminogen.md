- $n$. a substance normally present in the blood plasma that may be activated to form plasmin. See FIBRINOLYSIS; PLASMINOGEN ACTIVATORS.
## Source[^2]
- The inactive precursor of the enzyme plasmin.

TPA made with recombinant DNA technology is used to dissolve blood clots in patients suffering from cardiovascular disease or stroke.
