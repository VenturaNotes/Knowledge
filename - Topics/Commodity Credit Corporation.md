- A US federal agency set up in 1933 to provide price support for US farmers. Federal Treasury money is used to lend to farmers on the security of their crops; the loans and accumulated interest can be settled by delivery of the crops at support prices. The CCC sells the resulting stocks later if and when prices rise.
