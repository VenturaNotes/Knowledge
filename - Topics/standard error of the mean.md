- (SEM) the standard deviation within a sample of observations divided by the square root of the number of observations comprising that sample. The SEM measures the extent to which the means of several different samples taken repeatedly from the same population would vary. It is therefore an indication of the accuracy of the sample mean as an estimate of the mean of the population as a whole.
