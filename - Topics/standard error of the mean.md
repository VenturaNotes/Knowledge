- (SEM) the standard deviation within a sample of observations divided by the square root of the number of observations comprising that sample. The SEM measures the extent to which the means of several different samples taken repeatedly from the same population would vary. It is therefore an indication of the accuracy of the sample mean as an estimate of the mean of the population as a whole.

- (SEM) The standard deviation within a sample of observations (e.g. of plant sizes) divided by the square root of the number of observations comprising that sample. Whereas the standard deviation of a sample provides a measure of the scatter of the data, the SEM measures the extent to which the means of several different samples taken from the same population would vary. It is therefore an indication of the accuracy of the sample mean as an estimate of the mean of the population as a whole.
