- One of three main components of the attitudes a person (potential customer) can have regarding an object or phenomenon. The affective component is concerned with the customer's emotional reactions and involves such questions as: Is this brand good or bad? Is it desirable? Is it likeable? It also involves such judgments as: 'I love BMWs'; 'The Japanese are not competent to make luxury cars'. While the former emotional response may be based upon 10 years' experience of BMWs, the latter may be based upon little cognitive information. The affective component of an attitude need not be based on experience.
