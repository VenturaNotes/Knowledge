- $n$. A concept introduced into psychoanalysis by the British-based Austrian psychoanalyst Melanie Klein (1882-1960) to denote an infantile fantasy in which the parents are united in a permanent sexual act, the mother containing the father's penis or the whole father, or the father containing the mother's breast or the whole mother. Klein developed the concept fully in her book The Psycho-Analysis of Children (1932, at pp. 103-4). Also called a combined parent. See also phallic WOMAN.
