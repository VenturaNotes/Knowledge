## Source [^1]
- A piece of hardware, consisting of one or more special-purpose microprocessors, dedicated to performing the data transformations necessary to render complex graphics on a raster display. The additional speed gained from performing these operations by hardware, rather than by software using the computer's CPU, is essential for 3-D animations and other modern uses of computer graphics.
