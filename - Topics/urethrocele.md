- $n$. prolapse of the urethra into the vaginal wall, which may be small and does not cause any symptoms or may cause a bulbous swelling to appear in the vagina, particularly on straining. The condition is associated with previous childbirth. Treatment is not required for small urethroceles, otherwise surgical repair of the lax tissues gives better support to the urethra and the vaginal wall.
