- Generation scheduling is also known as power scheduling or load scheduling. Itâ€™s the process of maintaining a balance between supply and demand in a power system. Specialized tools analyze the network and then the general scheduling platform optimizes the energy flow. Flow from a power-generating company can depend on constraints (e.g., carbon emissions). Power system schedules run in many stages. They can occur hourly, daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.
