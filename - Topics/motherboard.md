- A printed circuit board into which other boards can be plugged. In microcomputer systems the motherboard carries all the major functional elements, e.g. the processor and some of the memory; the function can be enhanced by additional boards that perform specific activities such as memory extension or disk control and that communicate to the motherboard via sockets onto a standard bus.
