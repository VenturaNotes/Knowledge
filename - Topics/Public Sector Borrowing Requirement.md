- (PSBR) The amount the UK government had to borrow each year, when the government's expenditure exceeded its income, now known as the Public Sector Net Cash Requirement. The PSBR was regarded as an important indicator of the government's fiscal stance. It did not include the proceeds of selling off privatized industries, which were thus effectively treated as current government income.
