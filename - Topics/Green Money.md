- Green money is mostly used when discussing investments in environmental initiatives; it is not a literal form of currency. Green money can be money generated from the sale of environmental products, such as solar panels, electric vehicles, and carbon tax credits. The interest in green money has grown over the past few decades, as more people have become aware of existing environmental challenges and the benefits of converting to a greener economy.
