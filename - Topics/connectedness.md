- A measure of the extent to which a given graph is connected. An undirected graph is $k$-connected if for every pair of vertices $u$ and $v$ there are at least $k$ paths between $u$ and $v$ such that no vertex other than $u$ and $v$ themselves appear on more than one path. A connected graph is 1-connected, a biconnected graph is 2-connected.
