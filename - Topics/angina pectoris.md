- pain in the centre of the chest, which is induced by exercise and relieved by rest and may spread to the jaws and arms. Angina pectoris occurs when the demand for blood by the heart exceeds the supply of the coronary arteries and it usually results from coronary artery atheroma. It may be prevented or relieved by such drugs as glyceryl trinitrate and beta blockers. If drug treatment proves ineffective, coronary angioplasty or coronary artery bypass grafts may be required, the former being less invasive than the latter.
