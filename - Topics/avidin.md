- A glycoprotein component of egg white that binds strongly to the vitamin biotin. Proteins and nucleic acids can be linked to biotin (biotinylated), and the avidin-biotin reaction can then be used in a number of assay methods, such as antigen-antibody reactions or DNA hybridization. For example, enzymes conjugated with avidin can be used to bind to biotinylated antibodies.
