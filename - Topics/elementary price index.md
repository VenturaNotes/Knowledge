- An unweighted price index that does not take into account the relative importance of different goods in a consumer's basket of purchases. An elementary price index is formed without using quantity or expenditure weights. For example, the mean price at time $t$ divided by the mean price at time 0 is an elementary price index. See also BASE-WEIGHTED INDEX; CURRENT-WEIGHTED INDEX; FISHER'S IDEAL PRICE INDEX.
