- $n$. imaging of arteries (see ANGIOGRAPHY). The major roles of arteriography are to demonstrate the site and extent of atherosclerotic narrowing or occlusion, especially in the coronary arteries (see CORONARY ANGIOGRAPHY) and leg arteries (peripheral arteriography), and to demonstrate the anatomy of aneurysms within the skull (carotid and vertebral arteriography). This technique is also used to image a bleeding vessel prior to blocking it (see EMBOLIZATION).
