- adj. Of, relating to or consisting of a method of arranging a set of items in the manner of a dictionary, by ordering them first according to one attribute, then according to a second, and so on. Thus the words $c a b, d a b$, den, and fag are lexicographically ordered, and so are the vectors $(3,1,2),(4,1,2),(4,5,14)$, and $(6,1,7)$, and the relation between the two systems of ordering can be seen by setting $a=1, b=2, \ldots, z=26$. Also called lexical, though this is liable to cause confusion and is avoided in careful usage, because this adjective usually refers to lexemes or words. See also lexiCographic choice, lexicographic SEMIORder. \[From Greek lexikon a dictionary, from lexis a word, from legein to speak + graphein to write + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
