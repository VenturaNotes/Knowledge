- $n$. A curve traced out by a point moving in simple harmonic motion in two directions perpendicular to each other, the shape of the curve being determined by the relative frequencies and phases of the motion. If the motion is observed for some time on an oscilloscope screen, the direction of apparent rotation appears to reverse spontaneously. \[Named after the French physicist Jules Antoine Lissajous (1822-80) who first constructed it]
