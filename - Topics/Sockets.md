- A socket is an endpoint (software component) within a network communications flow. Sockets are typically used by software platforms that use the client-server model.
- In the client-server model, a network server creates a socket and assigns it a network port address (a number used to identify a connection endpoint). The client then creates their own socket and connects to the server socket to receive and send information.
- Software development companies often use sockets to give their software solutions the ability to maintain network connection in real time, which is crucial for web-based applications to function properly.
