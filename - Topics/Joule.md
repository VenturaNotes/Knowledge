- The SI unit of work, abbreviated to 'J'. One joule is the work done when the point of application of a force of 1 newton moves a distance of 1 meter in the direction of the force
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the SI unit of work or energy, equal to the work done when the point of application of a force of 1 newton is displaced through a distance of 1 metre in the direction of the force. In electrical terms the joule is the work done per second when a current of 1 ampere flows through a resistance of 1 ohm. Symbol: J. See also CALORIE.
