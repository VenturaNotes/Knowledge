- $n$. A rare condition, resulting from stroke, traumatic brain injury, or the aftereffects of brain surgery, in which a person beings to speak with an accent (1) that sounds foreign, sometimes resembling the accent associated with a specific foreign language, but is actually caused by disrupted articulation and prosody resulting from left hemisphere brain injury. The condition was first reported by the Czech neurologist Arnold Pick (1851-1924) in an article in the journal Zeitschrift f√ºr die gesamte Neurologie und Psychiatrie in 1919. Reports of foreign language syndrome, in which, following brain injury, people allegedly speak foreign languages that they have never previously spoken, are spurious, although there are cases of people reverting to languages that they used to speak earlier in life.
