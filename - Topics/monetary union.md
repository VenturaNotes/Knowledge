## Source[^2]
- Two or more countries with a single currency. Countries which formerly had independent monetary systems unite to adopt a single currency, or keep separate currencies but enter into a permanent and credible agreement to maintain a constant exchange rate between their currencies. A monetary union requires either a single central bank or the adoption of effective policy coordination between the central banks of the member countries; the Eurozone in fact has both.
