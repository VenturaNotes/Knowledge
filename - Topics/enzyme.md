## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A [[protein]] that speeds up chemical reactions in living things
- Enzymes are essential for digestion, blood clotting, and growth
## Source[^2]
- Enzymes are proteins that help speed up [[metabolism]], or the chemical reactions in our bodies
	- They build some substances and break others down
	- All living things have enzymes
	- Our bodies naturally produce enzymes
	- Enzymes are also in manufactured products and food
## Source[^3]
- $n$. a protein that, in small amounts, speeds up the rate of a biological reaction without itself being used up in the reaction (i.e. it acts as a catalyst). An enzyme acts by binding with the substance involved in the reaction (the substrate) and converting it into another substance (the product of the reaction). An enzyme is relatively specific in the type of reaction it catalyses; hence there are many different enzymes for the various biochemical reactions. Each enzyme requires certain conditions for optimum activity, particularly correct temperature and pH , the presence of coenzymes, and the absence of specific inhibitors. Enzymes are unstable and are easily inactivated by heat or certain chemicals. They are produced within living cells and may act either within the cell (as in cellular respiration) or outside it (as in digestion). The names of enzymes usually end in '-ase'; enzymes are named according to the substrate upon which they act (as in lactase), or the type of reaction they catalyse (as in hydrolase).
- Enzymes are essential for the normal functioning and development of the body. Failure in the production or activity of a single enzyme may result in metabolic disorders; such disorders are often inherited and some have serious effects. -enzymatic adj.
## Source[^4]
- A protein that acts as a catalyst in biochemical reactions. Each enzyme is specific to a particular reaction or group of similar reactions. Many require the association of certain nonprotein cofactors in order to function. The molecule undergoing reaction (the substrate) binds to a specific active site on the enzyme molecule to form a short-lived intermediate (see ENZYME-SUBSTRATE COMPLEX): this greatly increases (by a factor of up to $10^{20}$) the rate at which the reaction proceeds to form the product. Enzyme activity is influenced by substrate concentration and by temperature and pH , which must lie within a certain range. Other molecules may compete for the active site, causing inhibition of the enzyme or even irreversible destruction of its catalytic properties.
- Enzyme production is governed by expression of the particular gene encoding the enzyme. This expression is in turn regulated by mechanisms depending on a host of factors, such as stage of development of the organism, type of tissue, hormonal and nutritional status, nature of the environment, etc. Enzyme activity is further controlled by pH changes, alterations in the concentrations of essential cofactors, feedback inhibition by the products of the reaction, and activation by another enzyme, either from a less active form or an inactive precursor (zymogen). Such changes may themselves be under the control of hormones or the nervous system. See also ENZYME KINETICS.
- Enzymes are classified into six major groups, according to the type of reaction they catalyse: (1) oxidoreductases; (2) transferases; (3) hydrolases; (4) lyases; (5) isomerases; (6) ligases.
- The names of most individual enzymes also end in -ase, which is added to the names of the substrates on which they act. Thus lactase is the enzyme that acts to break down lactose; it is classified as a hydrolase.
## Source[^5]
- $n$. Any of a large group of protein substances that are produced in living cells and that function as catalysts in biochemical reactions. An enzyme usually has an affinity for a particular chemical structure (the substrate), and the enzyme-substrate complex proceeds through the chemical reaction faster than the substrate alone. Chemical names ending in -ase are generally enzymes. See acetyLCholinesterase, adenylate cyclase, ATPase, catechol-o-methyl-transferase, DNA ligase, DNA polymerase, esterase, luciferase, monoamine oxidase, pepsin, phosphodiesterase type5, polymerase Chain Reaction, RESTRICTION ENZYME, REVERSE TRANSCRIPTASE, RNA polymerase, tyrosine Hydroxylase, Tryptophan Hydroxylase. \[From Greek en in + zyme leaven]
