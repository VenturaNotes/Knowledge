## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A [[protein]] that speeds up chemical reactions in living things
- Enzymes are essential for digestion, blood clotting, and growth

## Source[^2]
- Enzymes are proteins that help speed up [[metabolism]], or the chemical reactions in our bodies
	- They build some substances and break others down
	- All living things have enzymes
	- Our bodies naturally produce enzymes
	- Enzymes are also in manufactured products and food
## Source[^3]
- $n$. a protein that, in small amounts, speeds up the rate of a biological reaction without itself being used up in the reaction (i.e. it acts as a catalyst). An enzyme acts by binding with the substance involved in the reaction (the substrate) and converting it into another substance (the product of the reaction). An enzyme is relatively specific in the type of reaction it catalyses; hence there are many different enzymes for the various biochemical reactions. Each enzyme requires certain conditions for optimum activity, particularly correct temperature and pH , the presence of coenzymes, and the absence of specific inhibitors. Enzymes are unstable and are easily inactivated by heat or certain chemicals. They are produced within living cells and may act either within the cell (as in cellular respiration) or outside it (as in digestion). The names of enzymes usually end in '-ase'; enzymes are named according to the substrate upon which they act (as in lactase), or the type of reaction they catalyse (as in hydrolase).
- Enzymes are essential for the normal functioning and development of the body. Failure in the production or activity of a single enzyme may result in metabolic disorders; such disorders are often inherited and some have serious effects. -enzymatic adj.
