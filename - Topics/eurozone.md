- The 19 member countries of the European Union that have adopted the euro as their currency, namely Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, The Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. Monetary policy in these countries is now the responsibility of the European Central Bank. In 2010 confidence in the eurozone was threatened by mounting sovereign debt in several member states, most notably Greece. European finance ministers responded by creating the European Financial Stability Facility (bail-out fund) to provide emergency assistance; this was replaced by the European Stability Mechanism in 2012. See European Economic and Monetary Union.
