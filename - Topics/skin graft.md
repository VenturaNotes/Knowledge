- a portion of healthy skin cut from one area of the body and used to cover a part that has lost its skin, usually as a result of injury, burns, or operation. A skin graft is normally taken from another part of the body of the same patient (an autograft), but occasionally skin may be grafted from one person to another as a temporary healing measure (an allograft). The full thickness of skin may be taken for a graft (see FLAP) or the surgeon may use three-quarters thickness, thin sheets of skin (see SPLIT-SKIN GRAFT), or a pinch skin graft. The type used depends on the condition and size of the damaged area. The skin graft may be free or attached by a pedicle.
