- A flaky test is a term used to describe a test typically conducted on a software solution that randomly results in both passes and failures, even when no changes are made to the code. In other words, the test is a software testing method that produces unreliable results. Flaky tests can be caused by erroneous code, an issue with the test itself, or an external factor that compromises the reliability of the software test results. The best approach to dealing with and resolving a flaky test is to investigate its root cause. If there is an issue with the code, then ignoring a flaky test will result in software bugs.
