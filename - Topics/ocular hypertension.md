- (OHT) a constantly raised intraocular pressure (greater than 21 mmHg by Goldmann applanation tonometry) registered on two or more occasions in one or both eyes with the absence of evidence of optic nerve damage or visual field defect. Intraocular pressure increases slowly with age and OHT can increase the risk of developing glaucoma. It is treated with eye drops and surgery if indicated.
