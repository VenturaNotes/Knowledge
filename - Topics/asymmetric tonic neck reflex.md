- a primitive reflex that is present from birth but should disappear by six months of age. If the infant is lying on its back and the head is turned to one side, the arm and leg on the side to which the head is turned should straighten, and the arm and leg on the opposite side should bend (the 'fencer' position). Persistence of the reflex beyond six months is suggestive of cerebral palsy.
