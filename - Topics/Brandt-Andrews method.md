- method a technique for expelling the placenta from the uterus. Upward pressure is applied to the uterus through the abdominal wall while holding the umbilical cord taut. When the uterus is elevated in this way, the placenta will be in the cervix or upper vagina and is then expelled by applying pressure below the base of the uterus. \[T. Brandt (1819-95), Swedish obstetrician; H. R. Andrews (1872-1942), British gynaecologist]
