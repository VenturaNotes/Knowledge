- (grid) The result of subdividing a region in time and/or space into smaller subregions. A rectangular region in the $x, y$-plane can thus be divided into smaller rectangles by lines parallel to the $x$ - and $y$-axes. The points of intersection of the lines are called the mesh (or grid) points. A discretization method replaces differential equations defined in a region by a finite set of equations, which define approximations to the exact solution at the mesh points. The finite-difference and finite-element methods are important methods of this general type. See also ADAPTIVE MESHING.
