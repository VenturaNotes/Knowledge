- A version of the generalized least squares estimator used when the covariance matrix of the random error is known to be diagonal. This estimator minimizes the sum of squares of residuals weighted by the inverse of the standard deviation for each observation. Thus, the more reliable observations (those with relatively lower variance) are weighted more heavily in estimation than the less reliable ones.
