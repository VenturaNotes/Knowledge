## Source[^2]
- $n$. The most common form of anomalous dichromacy in which the visual pigment that absorbs medium-wavelength (green) light is non-functional, resulting in poor hue discrimination in the red and green regions of the spectrum and a tendency to confuse reds with greens and greens with blues. Compare deuteranomaly, protanopia, tritanopia. \[From Greek deuteros second, alluding to the second of the three primary colors (1) red, green, and blue + anopia blindness, from an- without + ops an eye + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
