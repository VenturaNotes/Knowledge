- $n$. In psychophysics, the proposition that for any stimulus intensity $I$, the difference threshold $\Delta I$ is proportional to the square root of $I$, hence $\Delta I=k \bar{I}$, where $k$ is a constant, rather than being proportional to $I$ itself, as in Weber's law, which is both simpler and generally more accurate. \[Named after the US psychologists George Stuart Fullerton (1859-1925) and James McKeen Cattell (1860-1944) who formulated it in 1892]
