## Source [^1]
- A term used in the context of methods for ordinary and partial differential equations. A formula derived from a discretization is consistent if the order is at least one with respect to the stepsize, $h$. Consistency is a necessary condition for convergence of a discretization formula (see ERROR ANALYSIS).
