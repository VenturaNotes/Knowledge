- A method of quality control where a sample is taken from a batch and a decision whether to accept the batch is made on the basis of the quality of the sample. The most simple method is to have a straight accept/reject criterion, but a more sophisticated approach is to take another sample if the evidence from the existing sample, or a set of samples, is not clearly indicating whether the batch should be accepted or rejected. One of the main advantages of this approach is reducing the cost of taking samples to satisfy quality control criteria.

- (lot acceptance sampling) A statistical process-control technique that uses inspection of a sample from a batch to decide whether to accept or reject the whole batch. In deciding the level of sampling, a balance has to be struck between achieving the desired quality levels and the cost of undertaking the sampling.
