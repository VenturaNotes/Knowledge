- (echovirus) one of a group of RNA-containing viruses that are able to multiply in the gastrointestinal tract (see enterovirus). About 30 different types exist. Type A Coxsackie viruses generally cause less severe and less well-defined diseases, such as hand, foot, and mouth disease, although some cause meningitis and severe throat infections (see HERPANGINA). Type B Coxsackie viruses cause inflammation or degeneration of heart tissue, resulting in pericarditis or myocarditis, or brain tissue, producing meningitis or encephalitis. They can also attack the muscles of the chest wall, the bronchi, pancreas, thyroid, or conjunctiva and recent evidence suggests they may be implicated in diabetes in children and in motor neuron disease. See also BORNHOLM DISEASE.
