- $n$. a point at which two or more structures of the body cross to the opposite side. The term is used particularly for the point at which nerve fibres cross over in the central nervous system.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A chiasm, crossing over, or intersection in the form of the letter X , as in the nerve fibres in the optic chiasm or the pyramidal decussation, both of which are partly rather than fully decussated in the human brain. The partial decussation of the visual pathways was discovered in 1704 by the English mathematician and physicist Isaac Newton (1642-1727). In most fishes and birds the visual pathways are completely crossed, but as animals evolved with eyes more towards the front of the head than the side, the percentage of uncrossed fibres increased. In mammals, the percentage of uncrossed fibres is related to the amount of overlap between the visual fields of the two eyes, overlapping visual fields providing an accurate depth perception through stereopsis. In human beings there is almost complete overlap of visual fields and almost half the fibres are uncrossed. Most other sensory and motor information is fully crossed, except in the cerebellum. See also divided VISUAL FIELD, VENTROMEDIAL TRACT. decussate $v b$. \[From Latin decussis the numeral 10, written X, from decem assi a coin worth ten asses, from decem ten + as, assis a Roman copper coin + -ation indicating a process or condition]
