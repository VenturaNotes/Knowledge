- (glioblastoma multiforme) $n$. the most aggressive type of brain tumor derived from non-nervous (glial) tissue (see ASTROCYTOMA). Its rapid enlargement destroys normal brain cells, with a progressive loss of function, and raises intracranial pressure, causing headache, vomiting, and drowsiness. Treatment is never curative and the prognosis is poor.
