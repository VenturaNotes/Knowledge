## Source [^1]
- The release of oxygen from isolated illuminated chloroplasts when suitable electron acceptors (e.g. potassium ferricyanide) are added to the surrounding water. The reaction was discovered by Robert Hill (1899-1991) in 1939; the electron acceptors substitute for $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$, the natural acceptor for the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis.
