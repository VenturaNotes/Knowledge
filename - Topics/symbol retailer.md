- (voluntary retailer) A voluntary group of independent retailers formed to buy in large quantities from wholesalers at lower prices than they could achieve independently. Originally a defensive move by independents to counter the increasing dominance and expansion of the multiple stores, supermarkets, hypermarkets, etc., these groups can also provide each other with such services as promotional support and management advice. The members of a group often use a common name or symbol to identify themselves.
