- The recovery of a habituated response (see habituation) in an animal following the application of a different stimulus. For example, if the siphon of the sea slug Aplysia is repeatedly tapped, the reflex withdrawal of the siphon is gradually reduced. But if the animal's tail is then given a strong electric shock, further tapping of the siphon will cause a withdrawal response that is nearer normal. Compare SENSITIZATION (sense 3).
