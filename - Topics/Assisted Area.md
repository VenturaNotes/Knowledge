- A UK region made eligible for special government assistance, under the state aid rules of the European Commission, to encourage investment because of persistently above-average unemployment. Development Areas are eligible for more help than Intermediate Areas. Grants for these areas are also available from the European Union through the European Regional Development Fund. Although special help for Assisted Areas has been available under various schemes since the 1930s, regional differences in unemployment have been very persistent.
