- $n$. the process of making identical copies (clones) of genes, cells, or organisms. Therapeutic cloning, which is lawful if licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, produces human blastocysts to harvest their stem cells. In reproductive cloning, whole animals are produced: see CLONE (sense 2); reproductive cloning of humans is unlawful in the UK. The moral issues relative to therapeutic and reproductive cloning are hotly debated, although for many it is the purpose of cloning that determines its moral acceptability or otherwise.
