- Block error rate (BLER) is a measurement of quality control for audio data such as the data stored on CDs. BLER takes into account the number of blocks (or sets of audio data) with errors vs. the total number of blocks that exist.Â The formula of BLER is EB/TB, which is simply dividing the number of blocks with errors by the total number of blocks. BLER should be around 2% for best playback quality. If the ratio is higher, it indicates the audio is out of sync or poor quality.
