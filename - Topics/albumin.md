- One of a group of globular proteins that are soluble in water but form insoluble coagulates when heated. Albumins occur in egg white (the protein component of which is known as albumen), blood, milk, and plants. Serum albumins, which constitute about 55% of blood plasma protein, help regulate the osmotic pressure and hence plasma volume. They also bind and transport fatty acids. $\alpha$-Lactalbumin is one of the proteins in milk.
