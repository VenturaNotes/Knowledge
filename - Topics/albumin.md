## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- One of a group of globular proteins that are soluble in water but form insoluble coagulates when heated. Albumins occur in egg white (the protein component of which is known as albumen), blood, milk, and plants. Serum albumins, which constitute about 55% of blood plasma protein, help regulate the osmotic pressure and hence plasma volume. They also bind and transport fatty acids. $\alpha$-Lactalbumin is one of the proteins in milk.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a protein that is soluble in water and coagulated by heat. An example is serum albumin, which is found in blood plasma and is important for the maintenance of plasma volume. Albumin is synthesized in the liver; the inability to synthesize it is a prominent feature of chronic liver disease (cirrhosis).
