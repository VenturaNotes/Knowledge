- A strategy that aims to gain competitive advantage for a product or service across the whole of an industry by making it distinct from its competitors in terms of quality or brand image. The strategy was described by Michael Porter in 1980, who distinguished it from the low-cost strategy and the focus strategy. Such an approach is most likely to succeed where the market is not highly price-sensitive and there is scope for effective branding. See GENERIC STRATEGIES.
