## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Has Autonomous sourcing which finds data for you
- Has validation methods that ensure your research is reliable
- Has generative workflows that turn data into slide decks and infographics 
- Notebooks created should be topic specific. 
	- Should not have one that's "research" or "general notes"
	- This is because NotebookLM performs better when sources are related and focused on a single topic
- When uploading files to a Notebook, it supports PDFs, YouTube videos, websites, google docs, audio files, and plain text
	- Great to mix these formats to cover topics from multiple angles
	- NotebookLM can pull transcripts from a YouTube video
	- Multi-format approach great because different formats offer different value
		- Academic Paper: Rigor
		- Videos: Accessible explanations
		- Blog Post: Industry Context
		- Podcast: Conversational insights
- It has "Deep Research" or "Fast Research" for an in-depth report and new sources.
	- Will launch an agentic AI tool that autonomously researches your topic
		- Analyzes topic
		- Finds sources
		- Evaluates them
		- Adapts its search
		- Gives comprehensive report
	- "Deep research" will discover 50 sources related to your topic
		- Gives both curated research report and high-quality sources already loaded and ready to work with
	- There is a button to remove all failed resources.
	- NotebookLM good at reducing hallucinations (as it grounds everything in sources)
		- But NotebookLM can still give answers based on flawed information without distinguishing between them if sources are
			- Outdated
			- Biased
			- Mixed Content
				- #question Why would a source be bad if it's mixed content? Like if you're researching one thing but contains information that's not relevant to your topic?
	- Validation Framework to fix this:
		- (1) Ask it to create a table showing each source with its publication date, author credentials, and whether its primary source, secondary analysis, or opinion piece
			- #comment Although you probably could just specify types of sources you want before deep research is even done.
		- Good sources are from
			- Academic papers
			- Industry reports
			- Technical documentation
		- (2) Then ask which sources are most frequently cited or referenced by other sources in this notebook
			- Helps find sources foundational to topic vs which ones are peripheral
		- (3) Then ask to summarize perspective or bias of the top five most substantial sources
			- Will help to see if you're looking at the topic from multiple angles or if all the sources are sharing the same viewpoint
			- Controversial or evolving topics
				- Diverse perspectives needed
			-  Technical documentation
				- Perspective matters less
- Setting Configuration
	- Default (general research)
	- Learning Guide (educational content)
	- Custom (Specific use-cases)
		- If about AI could prompt: Research analyst focused on AI safety and alignment debates.
	- Response length is either default, longer or shorter
		- "Longer" preferred for more detailed analysis
- NotebookLM only synthesizes documents that are check marked in the sidebar
- Studio Panel Options
	- #comment Note that generation of the content below can take some time and might not be good first time around.
	- #question What is the limit of these features for the free version in NotebookLM?
	- Audio Overview
		- Address what to focus on, what tone to use, and length of overview
		- Can ask for length within prompt to be under 15 minutes for example
		- Good idea to modify and regenerate several times to get the info you need
	- Infographic (powered by Nano Banana Pro which is Google's image generation model)
		- "Standard" is best for level of detail.
			- "Detailed" can introduce minor text errors with complex topics
			- "Concise" sometimes oversimplifies
		- Types of designs
			- Talking Charts
			- Diagrams
			- Text Hierarchies
			- Visual Layouts
		- Quality of infographic
			- Publication-ready quality
			- Minor spelling errors in detailed mode
			- Consistent accuracy in standard mode
		- Example produced:
			- ![[Screenshot 2026-01-29 at 9.43.32 AM.png|400]]
	- Slide Deck (Creating a presentation deck)
		- Presenter slides better since it's more visual and text minimal
	- Video Overview
		- Narrated explainer video with AI-generated visuals based on your sources
			- Explainer option connects content within sources
			- Brief option gives core idea from sources
		- Custom Style Example
			- Clean, modern design with blue and white color scheme. Minimalist graphics and professional typography
		- Great for
			- Educational Content
			- Presentation Materials
			- Shareable Research Explanations
	- Reports
		- Options include 
			- Create your own
				- Follows your specific structure such as comparisons and methodology
			- Briefing doc
				- Creates a clean professionally structured document summarizing key findings from all sources
				- Could use as foundation for reports or presentations
			- Study Guide
			- Blog Post
	- Flashcards
		- Generates quick Q&A pairs for memorization
	- Quiz
		- Full interactive test (based on specific data uploaded)
	- Mind Map
		- Interactive diagram showing how the key concepts actually connect to your sources
			- Can click on one to generate a detailed chat response about specific idea
			- Great for visual learners as it helps you spot connections between files that you would miss by reading linearly
- NotebookLM great because it can do the below all for you
	- Read through sources
	- Extract key points
	- Design slides
	- Find/Create visuals
	- Structure the narrative
- When asking about sources
	- Citations are listed which highlights the exact passage in the original document letting you verify the accuracy of the text instantly
- Summary
	- Deep Research
	- Source Validation
	- Notebook Setup
	- Source Filtering
	- AI Outputs
	- Mind Maps
	- Living System
- Complete workflow from source discover though
	- Validation
	- Configuration
	- Content Generation
	- Organization
## Source[^2]
- In Studio column, you have "Quiz" option
	- Options
		- Number of questions
		- Level of difficulty
		- Custom prompt for what topic should be
			- And as with all the artifacts you can create in the studio, you can actually input your own suggestions for what you want to focus on
	- Can take a few minutes to generate the quiz
		- When done, (for default modes with custom prompt), it creates 9 multiple-choice questions
			- Includes hint and then explanation after choosing an answer
