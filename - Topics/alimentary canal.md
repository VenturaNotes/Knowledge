- $n$. The tubular passage from the mouth to the anus through which food passes and within which digestion takes place, comprising the pharynx, oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine. Also called the digestive tract or gastrointestinal tract.
## Source[^2]
- the long passage through which food passes to be digested and absorbed (see illustration). It extends from the mouth to the anus and each region is specialized for a different stage in the processing of food, from mechanical breakdown in the mouth to chemical digestion and absorption in the stomach and small intestine and finally to faeces formation and water absorption in the colon and rectum.

## Source[^3]
- (digestive tract; gut) A tubular organ in animals that is divided into a series of zones specialized for the ingestion, digestion, and absorption of food and for the elimination of indigestible material (see illustration). In most animals the canal has two openings, the mouth (for the intake of food) and the anus (for the elimination of waste). Simple animals, such as cnidarians (e.g. Hydra and jellyfish) and flatworms, have only one opening to their alimentary canal, which must serve both functions.
