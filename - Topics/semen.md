- (seminal fluid) $n$. the fluid ejaculated from the penis at sexual climax. Each ejaculate may contain 300-500 million spermatozoa suspended in a fluid secreted by the prostate gland and seminal vesicles with a small contribution from Cowper's glands. It contains fructose, which provides the spermatozoa with energy, and prostaglandins, which affect the muscles of the uterus and may therefore assist transport of the spermatozoa. $\textemdash$seminal adj.
## Source[^2]
- A slightly alkaline fluid ($\mathrm{pH} ~7.2-7.6$ ) containing sperm and various secretions that is produced by a male mammal during copulation and is introduced into the body of the female by ejaculation. Spermatozoa are produced by the testes and the secretions by the prostate gland, seminal vesicles, and Cowper's glands. Semen also contains enzymes that activate the sperm after ejaculation.
