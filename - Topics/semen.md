- (seminal fluid) $n$. the fluid ejaculated from the penis at sexual climax. Each ejaculate may contain 300-500 million spermatozoa suspended in a fluid secreted by the prostate gland and seminal vesicles with a small contribution from Cowper's glands. It contains fructose, which provides the spermatozoa with energy, and prostaglandins, which affect the muscles of the uterus and may therefore assist transport of the spermatozoa. $\textemdash$seminal adj.
