- A plasmid found in the cytoplasm of certain bacteria that is responsible for initiating conjugation and gene transfer. The sex factor in Escherichia coli is known as the $\mathbf{F}$ factor; it can be transferred from a donor cell $\left(\mathrm{F}^{+}\right)$to a recipient $\left(\mathrm{F}^{-}\right)$by conjugation, enabled via formation of a sex pilus. Occasionally the F factor may become integrated with the chromosome of an $\mathrm{F}^{+}$bacterium to form a high-frequency recombinant (Hfr) cell. This enables the part of the host chromosome nearest to the F factor to be transferred to the recipient by conjugation.
