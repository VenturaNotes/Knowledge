## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. According to a distinction introduced by the US philosopher Ned J(oel) Block (born 1942) in a co-edited book entitled The Nature of Consciousness (1997), aspects of consciousness that are phenomenal in the sense of being directly experienced, often (but perhaps not always) accompanied by access consciousness. An example of phenomenal consciousness initially without access consciousness arises when a person involved in a conversation suddenly notices that the sound of a ticking clock has been clearly audible throughout the conversation. Up to that moment, the person was phenomenal-conscious of the sound but not access-conscious of it, because the sound was available to conscious perception but was not poised for control of action until it was noticed. Also called $P$ consciousness. phenomenal-conscious or P-conscious adj.
