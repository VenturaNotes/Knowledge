- Any of the antigens that are present on the outer surface of red blood cells (erythrocytes). There are more than 100 different agglutinogens and they form the basis for identifying the different blood groups. Antibodies in the plasma, known as agglutinins, react with the agglutinogens in blood of an incompatible blood group (see AGGLUTINATION).
## Source[^2]
