- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a term suggested by the French novelist, dramatist, and essayist Romain Rolland (1866-1944) to Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), who discussed it as a basis of religion in his book Civilization and its Discontents (1930, Standard Edition, XXI, pp. 64-145 at pp. 64-5, 72). It is a transcendental sense of a limitless and indissoluble bond between oneself and the external world that Freud believed to underlie religious sentiments (which he could not discover in himself). See also PEAK EXPERIENCE.
