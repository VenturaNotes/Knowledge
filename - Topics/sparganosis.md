- $n$. a disease caused by the migration of certain tapeworm larvae (see SPARGANUM) in the tissues beneath the skin, between the muscles, and occasionally in the viscera and brain. The larvae, which normally develop in frogs and reptiles, are transferred to humans who eat the uncooked flesh of these animals or drink water contaminated with minute crustaceans infected with the tapeworm larvae. The larvae cause inflammation, swelling, and fibrosis of the tissues. Treatment of the condition, common in the Far East, involves surgical removal of the larvae.
