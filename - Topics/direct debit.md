- A form of standing order given to a bank by an account holder to pay regular amounts from his cheque account to a third party. Unlike a normal standing order, however, the amount to be paid is not specified; the account holder trusts the third party to claim from his bank an appropriate sum. In the USA this system is known as reverse wire transfer.
