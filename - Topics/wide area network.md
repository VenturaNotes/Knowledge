- An example of a WAN is the [[World Wide Web]]

## Source[^2]
- A network with communications often over large distances and, like a local area network (LAN), generally operated by a single organization. In the case of a WAN, however, this organization may be active in commerce or industry and have plant or offices at a number of widely dispersed sites. Alternatively the principal activity of the organization may be the operation of the WAN, as with a public network operator. In both cases the WAN will interconnect the LANs at the dispersed sites. See also METROPOLITAN AREA NETWORK.
