- a receptor on synapses that binds the neurotransmitter glutamate and also binds its agonist NMDA ($N$-methyl-D-aspartate). This receptor is involved in learning, memory, mood, and cognition; its overactivity is associated with chronic pain. NMDA-receptor antibodies are associated with an encephalitis preceded by psychiatric symptoms, often in patients with ovarian malignancy (teratoma). NMDA-receptor antagonists (e.g. amantadine, memantine hydrochloride, riluzole) are used in the treatment of (among other conditions) epilepsy, Alzheimer's disease, and chronic pain syndromes.
