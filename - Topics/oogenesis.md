- $n$. the process by which mature ova (egg cells) are produced in the ovary (see illustration). Primordial germ cells multiply to form oogonia, which start their first meiotic division to become oocytes in the fetus. This division is not completed until each oocyte is ovulated. The second division is only completed on fertilization. Each meiotic division is unequal, so that one large ovum is produced with a much smaller polar body.

## Source[^2]
- The production and growth of the ova (egg cells) in the animal ovary. Special cells (oogonia) within the ovary divide repeatedly by mitosis to produce large numbers of prospective egg cells (primary oocytes). When mature, these undergo meiosis, which halves the number of chromosomes. During the first meiotic division a polar body and a secondary oocyte are produced. At the second meiotic division the secondary oocyte produces a large haploid ootid, which matures into the ovum, and a second polar body. Oocytes may be present in the ovaries at birth and may represent the total number of eggs to be produced.
