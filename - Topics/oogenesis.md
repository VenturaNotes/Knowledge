- $n$. the process by which mature ova (egg cells) are produced in the ovary (see illustration). Primordial germ cells multiply to form oogonia, which start their first meiotic division to become oocytes in the fetus. This division is not completed until each oocyte is ovulated. The second division is only completed on fertilization. Each meiotic division is unequal, so that one large ovum is produced with a much smaller polar body.
