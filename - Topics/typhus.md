- (spotted fever) $n$. any one of a group of infections caused by rickettsiae and characterized by severe headache, a widespread rash, prolonged high fever, and delirium. They all respond to treatment with chloramphenicol or tetracyclines. Epidemic typhus (also known as classical or louse-borne typhus) is caused by infection with Rickettsia prowazekii transmitted by lice. It was formerly very prevalent in overcrowded insanitary conditions (as during wars and famines), with a mortality rate approaching 100%. Endemic typhus (murine or flea-borne typhus) is a disease of rats due to Rickettsia mooseri; it can be transmitted to humans by rat fleas, causing a mild typhus fever. There are in addition several kinds of tick typhus (in which the rickettsiae are transmitted by ticks), including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, and typhus transmitted by mites (see RICKETTSIAL POX; SCRUB TYPHUS).
