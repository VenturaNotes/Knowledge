- A contract between the owner of a specific asset, the lessor, and another party, the lessee, allowing the latter to hire the asset. The lessor retains the right of ownership but the lessee acquires the right to use the asset for a specific period of time in return for the payment of specific rentals or payments. The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland classifies leases into operating leases and finance leases with differing accounting treatments (Section 20). The relevant International Accounting Standard is IAS 17, Leases.
