- $n$. (pl. fungi) a simple organism (formerly regarded as a plant) that lacks the green pigment chlorophyll. Fungi include the yeasts, rusts, moulds, and mushrooms. They live either as saprophytes or as parasites of plants and animals; some species infect and cause disease in humans. Some yeasts are a good source of vitamin B and many antibiotics are obtained from the moulds (see PENICILLIN). â€”fungal adj.
