- The part of the eye that connects the choroid with the iris. It consists of three zones: the ciliary ring, which adjoins the choroid; the ciliary processes, a series of about 70 radial ridges behind the iris to which the suspensory ligament of the lens is attached; and the ciliary muscle, contraction of which alters the curvature of the lens (see ACCOMMODATION).
## Source[^2]
- The circular band of tissue surrounding and supporting the lens of the vertebrate eye. It contains the ciliary muscles, which bring about changes in the shape of the lens (see also ACCOMMODATION). The ciliary body produces the aqueous humour.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The thickened vascular tunic of the eye between the choroid and the iris, including the ciliary muscle. \[From Latin cilium an eyelash]
