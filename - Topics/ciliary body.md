- the part of the eye that connects the choroid with the iris. It consists of three zones: the ciliary ring, which adjoins the choroid; the ciliary processes, a series of about 70 radial ridges behind the iris to which the suspensory ligament of the lens is attached; and the ciliary muscle, contraction of which alters the curvature of the lens (see ACCOMMODATION).
