- (LCF) A continuous survey of household expenditures and the cost of living that reflects household budgets across the UK. The primary uses of the survey are to provide information about spending patterns for the consumer price index, and about food consumption and nutrition. Other uses of the LCF include the estimation of consumers' expenditure for the national income accounts, and as an input into tax-benefit modelling. It is the most significant consumer survey undertaken in the UK and an important source of economic and social data for government and research agencies.
