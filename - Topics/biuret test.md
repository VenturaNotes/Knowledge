- A biochemical test to detect proteins in solution, named after the substance biuret $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{NCONHCONH}_{2}\right)$, which is formed when urea is heated. Sodium hydroxide is mixed with the test solution and drops of $1 \%$ copper(II) sulphate solution are then added slowly. A positive result is indicated by a violet ring, caused by the reaction of peptide bonds in the proteins or peptides. Such a result will not occur in the presence of free amino acids.
