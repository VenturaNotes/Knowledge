- an imaging system that allows a PET scan (see POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY) and a CT scan (see COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY) to be performed very close together, with minimal movement of the patient between scans. This means that the images produced can be co-registered (see CO-REGISTRATION), giving very accurate anatomical localization (from the CT scan) of areas of increased activity (identified on the PET scan). This is very important for determining the site of disease in order to plan treatment.
