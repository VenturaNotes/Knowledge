## Synthesis
- Division resulting in a float
- A feature introduced in Python 3.0 to replace the old division operator which had different behavior depending on whether the operands were integers or floats
## Source [^1]
- Using the `/` symbol will always return a float regardless of whether the [[operand|operands]] are integers or floats

### Examples
```python
# Operands are integers
print(5 / 2) #Output: 2.5 (float)

#Operands are floats
print(5.0 / 2) #Output: 2.5 (float)
```

## Source[^2]
- Also known as "normal" division or "floating-point" division
