## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. any of several techniques for separating the components of a mixture by selective absorption. Two such techniques are quite widely used in medicine, for example to separate mixtures of amino acids. In one of these, paper chromatography, a sample of the mixture is placed at the edge of a sheet of filter paper. As the solvent soaks along the paper, the components are absorbed to different extents and thus move along the paper at different rates. In column chromatography the components separate out along a column of a powdered absorbent, such as silica or aluminium oxide.
