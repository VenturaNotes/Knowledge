- A former commodity and freight-chartering exchange in the City of London. It took its name from the trade in grain with Baltic ports, which was the mainstay of the business in the 18th century. Its activities, including the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange (BIFFEX), are now undertaken by a department of the LIFFE, which is itself now part of ICE Futures Europe.
