## Source[^2]
- $n$. a disorder in which the body becomes hypersensitive to particular antigens (called allergens), which provoke characteristic symptoms whenever they are subsequently inhaled, ingested, injected, or otherwise contacted. Normally antibodies in the bloodstream and tissues react with and destroy specific antigens without further trouble. In an allergic person, however, the allergens provoke the release of a class of antibodies (IgE) that become bound to mast cells in the body's tissues. The subsequent reaction of allergen with tissue-bound antibody (see REAGIN) also leads, as a sideeffect, to cell damage, release of histamine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), inflammation, and all the symptoms of the particular allergy. Different allergies afflict different tissues and may have either local or general effects, varying from asthma and hay fever to severe dermatitis or gastroenteritis or extremely serious shock (see ANAPHYLAXIS).  $\textemdash$ allergic adj.
