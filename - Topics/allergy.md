## Source[^2]
- $n$. a disorder in which the body becomes hypersensitive to particular antigens (called allergens), which provoke characteristic symptoms whenever they are subsequently inhaled, ingested, injected, or otherwise contacted. Normally antibodies in the bloodstream and tissues react with and destroy specific antigens without further trouble. In an allergic person, however, the allergens provoke the release of a class of antibodies (IgE) that become bound to mast cells in the body's tissues. The subsequent reaction of allergen with tissue-bound antibody (see REAGIN) also leads, as a sideeffect, to cell damage, release of histamine and serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine), inflammation, and all the symptoms of the particular allergy. Different allergies afflict different tissues and may have either local or general effects, varying from asthma and hay fever to severe dermatitis or gastroenteritis or extremely serious shock (see ANAPHYLAXIS).  $\textemdash$ allergic adj.

## Source[^3]
- A condition in which the body produces an abnormal immune response to certain antigens (called allergens), which include dust, pollen, certain foods and drugs, or fur. In allergic individuals these substances, which in a normal person would be destroyed by antibodies, react with pre-existing antibodies or trigger responses in primed T cells. A common mechanism is binding of allergen to IgE on mast cells. This causes the latter to secrete histamine and other vasoactive agents, leading to inflammation and other characteristic symptoms of the allergy (e.g. asthma or hay fever). This response is a type of hypersensitivity. See also ANAPHYLAXIS.
