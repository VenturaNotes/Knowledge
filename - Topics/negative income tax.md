- (NIT) A means of targeting social security benefits to those most in need using the income-tax system. After submitting an income-tax return showing an income level below a set minimum, an individual would receive a direct subsidy from the tax authorities bringing income up to that level.
## Source[^2]
- A proposal to combine income tax payments and social security benefits in a single system. Under this system, all citizens would report their pre-tax incomes; they would then pay tax if their income after deducting any allowances to which they were entitled came above some cut-off level, and would receive payments if their income was below the cut-off. The advantage of such a system is that it integrates the tax and welfare systems.
