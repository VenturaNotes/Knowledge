	- This classification determines whether an employee is entitled to overtime pay and other labor standards protections like minimum wage
		- #question Is FLSA just a US thing?
		- #question Isn't it required for all jobs to pay at least minimum wage?
- Exempt Employees
	- Not covered: by the FLSA overtime provisions
		- #question What are these provisions?
	- Not entitled: to overtime pay
	- Typically: hold positions like executive, administrative, or professional roles
		- #question What kind of specific roles would this be? 
	- Generally: paid a salary
- Non-Exempt Employees
	- Covered: by the FLSA overtime provisions
	- Entitled: to overtime pay (time and one-half their regular rate) for hours worked over 40 in a workweek
	- Often: paid hourly
	- Must be paid: at least the federal minimum wage
		- #question What is the current federal minimum wage in the US?
- In summary: FLSA status dictates whether an employee is eligible for overtime pay, and the classification is based on factors like job duties and salary, according to the [[Department of Labor]]
