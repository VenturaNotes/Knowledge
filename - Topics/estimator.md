- A rule for using observed sample data to calculate the unobserved value of a population parameter. For example, a sample average of a variable is an estimator of the population mean of this variable. Statistical properties of an estimator, such as bias, consistency, and accuracy in a small sample, can be used to choose among various estimators typically available for the same parameter. See also ESTIMATE.
