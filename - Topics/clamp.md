## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (1) An electronic circuit that is designed to limit the excursion of the signal voltage to the desired level, e.g. to limit the reverse voltage produced when the current in a conductor is abruptly changed. 
- (2) An electronic circuit that is designed to return the d.c. voltage level at a given point in the circuit to a fixed reference value at fixed points in time, often in response to an externally generated clamp pulse.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a surgical instrument designed to compress a structure, such as a blood vessel or the intestine (see illustration). A variety of clamps have been designed for specific surgical procedures. Blood-vessel (atraumatic) clamps are used to stop bleeding from the cut vessels and are designed not to damage the arterial wall. Intestinal clamps prevent the intestinal contents from leaking into the abdominal cavity during operations on the intestines and are designed either not to damage the intestinal wall (noncrushing clamps) or to close the open end (crushing clamps) prior to excising and suturing the intestine to create an anastomosis.
