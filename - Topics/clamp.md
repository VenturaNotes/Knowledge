- (1) An electronic circuit that is designed to limit the excursion of the signal voltage to the desired level, e.g. to limit the reverse voltage produced when the current in a conductor is abruptly changed. 
- (2) An electronic circuit that is designed to return the d.c. voltage level at a given point in the circuit to a fixed reference value at fixed points in time, often in response to an externally generated clamp pulse.
