- In business terms, triage is defined as a system used to assign priority levels to tasks or customers and determine the most optimal order in which to deal with task assignments. This practice is typically used by software developers and engineers when the number of defects needing to be resolved in a sprint exceeds the number of resources available to mitigate them. Therefore, the highest priority tasks get addressed first, and lower level priorities are addressed later.
