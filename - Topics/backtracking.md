## Source [^1]
- A technique for solving problems recursively.

## Source[^2]
- A property of an algorithm that implies some kind of tentative search for a goal, and the possibility that any search path may turn out to be a dead end; the algorithm then retreats back down the search path to try another path. The technique is generally suitable for solving problems where a potentially large but finite number of solutions have to be inspected. It amounts to a systematic tree search, bottom-up.
