- (spiral organ) the sense organ of the cochlea of the inner ear, which converts sound signals into nerve impulses that are transmitted to the brain via the cochlear nerve. \[A. Corti (1822-88), Italian anatomist]
## Source[^2]
- The sensory part of the cochlea in the inner ear, which responds to sound. This organ, named after Italian anatomist A. G. G. Corti (1822-88), projects into the cochlear duct and consists of two membranes that run parallel to each other: sensory hair cells, rooted in the basilar membrane, are in contact with the overlying tectorial membrane (see illustration). During the transmission of sound waves the basilar membrane vibrates, causing the sensory hairs to flex against the tectorial membrane; this results in the production of impulses, which are transmitted to the brain via the auditory nerve.

## Source[^3]
- $n$. A spiral structure within the cochlea of the inner ear, containing the basilar membrane in which are situated hair cells that convert sound waves into nerve impulses. Also called Corti's organ. \[Named after the Italian anatomist Alfonso Corti (1822-76) who was the first to describe the structure of the inner ear in detail in 1851]
