- $n$. a disease of mammals and birds caused by the protozoan Toxoplasma gondii, which is usually transmitted to humans through ingesting undercooked meat or food or drink contaminated with the faeces of infected cats. Generally symptoms are mild (swollen lymph nodes and an influenza-like illness), but the disease can be serious in immunocompromised patients and requires treatment with a combination of pyrimethamine and sulfadiazine. Infection usually confers lifelong immunity. If acquired during pregnancy it can cause congenital toxoplasmosis in the unborn baby. Although most babies are unaffected or have very mild disease, some can have severe malformations of the skull and eyes or active infection in the liver. It can also cause stillbirth. Infection can be detected by blood tests in the mother; if the diagnosis is confirmed, the mother can be treated with spiramycin.
