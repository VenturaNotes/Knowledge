- (colonography) $n$. imaging of the colon. CT colography uses computerized tomography to obtain multiple axial thin-slice images (usually less than 3 mm thick), which can be electronically reformatted in two or three dimensions (see MULTIPLANAR RECONSTRUCTION). It has the added advantage of visualizing all the other abdominal organs. Although less invasive than colonoscopy, it cannot be used for biopsies or therapeutic procedures. MR colography, using magnetic resonance imaging, is becoming more commonplace; its advantage over CT colography is that the patient is not exposed to irradiation.
