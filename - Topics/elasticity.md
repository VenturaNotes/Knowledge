- A measure of how responsive one economic variable is to changes in another. 
	- For example, [[price elasticity]] measures how demand changes in response to price changes.
### Examples of Economic Variables[^2]
- Microeconomic variables
	- [[Price]] - The amount of money required to purchase a good or service
	- [[Quantity Demanded]] - The number of units of a good or service that consumers are willing and able to buy
	- [[Quantity Supplied]] - The number of units of a good or service that produces are willing and able to sell
	- [[Income]] - The earnings of consumers, which affect their [[purchasing power]]
	- [[Consumer Spending]] - The total money spent by households on goods and services
	- [[Production costs|production cost]] - The total expenses incurred in manufacturing goods or providing services
	- [[wage|wages]] - The compensation paid to labor for work performed
	- [[Interest Rate]] - The cost of borrowing money or the return on savings and investments
- Macroeconomic Variables
	- [[Gross Domestic Product]] (GDP) - The total value of all goods and services produced in an economy
	- [[Inflation Rate]] - The percentage increase in the general price level over time
	- [[Unemployment Rate]] - The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed and actively seeking work
	- [[Exchange Rate]] - The value of one currency in terms of another currency
	- [[Money Supply]] - The total amount of money available in an economy
	- [[Government Spending]] - The total expenditures by the government on goods and services
	- Budget Deficit / Surplus - The difference between government revenues and expenditures
	- Trade Balance - The difference between a country's exports and imports
- Example
	- Wage elasticity of labor supply 
		- Measures how the quantity of labor supplied responds to changes in wages
## Source[^3]
- The ratio between the proportional change in one variable and the proportional change in another. The elasticity of variable $y$ with respect to $x$ is $\varepsilon=(d y / y) /(d x / x)$. The concept is useful because comparisons of proportional changes are independent of the units in which the variables, such as price or quantity, are measured. As $(d y / y) /(d x / x)=d(\log y) / d(\log x)$, elasticity equals the ratio of changes in the logarithms of the two variables. See also ARC ELASTICITY; POINT ELASTICITY.
