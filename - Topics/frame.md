## Source [^1]
- A "frame" refers to a unit of data transmission at the [[data link layer]] (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
- Essentially a container that encapsulates packets from the Network Layer, adding control information like headers and trailers to ensure reliable data transmission over the physical network medium
	- #question what are trailers in this context?
- Frames are the final layer of encapsulation before data is sent over the physical layer itself

- (3) A single message or packet on a data link using a data link control protocol such as HDLC, ADCCP, etc. The frame is the unit of error detection, retransmission, etc. A special pattern of bits$\textemdash$a flag$\textemdash$marks the beginning and ending of the frame. In the HDLC protocol, a flag is the 8 -bit sequence$$01111110$$that when followed by any sequence of bits other than another flag denotes the beginning of a frame of data; the flag is maintained as a unique synchronizing sequence of bits since the rules of the protocol require that a 0 is automatically inserted by the sending equipment whenever it detects the presence of five 1 s in the input data stream.
