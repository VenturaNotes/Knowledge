## Source [^1]
- A "frame" refers to a unit of data transmission at the [[data link layer]] (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
- Essentially a container that encapsulates packets from the Network Layer, adding control information like headers and trailers to ensure reliable data transmission over the physical network medium
- Frames are the final layer of encapsulation before data is sent over the physical layer itself
