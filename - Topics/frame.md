### Description
- A "frame" refers to a unit of data transmission at the [[data link layer]] (Layer 2) of the OSI model.
- Essentially a container that encapsulates packets from the Network Layer, adding control information like headers and trailers to ensure reliable data transmission over the physical network medium
	- #question what are trailers in this context?
- Frames are the final layer of encapsulation before data is sent over the physical layer itself

- (3) A single message or packet on a data link using a data link control protocol such as HDLC, ADCCP, etc. The frame is the unit of error detection, retransmission, etc. A special pattern of bits$\textemdash$a flag$\textemdash$marks the beginning and ending of the frame. In the HDLC protocol, a flag is the 8 -bit sequence$$01111110$$that when followed by any sequence of bits other than another flag denotes the beginning of a frame of data; the flag is maintained as a unique synchronizing sequence of bits since the rules of the protocol require that a 0 is automatically inserted by the sending equipment whenever it detects the presence of five 1 s in the input data stream.

- (1) A rigid structure surrounding or enclosing an object such as a picture or a window. 
- (2) An underlying assumption or set of assumptions that supports an interpretation or a concept and that functions as an interpretive frame of reference for thinking about the concept. In the branch of artificial intelligence devoted to knowledge representation, a frame is a knowledge structure of an everyday aspect of the world such as a house, containing fixed structural information (all houses are assumed to have walls, a roof, and various other fixed attributes) and slots capable of accepting one of two or more values representing variable information (a house may be built from brick, concrete, or wood, and it may or may not have a garden, a garage, a swimming pool, and so on). This sense, close to the concept of a schema, was formulated in 1975 by the US cognitive scientist Marvin (Lee) Minsky (born 1927). See frame problem, framing EFFECT. 
- (3) A single image in a sequence forming a cinema, television, or video film; hence, figuratively, a part of a script (3) representing a single event, action, or scene. See also sCHEMA.
