- International Normalized Ratio: the ratio of a patient's prothrombin time (PT; i.e. the time taken for the patient's blood to clot) to a standardized 'normal' PT. It is used to monitor anticoagulant (usually warfarin) dosage. A normal INR is up to 1.2. Treatment usually aims to keep the ratio 2.0-3.0.
