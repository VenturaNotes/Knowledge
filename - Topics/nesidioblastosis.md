- $n$. a rare condition of childhood in which abnormal cells in the pancreas fail to mature properly and secrete a selection of hormones (including insulin) in an uncontrolled manner. This causes a variety of problems, including recurrent hypoglycaemia. It can sometimes be treated with medication; if this fails, surgical removal of a portion of the pancreas may be necessary.
