- $n$. A function that predicts the perceived brightness of light as a weighted combination of its component wavelengths, the weights or luminosity coefficients being derived from averaged luminosity curves of representative viewers. A photopic luminous efficiency function is required for cone-mediated vision in bright light and a scotopic luminous efficiency function for rod-mediated vision in dim light.
