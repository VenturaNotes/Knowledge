- (1) The purchase from an investor of a unit-trust holding by the trust managers. 
- (2) (repurchase agreement; repo) An agreement (in full a sale and repurchase agreement) in which one party sells a financial asset to another on terms that provide for the seller to buy it back later at an agreed price. The seller is paid in full and makes the agreement to raise ready money without losing the holding. The buyer negotiates a suitable repurchase price to enable a profit to be earned equivalent to interest on the money involved. Repurchase agreements originated in arrangements between the US Federal Reserve Bank and the money market, but are now widely used by large companies in the USA and also in Europe. Repos may have a term of only a few days$\textemdash$or even overnight. See also RETAIL REPO.
