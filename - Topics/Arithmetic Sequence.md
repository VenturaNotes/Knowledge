- A finite or infinite sequence of terms $a_{1}, a_{2}, a_{3}, \ldots$ with a common difference $d$, so that $a_{2}-a_{1}=d, a_{3}-a_{2}=d$, and so on. The first term is usually denoted by $a$. For example, $2,5,8,11, \ldots$ is the arithmetic sequence with $a=2, d=3$. In such an arithmetic sequence, the $n$-th term $a_{n}$ is given by $a_{n}=a+(n-1) d$.
