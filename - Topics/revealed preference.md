- Information about preferences revealed by economic choices. As prices and income change a consumer will make different choices. The observed choices can be used to construct a preference order for the consumer. Consider three bundles of goods, $A, B$, and $C$. An individual, who could have afforded something preferred to $B$ (for example, an alternative with more of all goods), chooses $A: A$ is thus strictly preferred to $B$. If the consumer chooses $A$ but could not afford $C$, it can in some cases still be shown that $A$ is preferred to $C$. This occurs if $B$ is chosen when something preferred to $C$ could have been afforded: $B$ is thus preferred to $C$. With transitive preferences, if $A$ is preferred to $B$ and $B$ is preferred to $C$, then $A$ is established to be revealed preferred to $C$, even though the consumer has not been observed making a direct comparison between $A$ and $C$.
