- $n$. A pattern of involuntary behavior occurring when a person is close to drowning, in the final minute before sinking underwater. It is very different from what most people expect and from the way drowning is depicted in fictional film and television enactments, especially inasmuch as drowning people cannot shout for help, because oxygen is instinctively reserved for breathing, or wave their arms above the water line, because the arms are instinctively splayed out to maximize buoyancy. The response was first identified by the US psychologist and lifeguard Francesco A. Pia (born 1943), on the basis of video footage of many actual and near-drownings, and published in a training film entitled On Drowning in 1970 and an article in the Journal of Physical Education in 1974. IDR abbrev.
