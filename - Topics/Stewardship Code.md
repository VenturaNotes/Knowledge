- A code of best practice for institutional investors, such as pension funds, insurance companies, and investment trusts, first issued in 2010. It provides guidelines on how such vehicles should engage with their investee companies, notably in the exercise of voting rights. The Code operates on the same 'comply or explain' basis as the UK Corporate Governance Code.
