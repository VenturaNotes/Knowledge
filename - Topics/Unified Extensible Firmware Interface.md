- Unified extensible firmware interface (UEFI) is a computer software specification that defines the interface that connects firmware to a computerâ€™s operating system. UEFI is the successor to the basic input/output system (BIOS), featuring more enhanced booting, programming, and security controls. Most modern desktop computers and laptops on the market today come with UEFI firmware installed on their motherboard, as UEFI provides better support for more complex, modern operating systems than its predecessor.
