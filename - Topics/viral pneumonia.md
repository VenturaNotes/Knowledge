- an acute infection of the lung caused by any one of a number of viruses, such as respiratory syncytial virus, adenovirus, influenza and parainfluenza viruses, and enteroviruses. It is characterized by headache, fever, muscle pain, and a cough that produces a thick sputum. The pneumonia can often occur with or subsequent to a systemic viral infection. Treatment is by supportive care, but antibiotics are administered if a bacterial infection is superimposed.
