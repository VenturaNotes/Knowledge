- The ability to perform certain tasks satisfactorily. Skills may involve physical dexterity, mental ability, or both. They can be learned either through formal instruction or through the apprenticeship system, working under the supervision of somebody who already has them. Individuals appear to differ in their ability to acquire skills. Workers with desirable scarce skills can generally obtain better paid and more secure jobs than those without them.
