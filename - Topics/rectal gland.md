- A gland found near the rectum of elasmobranch fishes that removes excess sodium chloride $(\mathrm{NaCl})$ from the blood. It consists of numerous blind-ending tubules surrounded by blood capillaries; the tubules drain into a duct that opens into the intestine. Sodium-potassium pumps in the cells lining the tubules create a concentration gradient of $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions across the serosal (blood) surface of the tubules, which in turn drives a cotransport system that moves chloride ions $\left(\mathrm{Cl}^{-}\right)$from the blood into the tubule cells. The resulting raised intracellular concentration of $\mathrm{Cl}^{-}$ions causes them to diffuse from the tubule cells into the duct lumen, and the consequent electrochemical gradient causes $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions to follow between the cells. Water also diffuses passively into the lumen, creating a solution that has the same osmolarity as the blood but containing a much higher concentration of NaCl . See also SALT GLAND.
