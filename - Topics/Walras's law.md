- The law states that the value of excess demand is zero. The excess demand, $z_{i}$, for good $i$ is the difference between demand, $x_{i}$, and the sum of supply from firms, $y_{i}$, and the initial endowment, $\omega_{i}$; hence $z_{i}=x_{i}-$ $y_{i}-\omega_{i}$. Noting that demand and supply are both functions of prices, Walras's law states that for an economy with $n$ goods$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i} z_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i}\left(x_{i}-y_{i}-\omega_{i}\right)=0$$for any prices $p_{i}, i=1, \ldots, n$. The law implies that in an economy with $n$ markets there are only $n-1$ independent demand-supply equations. Hence, when the general equilibrium for an economy with $n$ goods is studied only $n-1$ markets need to be analyzed. If a set of prices can be found that place these $n-1$ markets in equilibrium then the prices also ensure the $n$th market is in equilibrium.
