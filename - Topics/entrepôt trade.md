- Trade that passes through a port, district, airport, etc., before being shipped on to some other country. The entrepôt trade may make use of such a port because it is conveniently situated on shipping lanes and has the warehouses and customs facilities required for re-export or because that port is the centre of the particular trade concerned and facilities are available there for sampling, testing, auctioning, breaking bulk, etc. Much entrepôt trade used to pass through London, but since the decline of the London docks other European ports, such as Rotterdam, have taken its place. Singapore and Hong Kong are also centres of the entrepôt trade.
