- Phasor measurement units (PMUs) are devices used to detect electrical waveforms in order to analyze power grid systems and detect potential issues. A phasor is a mathematical way to describe the shape of a waveform. A PMU can measure quantities of the waveform by its magnitude and phase angle of a voltage. Data is time-stamped using GPS to synchronize measurements across a power line or grid. These measurements are called synchrophasors.
