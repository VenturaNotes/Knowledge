- An open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment that executes JavaScript code outside a browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command-line tools and for server-side scripting to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the userâ€™s web browser.
## Source[^2]
- Node.js, commonly referred to as Node, is a single thread, open-source platform that was made for building scalable server-side and network applications. Node.js allows developers to use JavaScript to write command line tools for server-side scripting. Instead of following the traditional receive, process, send, wait, and receive workflow that most code follows, Node.js processes incoming requests in a constant event stack. Node.js sends small requests to the receiving server, one after another without waiting for responses. Since Node.js uses fewer threads, it utilizes much fewer computer memory/resources, resulting in quicker task execution.
