- $n$. (in embryology) the process of repeated cell division of the fertilized egg to form a ball of cells that becomes the blastocyst. The cells (blastomeres) do not grow between divisions and so they decrease in size.
## Source[^2]
- (in embryology) The series of cell divisions by which a single fertilized egg cell is transformed into a multicellular body, the blastula. Characteristically no growth occurs during cleavage, the shape of the embryo is unchanged except for the formation of a central cavity (the blastocoel), and the ratio of nuclear material (DNA) to cytoplasm increases.
