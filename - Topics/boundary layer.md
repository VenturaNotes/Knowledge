- In fluid dynamics, a boundary layer is a thin layer of fluid close to a surface where the effects of viscosity are important. The Navier-Stokes equations can then be separately analyzed in the boundary layer, where the thinness of the layer is to some extent negligible, and outside the boundary layer, where the effects of viscosity are negligible.
