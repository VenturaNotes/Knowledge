- A process in which the various possible developments in an industry are examined, together with a company's ability to respond flexibly and creatively. Expert opinion is used to formulate a qualitative view of the future; this will usually identify major trends and analyze longterm environmental influences but will not involve use of historical data in an attempt to 'predict' future events. By examining a range of possible scenarios managers should be able to assess the strategic options available and evaluate existing assumptions and practices. See also Delphi TECHNIQUE; STRATEGIC CHOICE.

- A method for the assessment of a risky investment project based on information about possible realizations for some, or all, macroeconomic and project-specific factors that determine the value of the project. A variant of scenario analysis is best-case/worst-case analysis, where each factor is assumed to take the best possible value and the worst possible value; the difference between the values of the project for the two cases is used to gauge its riskiness. More generally, a multiple scenario analysis involves calculations of the value of the project for various combinations of realizations for the factors, sometimes taking into account possible comovements of different factors. The expected value of the project can be calculated if the probabilities of all possible outcomes are known.
