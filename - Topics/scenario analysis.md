## Source [^1]
- A process in which the various possible developments in an industry are examined, together with a company's ability to respond flexibly and creatively. Expert opinion is used to formulate a qualitative view of the future; this will usually identify major trends and analyse longterm environmental influences but will not involve use of historical data in an attempt to 'predict' future events. By examining a range of possible scenarios managers should be able to assess the strategic options available and evaluate existing assumptions and practices. See also Delphi TECHNIQUE; STRATEGIC CHOICE.
