- $n$. A research method whose defining features are manipulation of an independent variable or variables and control of extraneous variables that might influence the dependent variable. Control of extraneous variables is often, though not necessarily, achieved through randomization. Experimental methods are uniquely powerful in allowing rigorous examination of causal effects without the uncertainties of other research methods. See also control group, experimental group, HYPOTHETICO-DEDUCTIVE METHOD, RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, RANDOMIZED DOUBLE-BLIND EXPERIMENT. Compare CASE STUDY, CORRELATIONAL STUDY, OBSERVATIONAL STUDY, QUASI-EXPERIMENT, SURVEY RESEARCH. \[From Latin experimentum proof or trial]
