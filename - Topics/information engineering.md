- The engineering approach applied to information systems. The term shows considerable variation in scope. At its broadest, it refers to the engineering discipline covering a spectrum from software engineering and systems engineering to device-level electronics. At its most limited (but perhaps best known), it is the name of a specific proprietary method for the development of organizational information systems, primarily associated with Clive Finklestein and James Martin; this method begins with enterprise modelling and carries through to the generation of program code, and a number of software toolsets are available for its support.
## Source[^2]
- Information engineering, or IE, is an approach to creating information systems. IE involves creating data pipelines that connect data sources to the information system. They may also link into a data lake or data warehouse. Information engineers, also called data engineers, focus on the resilience of a system, data security, and scalability. They may design the system in line with business goals, using data modeling and process modeling practices. IE may also be referred to as information technology engineering or ITE.
