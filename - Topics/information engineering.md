- The engineering approach applied to information systems. The term shows considerable variation in scope. At its broadest, it refers to the engineering discipline covering a spectrum from software engineering and systems engineering to device-level electronics. At its most limited (but perhaps best known), it is the name of a specific proprietary method for the development of organizational information systems, primarily associated with Clive Finklestein and James Martin; this method begins with enterprise modelling and carries through to the generation of program code, and a number of software toolsets are available for its support.
