## Source [^1]
- A process in which very high volumes are produced on dedicated plant continuously, e.g. cement production or electricity generation. The plant usually involves very high capital expenditure. Unplanned shut-downs are very costly, typically involving a major refurbishment, for example to replace cracked furnace linings. Most continuous processes are largely self-controlling or are monitored by computer (see COMPUTER-AIDED MANUFACTURING) with only minor operator involvement. The product is often made to stock and is therefore vulnerable to market fluctuations. Compare BATCH PRODUCTION. See PROCESS CHOICE.
