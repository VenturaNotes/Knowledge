- A type of machine learning. Biological immune systems are natural adaptive learning systems that use a variety of mechanisms to defend an organism from invading pathogens. Artificial immune systems are inspired by processes identified within animal immune systems. They attempt to learn and recognize patterns for use in applications such as anomaly recognition, fault detection, security, and optimization.
