- An important technique in experimental design for reducing the number of treatment combinations tested, allowing more factors to be included in the experiment without increasing the number of observations. For example, seven factors at two levels each may be tested on a balanced set of 32 combinations without loss of important information, compared with the full set of 128 combinations.
