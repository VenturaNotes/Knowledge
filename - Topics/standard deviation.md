- A measure of the dispersion of statistical data. For a series of $n$ values $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{n}$, it is given by the formula$$\sqrt{ }\left[(1 / n) \sum\left(x_{i}-x\right)\right]$$where $x$ is the average of the $n$ values. The standard deviation of the returns from an investment can be used as a measure of the risk associated with that investment.
## Source[^2]
- In a sample of observations, a commonly used measure of dispersion, defined as the square root of the average of squared deviations of the observations from the sample mean. In a population, the square root of the variance of the distribution.
## Source[^3]
- (in statistics) a measure of the dispersion of data about their arithmetic mean, which is calculated from the square root of the variance of the readings in the series. The arithmetic sum of the amounts by which each observation varies from the mean must be zero, but if these variations are squared before being summated, a positive value is obtained: the mean of this value is the variance. (In practice a more reliable estimate of variance is obtained by dividing the sum of the squared deviations by one less than the total number of observations.) A large standard deviation indicates that data points vary across a wide range of values, whereas a small standard deviation indicates the opposite. See also SIGNIFICANCE.
