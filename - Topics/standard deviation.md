- A measure of the dispersion of statistical data. For a series of $n$ values $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{n}$, it is given by the formula$$\sqrt{ }\left[(1 / n) \sum\left(x_{i}-x\right)\right]$$where $x$ is the average of the $n$ values. The standard deviation of the returns from an investment can be used as a measure of the risk associated with that investment.
## Source[^2]
- In a sample of observations, a commonly used measure of dispersion, defined as the square root of the average of squared deviations of the observations from the sample mean. In a population, the square root of the variance of the distribution.
