- $n$. An increase in sexual responsiveness and reduction in the sexual refractory period (1) resulting from the arrival of a new mating partner. \[Named after US President Calvin Coolidge (1872-1933) and the following apocryphal story, which is seldom recounted in print. During a visit to an egg farm with her husband in the 1920s, Mrs Coolidge, the First Lady, was impressed by the frequency with which the roosters were mating with the hens, and she pointedly asked an aide to draw this to the attention of her husband. President Coolidge enquired whether each rooster always mated with the same hen, and the reply came that, to maintain the high frequency of mating, each rooster had to be paired with a new hen every few days. The President asked the aide to draw this to the attention of his wife.]
