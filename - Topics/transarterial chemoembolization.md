- (TACE) an interventional radiology procedure to treat liver cancer in which a chemotherapeutic agent (usually doxyrubicin) loaded onto tiny beads is directly delivered to the cancerous area. This involves passing a catheter through the femoral artery in the groin and selectively placing it into the hepatic artery. A minute catheter (microcatheter) is then placed through the existing catheter and advanced more selectively into the area of cancer. Thus, the chemotherapy-loaded beads can be administered directly to the cancer, where they can not only treat it but also block the blood supply to that area (embolization).
