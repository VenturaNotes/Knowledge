- A permutation $f$ of a set S is a cycle if there are elements $s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$ such that $f(s_1) = s_2, f(s_2) = s_3, ,,, f(s_{n-1}) = s_n, f(s_n) = s_1$ and $f$ fixes all other elements. $n$ is called the length of $f$ and equals the order of $f$ as an element of the symmetry group of S. The cycle $f$ is denoted as $(s_1 s_2 ... s_n)$.

	- #question Shouldn't there be commas in $(s_1s_2...s_n)$?
