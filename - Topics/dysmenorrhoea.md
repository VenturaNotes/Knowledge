- $n$. menstruation that is associated with cramping low abdominal pain radiating into the lower back and thighs; the pain sometimes precedes menstrual flow. In primary dysmenorrhoea the painful periods begin soon after menarche and are associated with increased production of prostaglandin $\mathrm{F}_{2 \alpha}$ by the endometrium. Secondary dysmenorrhoea is caused by organic pelvic disease, such as fibroids or endometriosis.
