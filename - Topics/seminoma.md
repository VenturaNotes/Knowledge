- $n$. a malignant tumor of the testis, appearing as a swelling, often painless, in the scrotum. It tends to occur in an older age group than the teratomas. The treatment for localized disease is surgery involving removal of the testis (see ORCHIDECTOMY). Secondary tumors in the lungs can be treated with chemotherapy and radiotherapy to the draining lymph nodes. A similar tumour occurs in the ovary (see DYSGERMINOMA).
