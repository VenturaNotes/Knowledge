- Things which the law recognizes as belonging exclusively to particular individuals or organizations. This is contrasted with things which are owned by the government, such as public highways, and things which are held to be available for use by anybody, for example the works of authors whose copyright has expired. Things which are private property can be legally transferred only with the owner's consent, or by due legal process, for example compulsory purchase of land needed for public works. There are often restrictions on the use which can be made of private property, to avoid danger or inconvenience to other people: for example, planning permission is required for building on private land.
