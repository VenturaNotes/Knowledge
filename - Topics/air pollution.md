- (atmospheric pollution) The release into the atmosphere of substances that cause a variety of harmful effects to the natural environment. Most air pollutants are gases that are released into the troposphere, which extends about 8 km above the surface of the earth. The burning of fossil fuels, for example in power stations, is a major source of air pollution as this process produces such gases as sulphur dioxide and carbon dioxide. Released into the atmosphere, carbon dioxide is the major contributor to the greenhouse effect. Methane, derived from livestock and rice cultivation, is another significant greenhouse gas. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, released in car exhaust fumes, are air pollutants that are responsible for the formation of acid rain; nitrogen oxides also contribute to the formation of photochemical smog. See also OZONE LAYER; POLLUTION.
