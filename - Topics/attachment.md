- (1) A procedure enabling a creditor, who has obtained judgment in the courts (the judgment creditor), to secure payment of the amount due from the debtor. The judgment creditor obtains a further court order to the effect that money or property due from a third party to the debtor must be frozen and paid instead to the judgment creditor to satisfy the amount due. For instance, a judgment creditor may, through a third-party debt order, attach the salary due to the debtor from the debtor's employer.
