- A line $l$ is an asymptote to a curve if the distance from a point $P$ to the line $l$ tends to zero as $P$ tends to infinity along some unbounded part of the curve. Consider the following examples:$$(i)~ y=\frac{x+3}{(x+2)(x-1)},

(ii)~ y=\frac{3 x^{2}}{x^{2}+x+1},

(iii) ~ y=\frac{x^{3}}{x^{2}+x+1}.$$Example (i) has $x=-2$ and $x=1$ as vertical asymptotes and $y=0$ as a horizontal asymptote. Example (ii) has no vertical asymptotes and $y=3$ as a horizontal asymptote. To investigate example (iii), it can be rewritten as$$y=x-1+\frac{1}{x^{2}+x+1}$$Then it can be seen that $y=x-1$ is a slant (or oblique) asymptote, that is, an asymptote that is neither vertical nor horizontal.
