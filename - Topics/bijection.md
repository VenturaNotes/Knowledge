## Source [^1]
- A function that is both [[injection|1-1]] and [[surjection|onto]]
	- This means it has a perfect "pairing" between elements of the domain and codomain
- Every element of the domain maps uniquely to an element of the codomain, and every element of the codomain is mapped to by some element of the domain

## Source[^2]
- (one-to-one onto function) A function that is both an injection and a surjection. if

  

$$

f: X \rightarrow Y

$$

  

is a bijection, then for each $y$ in $Y$ there is a unique $x$ in $X$ with the property that

  

$$

y=f(x)

$$

  

i.e. there is a one-to-one correspondence between the elements in $X$ and the elements in $Y$. The sets $X$ and $Y$ will have the same number of elements, i.e. the same cardinality. There will be a unique function

  

$$

f^{-1}: Y \rightarrow X

$$

  

such that $f$ and $f^{-1}$ are inverses to each other; $f^{-1}$ will also be a bijection.
