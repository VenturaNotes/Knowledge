- A sales channel refers to any medium by which businesses sell products and services to customers or other businesses (business-to-business). B2B sales channels include phone calls, emails and in-person networking, while B2C (business-to-consumer) sales channels include eCommerce, physical retail, and product catalogs. Sales channels can be direct (e.g. a product showroom operated by the business) or indirect (e.g. listing products on an online marketplace like Amazon). The notion of a sales channel is contrasted with marketing channels, which are how businesses market their products, such as content marketing or TV ads.
