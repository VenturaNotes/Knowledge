- A restricted type of context-free grammar, namely one in which each production has the form$$A \rightarrow BC \text{ or } A \rightarrow d$$i.e. each right-hand side consists of either two nonterminals or one terminal. Any context-free language is generated by such a grammar, except that derivation of the empty string, $\Lambda$, requires the additional production$$S \rightarrow \Lambda$$
