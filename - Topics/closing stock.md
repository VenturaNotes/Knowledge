- The stock remaining within an organization at the end of an accounting period as raw materials, work in progress, or finished goods. It is necessary to establish the level of closing stocks so that the cost of their creation is not charged against the profits of the period (see OPENING STOCK). Closing stocks are therefore valued and deducted from the costs of the period and appear as current assets in the balance sheet.
