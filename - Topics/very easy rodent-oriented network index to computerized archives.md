- (the reference to rodents being related to the Gopher system). An information-retrieval tool on the Internet. A Veronica server holds an index of Gopher server systems, which can be accessed using Gopher on a workstation; the result of a search of the index is a menu of Gopher server systems that contain relevant information, and this menu can then be used by the workstation to connect directly to the Gopher servers. The use of Veronica declined with that of Gopher.
