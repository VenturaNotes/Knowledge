See also Lloyd Morgan's canon. \[Named after the English philosopher William of Ockham (?1285-?1349), so called because he was born in the English village of Ockham, near Guildford, Surrey, perhaps the most influential of the later medieval philosophers, although the words attributed to him are not found in any of his surviving works]
