- n. a small parasitic whiplike nematode worm, Trichuris trichiura (Trichocephalus dispar), that lives in the large intestine. Eggs are passed out of the body with the faeces and human infection (see TRICHURIASIS) results from the consumption of water or food contaminated with faecal material. The eggs hatch in the small intestine but mature worms migrate to the large intestine.
