- The proportion of labour in the total inputs to a productive process. A process is called labour-intensive if the ratio of labour to other inputs is large relative to other production processes. When a production process permits substitution between inputs, labour intensity can be varied in response to changes in the relation between real wages and the cost of using other inputs.
