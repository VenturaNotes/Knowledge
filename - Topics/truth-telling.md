## Synthesis

- $n$. telling the facts openly, honestly, and unambiguously. Clinicians should speak truthfully to their patients unless there are acceptable justifications not to do so that respect the patient's autonomy. Without knowing what is wrong, for instance, a patient cannot make a choice of treatments or decide whether to be treated at all. Candour or openness is a requirement of professionalism but does not extend to inappropriate revelations from clinicians about their personal lives. See also THERAPEUTIC PRIVILEGE.
