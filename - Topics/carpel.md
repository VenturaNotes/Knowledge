- The female reproductive organ of a flower. Typically it consists of a stigma, style, and ovary. It is thought to have evolved by the fusion of the two edges of a flattened megasporophyll (see SPOROPHYLL). Each flower may have one carpel (monocarpellary) or many (polycarpellary), either free (apocarpous) or fused together (syncarpous). See also pistil.
