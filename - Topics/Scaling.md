	- Scaling: Multiply a row by a non-zero constant
	- This is a [[Gaussian operations|row operation]]

## Source[^2]
- The adjustment of values to be used in a computation so that they and their resultant are within the range that can be handled by the process or equipment. The scaling factor is reapplied to correct the result before output or—if this is not possible—it is output as a qualifier with the result
