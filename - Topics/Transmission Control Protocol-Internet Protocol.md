- Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (or TCP/IP) is a set of rules for the seven-layer Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) network model. In a network model, a "layer" is another word for an application. The U.S. Department of Defense developed the TCP/IP over 15 years, and it is now viewed as the unofficial standard for network and transport layers.
