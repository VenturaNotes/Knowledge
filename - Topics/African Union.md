- (AU) An organization of African States created in 2001 as the successor to the Organization of African Unity (OAU) (formed in 1963). It aims to extend the OAU's policy of seeking cooperative solutions to the continent's political and economic problems, with the longerterm goal of establishing an economic union and a Pan-African parliament. All African states are members. Morocco was readmitted in 2017 (having left in 1984 over disputed Western Sahara) while the membership of the Central African Republic is currently in suspension.
