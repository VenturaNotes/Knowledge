- the 31 pairs of nerves that leave the spinal cord and are distributed to the body, passing out from the vertebral canal through the spaces between the arches of the vertebrae (see illustration). Each nerve has two roots, an anterior, carrying motor nerve fibers, and a posterior, carrying sensory fibers. Immediately after the roots leave the spinal cord they merge to form a mixed spinal nerve on each side.

## Source[^2]
- Pairs of nerves that arise from the spinal cord (compare CRANIAL NERVES). In humans there are 31 pairs (one from each of the vertebrae). Each nerve arises from a dorsal root and a ventral root and contains both motor and sensory fibers (i.e. they are mixed nerves). The spinal nerves form an important part of the peripheral nervous system.
