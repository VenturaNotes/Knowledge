## Source [^1]
- The temperature scale, and the unit of measurement of temperature, which takes $0\degree K = -273.15\degree C$ as absolute zero, the lowest possible temperature, at which all thermodynamic motion has ceased. Then 1$\degree$K equals 1$\degree$C as a temperature difference
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the SI unit of temperature, formally defined as the fraction 1/273.16 of the temperature of the triple point of water. A temperature in kelvins is equal to a Celsius temperature plus $273.15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Symbol: K.
## Source[^3]
- Symbol K. The SI unit of thermodynamic temperature equal to the fraction 1/273.16 of the thermodynamic temperature of the triple point of water. The magnitude of the kelvin is equal to that of the degree Celsius (centigrade), but a temperature expressed in degrees Celsius is numerically equal to the temperature in kelvins less 273.15 (i.e. ${ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}=\mathrm{K}$ -273.15). The unit is named after Lord Kelvin (1824-1907).
