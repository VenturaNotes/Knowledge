- a malignant disease of lymphatic tissue $\textendash$ a form of lymphoma $\textendash$ usually characterized by painless enlargement of one or more groups of lymph nodes in the neck, axillae (armpits), groin, chest, or abdomen; the spleen, liver, bone marrow, and bones may also be involved. Apart from the enlarging nodes, there may also be weight loss, fever, profuse sweating at night, and itching (known as B symptoms). Hodgkin's disease is distinguished from other forms of lymphoma by the presence of large binucleate cells (Reed-Sternberg cells) in the affected lymph nodes. Treatment depends on the extent of disease and may include surgery, radiotherapy, drug therapy, or a combination of these. Drugs used in the treatment of the disease include vincristine, procarbazine, prednisolone, chlorambucil, and vinblastine. Many patients can be cured; in the early stages of the disease this may be in the order of $90 \%$ or more. \[T. Hodgkin (1798-1866), British physician]
