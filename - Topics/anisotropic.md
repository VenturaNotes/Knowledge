- adj. Having different physical properties in different directions or with respect to different axes. Compare isotropic. anisotropy or anisotrophy $n$. \[From Greek anisos unequal, from an- without + isos equal or the same + tropos a turn, from trepein to turn]
## Source[^2]
- Denoting a medium in which certain physical properties are different in different directions. Wood, for instance, is an anisotropic material: its strength along the grain differs from that perpendicular to the grain. Single crystals that are not cubic are anisotropic with respect to some physical properties, such as the transmission of electromagnetic radiation. Compare isotropic.
