- A homomorphism that, when viewed as a function, is a bijection. If$$\upvarphi: G \rightarrow H$$is an isomorphism then the algebras $G$ and $H$ are said to be isomorphic and so exhibit the same algebraic properties. Isomorphic trees are trees that are isomorphic as directed graphs.

- $n$. the condition of two or more objects being alike in shape or structure. It can exist at any structural level, from molecules to whole organisms. -isomorphic, $\textemdash$isomorphous adj.

- $n$. 
- (1) A one-to-one correspondence between the elements of two or more sets or classes and between the sums or products of the elements of one set and the sums or products of the equivalent elements of the other set. A typical isormorphism exists between the Arabic numerals 1, 2, 3, 4, ... and the Roman numerals I, II, III, IV, ... . 
- (2) A similarity in form or structure between two or more substances or entities, including abstract structures or problems that look superficially different but turn out, on analysis, to be different versions of the same problem. See also Boolean. 
- (3) The doctrine of Gestalt psychology according to which a mental experience such as a perception is invariably accompanied by a neurophysiological representation (1) that is similar to it in structure. The idea can be traced to an article by the Austrian physicist, philosopher, and psychologist Ernst Mach (1838-1916) in the Kaiserlichen Akademie der Wissenschaften (1865): 'Every psychical event corresponds to a physical event and vice versa. Equal psychical processes correspond to equal physical processes, unequal to unequal ones' (p. 269 of the English translation published in 1965, italics in original). This notion was developed and imported into Gestalt psychology by the German psychologist Wolfgang Köhler (1887-1967), who asserted in his book Gestalt Psychology (1947) that 'the principle of isomorphism demands that in a given case the organization of experience and the underlying physiological facts have the same structure' (p. 301). See also Prägnanz. isomorph $n$. Anything that exhibits isomorphism with something else. See also isogloss. isomorphic adj. Manifesting isomorphism. Also called isophorphous. \[From Greek isos equal or the same + morphe a shape or form + -ismos indicating a state or condition]
