- Bitcoin mining is facilitated by a global network of computers that ensure bitcoin transactions are valid and correctly added to the blockchain. Bitcoin miners use software applications to solve transaction-related cryptographic algorithms that check the validity of bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin miners are often rewarded a varying number of bitcoin per block mined. This encourages bitcoin miners to continue verifying bitcoin transactions, upholding the overall digital ledger system.
