- The legal right of a lender of money if the borrower fails to repay the money or part of it on the due date. The lender must apply to a court to be permitted to sell the property that has been held as security for the debt. The court will order a new date for payment in an order called a foreclosure nisi. If the borrower again fails to pay, the lender may sell the property. This procedure can occur when a mortgagor fails to pay the mortgagee (bank, building society, etc.) the mortgage instalments, in which the security is the house in which the mortgagor lives. The bank, etc., then forecloses the mortgage, dispossessing the mortgagor.

- Taking over by a lender of a mortgaged property, because of failure by the borrower to comply with the conditions of the mortgage. This failure usually consists of failure to make interest and amortization payments by the due dates. Foreclosure is usually only resorted to by lenders when considerable arrears have arisen, and normally requires authorization by a court. In the UK the term is repossession.

- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a defence mechanism, first identified in 1956 by the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (1901-81), involving the expulsion of a fundamental signifier, such as the phallus as a fundamental signifier of the castration complex, from a person's symbolic universe. It may be a defence mechanism specific to psychosis (1), and it differs from repression inasmuch as the foreclosed signifier is not integrated into the person's unconscious and does not re-emerge from within as a neurotic (1) symptom but may return in the form of a psychotic (1) hallucination. The idea is traceable to an article in 1894 by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) on 'The Neuro-Psychoses of Defence' (Standard Edition, III, pp. 45-61): 'There is, however, a much more energetic and successful kind of defence. Here, the ego rejects the incompatible idea together with its affect and behaves as if the idea had never occurred to the ego at all' (p. 58).
