- Conditions which must be satisfied for something to be true (necessary) and, if satisfied, imply that it must be true (sufficient). Consider propositions $B$ and $C$. ' $B$ is a sufficient condition for $C$ ' means that if $B$ is true, $C$ is always true. ' $B$ is a necessary condition for $C$ ' means that $C$ cannot be true unless $B$ is true. A condition can be sufficient but not necessary: if $B$ is a sufficient condition for $C, C$ cannot be false when $B$ is true, but $C$ could well be true when $B$ is false. It is possible for the same condition to be both necessary and sufficient; this means that $B$ is true if and only if (written iff) $C$ is true. Thus, if $B$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for $C, C$ must likewise be a necessary and sufficient condition for $B$; the two statements are equivalent.
