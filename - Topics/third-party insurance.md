- Insurance of a person's legal liabilities to others. The insurer and the policyholder are the two parties to the insurance contract, any other person to whom there is a legal obligation is therefore a third party. Some forms of third-party insurance are compulsory, e.g. motorists must have third-party cover for any loss or damage suffered by members of the public as a result of their driving and employers must cover against any results of injury to employees at work. Professional indemnity insurance is a form of third-party insurance that is optional.

- Insurance against the cost of compensating third parties, that is, individuals or companies other than the insurance company and the policy-holder, for death, injury, or damage to property. UK car drivers are legally obliged to hold third-party insurance, whereas they are left to decide for themselves whether to insure against fire, theft, and accident. In contrast, some US states do not require car drivers to have any insurance.
