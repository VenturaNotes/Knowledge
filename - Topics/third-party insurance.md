- Insurance of a person's legal liabilities to others. The insurer and the policyholder are the two parties to the insurance contract, any other person to whom there is a legal obligation is therefore a third party. Some forms of third-party insurance are compulsory, e.g. motorists must have third-party cover for any loss or damage suffered by members of the public as a result of their driving and employers must cover against any results of injury to employees at work. Professional indemnity insurance is a form of third-party insurance that is optional.
