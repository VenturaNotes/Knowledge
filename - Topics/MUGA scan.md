- (multiple-gated acquisition scan) a technique used in nuclear medicine for studying the left-ventricular function and wall motion of the heart. The patient's red cells are labelled with radioactive technetium99m. A gamma camera, connected to an ECG, collects information over a prolonged period for each phase of heart movement (ECG gating) to form an image of the blood pool within the heart at specific points in the cardiac cycle. Tomographic reconstructions can be made to give cross-sectional images of the heart in different phases of the cardiac cycle, using reconstruction algorithms comparable to CT scanning (see SPECT SCANNING).
