- $n$. any substance that, when exposed to living tissue, may cause the production of cancer. Known carcinogens include ionizing radiation and many chemicals, e.g. those found in cigarette smoke and those produced in certain industries. They cause damage to the DNA of cells that may persist if the cell divides before the damage is repaired. Damaged cells may subsequently develop into a cancer (see also CARCINOGENESIS). An inherent susceptibility to cancer may be necessary for a carcinogen to promote the development of cancer. See also ONCOGENIC. $\textemdash$ carcinogenic adj.
