- (masquerade) A type of cyberattack that involves altering electronic information so that the recipient is deceived into behaving in a way that they otherwise would not. Typically, the malicious information is forged to look very similar to a familiar or trusted source. A very popular form of semantic attack is semantic URL attack, in which an attacker forges a URL that looks similar to that of an official website and then uses it in a spam email. The link may then simply redirect the user to some unexpected website, or trigger the execution of a malicious code. Phishing and social engineering scams are examples of semantic attack.
