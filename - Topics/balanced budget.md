- A balanced budget occurs when total government receipts and expenditure are equal. There is thus no need for additional government borrowing so government debt remains constant. The UK Labor government of 1997-2010 imposed the golden rule that the budget need not balance every year but current receipts and expenditure had to be balanced on average over an economic cycle.
