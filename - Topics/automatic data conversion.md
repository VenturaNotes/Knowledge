- The conversion of data from one form to another without any direct action by the programmer, e.g. decimal integers on input to stored form of integer. Such facilities are commonly available for individual items of data in modern programming languages. Many database input systems carry out more complex transformations of the data, and at the extreme may translate data from the format of one database system to another.
