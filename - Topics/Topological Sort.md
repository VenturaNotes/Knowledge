- A sorting process over which a partial ordering is defined, i.e. ordering is given over pairs of items but not between all of them. An example is given by a dictionary. If a word $v$ is defined in terms of word $w$, this is denoted by $w<v$. Then a topological sort of the dictionary implies an ordering of the terms so that there will be no forward references.
