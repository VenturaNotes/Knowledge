- Allowances that may be deducted from a taxpayer's gross income before calculating the liability to income tax. Every individual who is a UK resident is entitled to a personal allowance. After 5 April 2000 the former married couple's allowance was discontinued for all couples in which the elder spouse was under 65 on that date; if one spouse was born before 6 April 1935, the allowance is a maximum of $£ 8,439$ (2016-17), relief for this amount being available at a rate of $10 \%$. From April 2015 either spouse in such a marriage may choose to transfer up to $10 \%$ of their personal allowance to their partner (but not where one or both pays higher-rate tax). There is also a registered blind person's allowance of $£ 2,290$. For savings income, there is now an allowance of $£ 1,000$ ( $£ 500$ for higher-rate tax payers). From April 2016 there is an allowance of $£ 5,000$ for dividend income (see DIVIDEND TAX).
