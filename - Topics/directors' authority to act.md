- In law, a director's power to act on behalf of a company may be based on actual or apparent authority. Actual authority is either express or implied. Express authority is an explicit conferring of authority on a director from, for example, the articles of association or a contract of employment. Implied authority comprises usual authority (i.e. those powers that fall within the usual scope of the office to which the individual has been appointed) or authority based on the conduct of the parties. Apparent (or ostensible) authority is the authority of an agent as it appears to others-i.e. the particular agent has been held out by their principal as possessing the requisite authority.
