- A market in which there are multiple buyers but only one seller, who is thus largely able to control the terms of trade (e.g. price). Governments usually try to eliminate monopolies as being against the public interest. In recent decades some of the services formerly regarded as natural monopolies, such as electricity and water supply, have been privatized to encourage competition and eliminate the monopolistic element. See also CARTEL; CORNER; OLIGOPOLY.
