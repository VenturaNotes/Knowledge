- a network of vessels that conveys electrolytes, water, proteins, etc. $\textendash$ in the form of lymph $\textendash$ from the tissue fluids to the bloodstream (see illustration). It consists of fine blind-ended lymphatic capillaries, which unite to form lymphatic vessels. At various points along the lymphatic vessels are lymph nodes. Lymph drains into the capillaries and passes into the lymphatic vessels, which have valves to prevent backflow of lymph. The lymphatics lead to two large channels $\textendash$ the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct $\textendash$ which return the lymph to the bloodstream via the innominate veins.
