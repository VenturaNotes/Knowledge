- a network of vessels that conveys electrolytes, water, proteins, etc. $\textendash$ in the form of lymph $\textendash$ from the tissue fluids to the bloodstream (see illustration). It consists of fine blind-ended lymphatic capillaries, which unite to form lymphatic vessels. At various points along the lymphatic vessels are lymph nodes. Lymph drains into the capillaries and passes into the lymphatic vessels, which have valves to prevent backflow of lymph. The lymphatics lead to two large channels $\textendash$ the thoracic duct and the right lymphatic duct $\textendash$ which return the lymph to the bloodstream via the innominate veins.

## Source[^2]
- The network of vessels that conveys lymph from the tissue fluids to the bloodstream. Tiny lacteals (in the small intestine) and lymph capillaries (in other tissues) drain into larger tubular vessels that converge to form the right lymphatic duct and the thoracic duct, which connect with the venous blood supply to the heart. Associated with the lymphatic vessels at intervals along the system are the lymph nodes. The lymph capillary walls are very permeable, so lymph bathing the body's tissues can drain away molecules that are too large to pass through blood capillary walls. In most vertebrates lymph is pumped by cycles of contraction and relaxation of the lymphatic vessels and also by the action of adjoining muscles. See also LYMPH HEART.
