- A means of locating data items, usually files. A directory can be regarded as establishing a set of links between named data items and their locations in a direct-access storage device. In many systems the directories are highly structured; their organization reflects the relationships between various categories of file. For example, the directory may allow one user to have other subordinate users, and permit controlled access by these subordinate users to their own and others' files.
- A directory may contain the names of files and of other directories. For instance, if directory x contained directory y , which contained file z , then it would be necessary to include $\mathrm{x}, \mathrm{y}$, and z in any reference to the file. See also ACCESS PATH.

- A web site that provides a structured listing of links to other sites in different categories. Yahoo! and the Open Directory Project are the best known examples of web directories. The distinction between a search engine and a directory has to some extent become blurred, since many sites now include both facilities as part of a portal service.
