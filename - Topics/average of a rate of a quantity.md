- The constant value for which the total change in the interval would have been the same as that observed. For example, a car may vary its instantaneous speed in the duration of a journey, but the average speed $=$ total distance traveled/time of journey. In the case of velocity, the average is a vector, namely total displacement divided by total time taken.
