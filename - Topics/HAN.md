- heroin-associated nephropathy: a syndrome of massive proteinuria, hypoalbuminuria, and hyperlipidaemia, with or without oedema, seen after prolonged intravenous addiction to heroin. Renal biopsies show the changes of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis but the condition does not respond to immunosuppressant treatment and progresses to end-stage renal failure.
