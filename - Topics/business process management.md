- Business process management (BPM) is an organized method for overseeing ongoing, repetitive, predictable operations, and procedures that are essential to a business. BPM is often confused with project or task management, but the terms are not interchangeable. BPM monitors and analyzes the core models used for overall business success based on hard data. Project management, on the other hand, is used for specific workflows that take place as needed within the business structure. BPM also analyzes variables by incorporating sets of rules and standard fallbacks or alternative plans. It is often aided by the use of technology and software.
