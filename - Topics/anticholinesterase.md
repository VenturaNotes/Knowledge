- $n$. any substance that inhibits the action of cholinesterase, the enzyme that is responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, and therefore allows acetylcholine to continue transmitting nerve impulses. Drugs with anticholinesterase activity include neostigmine, pyridostigmine, and edrophonium; their uses include the diagnosis and treatment of myasthenia gravis. See also PARASYMPATHOMIMETIC.
## Source[^2]
- Any substance that inhibits the enzyme cholinesterase, which is responsible for the breakdown of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine at nerve synapses. Anticholinesterases, which include certain drugs, nerve gases, and insecticides, cause a buildup of acetylcholine within the synapses, leading to disruption of nerve and muscle function. In vertebrates, these agents often cause death by paralysing the respiratory muscles. See pesticide.
