The term was coined in 1910 by the Swiss psychiatrist Eugen Bleuler (1857-1939), who considered ambivalence to be a major sign of schizophrenia, and Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced it into psychoanalysis in an article in 1912 on 'The Dynamics of Transferenceâ€™ (Standard Edition, XII, pp. 98-108). See also DEFUSION OF INSTINCTS, DEPRESSIVE POSITION, PARANOID-SCHIZOID POSITION. ambivalent adj. \[From Latin ambi- both + valens being strong, from valere to be strong]
