- a form of chorea that mainly affects children and adolescents, especially females. It can occur some months after an infection caused by $\beta$-haemolytic streptococci (such as rheumatic fever or scarlet fever), causing uncontrolled movements of the muscles of the shoulders, hips, and face (hence the archaic name, St Vitus' dance). Formerly a frightening disease, it is now readily cured by antibiotics. \[G. Sydenham (1624-89), English physician]
