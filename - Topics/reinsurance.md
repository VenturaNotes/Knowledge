- The passing of all or part of an insurance risk that has been covered by an insurer to another insurer in return for a premium. The contract between the parties is usually known as a reinsurance treaty. The policyholder is usually not aware that reinsurance has been arranged, as no mention is made of it on the policy. Reinsurance is a similar process to the bookmaker's practice of laying off bets with other bookmakers when too much money is placed on a particular horse. Very often an insurer will only accept a risk with a high payout if a total loss occurs (e.g. for a jumbo jet) in the sure knowledge that the potential loss can be reduced by reinsurance. See also FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE.

- The system by which the issuers of insurance policies pass on part of the risk to others, by themselves taking out further insurance policies. Reinsurance generally applies only to claims on a policy or group of policies in excess of some minimum amount. This limits the insurer's maximum possible losses if claims on the policies turn out to be higher than expected: it is thus a method of risk-spreading.
