- The passing of all or part of an insurance risk that has been covered by an insurer to another insurer in return for a premium. The contract between the parties is usually known as a reinsurance treaty. The policyholder is usually not aware that reinsurance has been arranged, as no mention is made of it on the policy. Reinsurance is a similar process to the bookmaker's practice of laying off bets with other bookmakers when too much money is placed on a particular horse. Very often an insurer will only accept a risk with a high payout if a total loss occurs (e.g. for a jumbo jet) in the sure knowledge that the potential loss can be reduced by reinsurance. See also FACULTATIVE REINSURANCE.
