- The traditional approach to genetic investigation, in which the aim is to identify the gene that governs a particular function. Mutant phenotypes provide clues about genetically controlled functions, and co-inherited genetic markers indicate the region of the genome containing the responsible gene. This information enables the gene to be isolated and cloned, for example using positional cloning, and its base sequence determined. Compare REVERSE GENETICS.
