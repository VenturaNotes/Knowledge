- RDM tools collate data on a specific project or piece of software. The tools use this data to present a logical database of the projectâ€™s requirements in a format that everyone involved can access and understand. Stakeholders are able to see exactly what is needed and work collaboratively to make it happen. RDM tools may use classic databases and typically incorporate visual representations such as graphs and charts as well as simulations of different scenarios.
