- A naturally occurring mixture of hydrocarbons secreted by many trees (especially conifers) into ducts or canals. Resins comprise chiefly terpenes, and are found either as brittle glassy substances or dissolved in essential oils. Their functions are similar to those of gums and mucilages, i.e. protecting the plant from predators such as wood-boring insects. Compare PHYTONCIDE.
## Source[^2]
- A synthetic or naturally occurring polymer (see Feature entry). Synthetic resins are used in making plastics. Natural resins are acidic chemicals secreted by many trees (especially conifers) into ducts or canals. They are found either as brittle glassy substances or dissolved in essential oils. Their functions are probably similar to those of gums and mucilages.
