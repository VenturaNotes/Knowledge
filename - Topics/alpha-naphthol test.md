- A biochemical test to detect the presence of carbohydrates in solution, also known as Molisch's test (after the Austrian chemist H. Molisch (1856-1937), who devised it). A small amount of alcoholic alpha-naphthol is mixed with the test solution and concentrated sulphuric acid is poured slowly down the side of the test tube. A positive reaction is indicated by the formation of a violet ring at the junction of the two liquids.
