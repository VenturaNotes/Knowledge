- The extent to which a property exhibits a similar value over some spatial region. Spatial coherence is exploited in some illumination calculations in which a scene is broken down into discrete cells that can each be treated as a single entity. The scene is spatially coherent over each cell. The proximity of objects is usually in terms of their positions in object space.
