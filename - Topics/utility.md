- Utility is the benefit associated from consuming an item or service. The level of usefulness of this item or service is what determines its utility. It is the goal of the consumer to gain the most utility out of their purchase as they can. This can refer to a piece of clothing, personal care product, car, house, financial service, and more. It is the goal of the service provider to provide the best customer experience to keep a good relationship and gain referrals. The measure of satisfaction an individual gets from a commodity is extremely important because it determines the reputation of the service provider. Most of the time, services or products that are more expensive will have a higher level of satisfaction and utility. This means that the product or service is of higher quality, so it should deliver favorable results.

- (1) A synonym for individual welfare. Utility can be interpreted literally as a measure of an individual's happiness or, more functionally, as an economist's summary of what guides individual choice. In the first interpretation the writings of 19th-century economists suggest an expectation that a device for measuring utility would eventually emerge from psychological research. This has not yet been realized, but monitoring of brain activity is increasingly part of joint neurological, psychological, and economic research. In the second interpretation utility is used as a tool for constructing a model of individual choice based on the argument that a rational individual will act as if decisions are made to maximize utility. See also CARDINAL UTILITY; EXPECTED UTILITY; MARGINAL UTILITY; ORDINAL UTILITY.
- (2) A public utility, that is, a company that maintains the infrastructure for a public service, and often provides the service using that infrastructure. The public services involving utilities include electricity, water, gas, and transport.
