- A large bundle of nerve fibers, running down the longitudinal axis of the body, that forms an important part of the central nervous system. Most invertebrates have a pair of solid nerve cords, situated ventrally and bearing segmentally arranged ganglia. All animals of the phylum Chordata have a dorsal hollow nerve cord; in vertebrates this is the spinal cord.
