- A country's real gross domestic product per member of the population. This may be calculated using the total population, adults only, or 'adult equivalents', giving children of various ages weights equal to a fraction of an adult. Per capita real GDP is lower than per capita income in a country with net external assets which yield an income, and greater than per capita income in a country with large inward investment, so that net property income payments have to be made abroad.
