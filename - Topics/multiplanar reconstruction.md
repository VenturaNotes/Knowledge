- (MPR) a computer technique that allows images to be created, after the information has been collected (see POSTPROCESSING), in any of the three named planes $\textendash$ axial, sagittal, or coronal $\textendash$ or variations of these, such as oblique or curved planes. The effect is similar to allowing parts of the body to be sliced away, revealing the tissues inside so that they can be studied.
