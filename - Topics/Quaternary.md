- The second and current period of the Cenozoic era, extending from about 2.58 million years ago, following the Neogene period, to the present. The beginning of the Quaternary was based on the onset of a worldwide cooling. During the period four principal glacial phases occurred in Europe and North America, in which ice advanced towards the equator, separated by interglacials during which conditions became warmer and the ice sheets and glaciers retreated. The last glacial ended about 10,000 years ago.
