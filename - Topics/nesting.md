## Synthesis

- A feature of language design in which constructs can be embedded within instances of themselves, e.g. nested loops:
```
while b1 do
begin
	while b2 do
	begin
	...
	end;
end;
```
- Nesting of blocks in block-structured languages provides an elegant, though not entirely practicable, control over the scope of identifiers, since identifiers are local to the innermost level of nesting at which they are declared.
