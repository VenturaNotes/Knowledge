- International paper sizes are based upon a rectangle of paper with an area of one square metre, the sides of which are in the proportion $1: \sqrt{2}$. This geometrical relationship is used so that any lengthways halving of the original rectangle of paper produces another rectangle of paper with the same geometric relationship. For example, the A series is shown here.

- There are three series of international paper size; $\mathrm{A}, \mathrm{B}$, and C. A is the most common series, with A4 being the favored size for business correspondence. The B series is often used for posters, wall charts, other large items and where circumstances dictate a size of paper intermediate between any two adjacent sizes of the A series. The C series is used mainly when it is necessary to fit an envelope inside another envelope. The range and sizes of the three series are as follows:

| A series (mm) |            | B series (mm) |             | C series (mm) |           |
| ------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | ------------- | --------- |
| A0            | 841 x 1189 | B0            | 1000 x 1414 | C4            | 324 x 229 |
| A1            | 594 x 841  | B1            | 707 x 1000  | C5            | 229 x 162 |
