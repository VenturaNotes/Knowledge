- (artefact) $n$. 
- (1) (in radiography) an appearance on an image that is not a true representation of the patient's body part. The cause may be a problem with the radiographic technique or something more straightforward. For example, a movement artifact is blurring of the image due to movement of the patient or organ during the exposure. All imaging techniques, including CT and MRI, are susceptible to a range of artifacts. See also partial VOLUME ARTIFACT. 
- (2) (in microscopy) a structure seen in a tissue under a microscope that is not present in the living tissue. Artifacts, which are produced by faulty fixation or staining of the tissue, may give a false impression that disease or abnormality is present in the tissue when it is not.
