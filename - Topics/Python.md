### Description
- Python doesn't have a strict concept of [[constants]]
	- Conventionally, constants represented using uppercase names to indicate their values should not change

### Initialization
- Refers to the process of assigning an initial value to a variable or setting up an object with default values.
#### Initializing Variables
```python
x = 10          # Integer initialization
y = 3.14        # Float initialization
name = "Alice"  # String initialization
numbers = [1, 2, 3]  # List initialization
settings = {"theme": "dark", "language": "English"}  # Dictionary initialization
```

- Python is a free, open source, multi-purpose programming language that is commonly used for rapid application development (RAD). Python is an extremely versatile programming language that can be used for small tasks, such as creating bots, or larger tasks, such as developing complex code for technical applications. Pythonʻs code can implement both machine learning and data mining, in addition to web page development. Pythonʻs code uses the English language and an easy-to-learn syntax, which makes it an appealing programming language for beginning programmers.
