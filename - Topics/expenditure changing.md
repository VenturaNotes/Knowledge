- An economic policy intended to change total expenditure. This may be through fiscal policy, for example a tax cut, or through monetary policy, via a reduction in interest rates. It is contrasted with an expenditure switching policy, intended to divert expenditure from one outlet to another, for example the use of tariffs or import quotas to switch spending from imported on to home-produced goods.
