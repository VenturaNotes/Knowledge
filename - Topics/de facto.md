- (Latin: in fact) Denoting that something exists as a matter of fact rather than by right. For example, a plaintiff may have de facto control of a property. This compares to de jure (Latin: in law), which denotes that something exists as a matter of legal right. For example, a planning authority may have acted de jure in refusing a planning application. In international law, one government may recognize another de facto, i.e. acknowledge that it is in control of the country even though it has no legal right to be. De jure recognition acknowledges that it has a legal right to govern. The basis of the distinction, however, is more political than legal.
