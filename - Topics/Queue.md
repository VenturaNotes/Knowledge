- (1) (FIFO list, pushup stack, pushup list) A linear list where all insertions are made at one end of the list and all removals and accesses at the other. Like a pushdown stack, a queue can be implemented in hardware as a specialized form of addressless memory, and is most commonly used for speed buffering between a real-time data input/output stream and a form of memory that requires start/stop time.

- A number of customers for a good or service waiting to be served. Queue discipline describes the order in which customers are served: this may be first-come first-served, random order, or last-in first-out, or some system of priorities may be used. Queuing models analyse the behaviour of queues, often using numerical simulation, and explore efficient ways of handling queues.
