- A pair of endocrine glands situated immediately above the kidneys (hence they are also known as the suprarenal glands). The inner portion of the adrenals, the medulla, contains chromaffin tissue and secretes the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline; the outer cortex secretes small amounts of sex hormones (androgens and oestrogens) and various corticosteroids, which have a wide range of effects on the body. See also ACTH.
