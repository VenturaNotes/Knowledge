- A pair of endocrine glands situated immediately above the kidneys (hence they are also known as the suprarenal glands). The inner portion of the adrenals, the medulla, contains chromaffin tissue and secretes the hormones adrenaline and noradrenaline; the outer cortex secretes small amounts of sex hormones (androgens and oestrogens) and various corticosteroids, which have a wide range of effects on the body. See also ACTH.
## Source[^2]
- (suprarenal glands) two triangular endocrine glands, each of which covers the superior surface of a kidney. Each gland has two parts, the medulla and cortex. The medulla forms the grey core of the gland; it consists mainly of chromaffin tissue and is stimulated by the sympathetic nervous system to produce adrenaline and noradrenaline. The cortex is a yellowish tissue surrounding the medulla. It is derived embryologically from mesoderm and is stimulated by pituitary hormones (principally ACTH) to produce three kinds of corticosteroid hormones, which affect carbohydrate metabolism (e.g. cortisol), electrolyte metabolism (e.g. aldosterone), and the sex glands (oestrogens and androgens).
