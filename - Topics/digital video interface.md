- A specification for providing a high speed digital connection for visual displays. It aims to provide a common interface for all display devices used by the PC industry. DVI provides high speed digital signals supporting up to 350 Mpixels/sec as well as conventional analogue signals (SVGA etc.) in a single connector. Plug-and-play through hot plug detection is supported. DVI is increasingly being used with LCD displays that are purely digital in operation and there is no need for intermediate analogue signals. This simplifies the circuitry and removes many of the synchronizing and aliasing problems encountered with analogue-to-digital conversion.
