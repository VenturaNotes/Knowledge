- $n$. A key finding in support of dual-process models of reasoning, produced by creating a conflict between logical reasoning and prior beliefs. For example, in the following invalid syllogism, the conclusion conflicts with prior beliefs, and only about 10 per cent of undergraduate students accept it as valid: No millionaires are hard workers; Some rich people are hard workers; Therefore, some millionaires are not rich people. In contrast, when the same argument is couched in the following terms, in which the conclusion conforms to prior beliefs, more than 70 per cent accept it as valid: No addictive things are inexpensive; Some cigarettes are inexpensive; Therefore, some addictive things are not cigarettes. This shows that people tend to be influenced by both the logic of arguments and the believability of their conclusions. The term was introduced in 1980 in an article in the journal Memory and Cognition by the US psychologist Russell Revlin (born 1943) and others. Compare ATMOSPHERE HYPOTHESIS.
