- A scale of measurement where differences in value are meaningful but not ratios of the values. Consequently the choice of zero on the scale is arbitrary. For example, temperature is an interval scale. On the Celsius scale it is not meaningful to say that $10\degree$ is twice as hot as $5 \degree$
