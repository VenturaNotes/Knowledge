- $n$. an element essential to life. The body of an adult contains on average 4g of iron, over half of which is contained in haemoglobin in the red blood cells, the rest being distributed between myoglobin in muscles, cytochromes and iron stores in the form of ferritin and haemosiderin. Iron is an essential component in the transfer of oxygen in the body, as well as a component of enzymes involved in the immune function. The absorption and loss of iron is very finely controlled. A good dietary source is meat, particularly liver. The RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is 10 mg per day for men and 12 mg per day for women during their reproductive life. A deficiency of iron may lead to anaemia. Symbol: Fe.
- Many preparations of iron are used to treat iron-deficiency anaemia. These include preparations taken by mouth, such as ferrous sulphate, and those administered by injection, such as iron dextran.
