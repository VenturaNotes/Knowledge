- (HHS) a state of extreme hyperglycaemia seen in type 2 diabetes accompanied by dehydration that can be severe, typically triggered by illness in a patient with type 2 diabetes or a patient with previously unknown type 2 diabetes. It was previously known as hyperosmolar non-ketotic hyperglycaemia (HONK). Emergency hospital treatment is required to control blood glucose levels and to treat the dehydration and the underlying precipitating cause. There is a significant mortality, especially in the elderly and patients with other disorders (e.g. vascular disease). While insulin is required as part of the initial emergency treatment, the patient often does not need insulin in the longer term, when well.
