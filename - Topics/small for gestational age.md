- (SGA) describing a fetus or baby that has failed to reach the size or birth weight expected for its gestational age. This may be because the fetus or baby is constitutionally small or it may be due to intrauterine growth restriction in the fetus. In the latter case, the perinatal outcome is less favorable.
