## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a product of protein metabolism found in muscle. Its phosphate, creatine phosphate (phosphocreatine, phosphagen), acts as a store of high-energy phosphate in muscle and serves to maintain adequate amounts of ATP (the source of energy for muscular contraction).
## Source[^2]
- A compound, synthesized from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine, that occurs in muscle. In the form of creatine phosphate (or phosphocreatine), it is an important short-term reserve of energy for muscle contraction. This energy is released when creatine phosphate transfers its phosphate to ADP to replenish supplies of ATP, and is itself converted to creatinine, which is excreted in the urine (at a rate of $1.2\textendash1.5 \mathrm{~g} /$ day in humans). See also PHOSPHAGEN.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A product of protein metabolism produced by the liver and kidneys and found in striped muscle, where it helps to replenish energy and reduce muscle fatigue. It is sometimes taken by athletes and sports competitors as a performance enhancer, and is liable to cause liver and kidney damage if taken in excess, but it is difficult to legislate against because it is a naturally occurring amino acid and is also found in dietary meat. See creatine phosphate. \[From Greek kreas, kreatos flesh + -ine indicating an organic compound]
