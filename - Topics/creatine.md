## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. a product of protein metabolism found in muscle. Its phosphate, creatine phosphate (phosphocreatine, phosphagen), acts as a store of high-energy phosphate in muscle and serves to maintain adequate amounts of ATP (the source of energy for muscular contraction).
## Source[^2]
- A compound, synthesized from the amino acids arginine, glycine, and methionine, that occurs in muscle. In the form of creatine phosphate (or phosphocreatine), it is an important short-term reserve of energy for muscle contraction. This energy is released when creatine phosphate transfers its phosphate to ADP to replenish supplies of ATP, and is itself converted to creatinine, which is excreted in the urine (at a rate of $1.2\textendash1.5 \mathrm{~g} /$ day in humans). See also PHOSPHAGEN.
