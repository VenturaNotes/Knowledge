- A defect is anything outside the given specifications of a product or service. This could be an app that’s not fit for purpose or a crack in a piece of equipment. It could also be a product that's not delivered in the promised timeframe. Defects per unit (DPU) is a metric used to define how often these defects occur. It calculates the number of defective product or service units an organization produces. For instance, if a business produces 100 e-books, of which 10 have typos, the DPU is 0.1 (10/100). DPU is normally expressed as a decimal.
