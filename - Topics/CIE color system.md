- $n$. An internationally accepted system put forward in 1931 by the Commission Internationale de l'Ã‰clairage (the French International Lighting Commission) for specifying any spectral color precisely in terms of the proportions (tristimulus values) of three additive primary colors $x, y$, and $z$ required by a standard observer to match it. Also called the XYZ system . The CIE color diagram (see illustration) shows the color that results from mixing any pair of spectral colors with each other or with purple or white.

	- Parts
		- Blue, Violet, Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow, Green
	- The spectral locus (curve) is shown, together with purple and white. To predict the appearance of a mixture of two colors, draw a straight line connecting them and locate the point on the line corresponding to the proportion of each. Thus an equal mixture of green at 550 nm with red at 630 nm is equidistant between these two points, matching yellow at 580 nm ; and an equal mixture of blue-green at 505 nm with green at 550 nm yields a point in the interior matching a mixture of three parts green at 520 nm with one part white.
