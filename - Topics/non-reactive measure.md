- $n$. Any measure of behavior that is not influenced by awareness on the part of the participants or subjects that their behavior is being observed or measured. In general, unobtrusive measures are considered non-reactive, and some other techniques, such as randomized response, are also intended to be non-reactive. See also REACTIVITY.
