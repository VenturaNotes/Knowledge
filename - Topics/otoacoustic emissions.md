- (OAE, Kemp echoes) tiny sounds that emerge from the inner ear either spontaneously (spontaneous otoacoustic emissions, SOAE) or shortly after the ear is exposed to an external sound (evoked otoacoustic emissions, EOAE). An objective test of hearing has been developed using otoacoustic emissions. The test equipment creates a small sound and then detects any response from the ear. This can be done using a click stimulus (transient otoacoustic emissions, TOAE) or two separate tones (distortion product otoacoustic emissions, DPOAE). A normal response suggests that the ear is functioning and that hearing is satisfactory. All newborn children in the UK are now screened using this technique.
