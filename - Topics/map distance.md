- $n$. A measure of the relative distance or separation of two gene loci in terms of the percentage of progeny inheriting one but not the other. It ranges from zero to 100, thus 10 map units represents ten per cent discordant progeny, 15 map units represents fifteen per cent discordant progeny, and so on.
