- In econometrics, model $A$ is said to be nested in model $B$ if it can be obtained from $B$ by imposing a set of restrictions on the parameters of $B$. For example, model A1: $y=\alpha+\beta x+\varepsilon$ is nested in model B: $y=\alpha+\beta x+\gamma z+\varepsilon$, but model A2: $y=\alpha+\beta x+\delta w+\varepsilon$ is not. In this example, A1 can be obtained from B by imposing restriction $\gamma=0$; A2 cannot be obtained from B as each contains a variable that is not in the other one.
