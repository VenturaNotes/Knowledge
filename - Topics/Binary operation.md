## Synthesis
- This is when you combine two elements to produce another element
	- #question Does it need to be addition or subtraction or can it be any kind of element that you need?
- A binary operation combines two elements from a set to produce a single result, often an arithmetic one like addition $(a+b)$, multiplication $(a \times b)$, or even finding the maximum/minimum $(\text{max}(a,b))$ of two numbers, where the result stays within the same set. For example, adding two integers yields another integer.

- Dyadic operation is also known as binary operation
- Binary operation defined on a set S. A function from the domain $S \times S$ into S itself. Many of the everyday arithmetic and algebraic operations are dyadic, e.g. the addition of two integers, the union of two sets, and the conjunction of two Boolean expressions. Although basically functions, dyadic operations are usually represented using an infix notation, as in
$$3 + 4, U \cup V, P \land Q$$
- A symbol, such as $\circ$, can be used to represent a generalized dyadic operation
- When the set is finite, Cayley tables and sometimes truth tables are used to define the meaning of the operation

binary operation 1. (dyadic operation) defined on a set $S$. A function from the domain $S \times S$ into $S$ itself. Many of the everyday arithmetic and algebraic operations are binary, including the addition of two integers, the union of two sets, and the conjunction of two Boolean expressions.

  

Although basically functions, binary operations are usually represented using an infix notation, as in

  

$$

3+4, \quad U \cup V, \quad P \wedge Q

$$

  

The operation symbol then appears between the left and right operand. A symbol, such as ${ }^{\circ}$, can be used to represent a generalized binary operation.

  

When the set $S$ is finite, Cayley tables and sometimes truth tables are used to define the meaning of the operation. 2. An operation on binary operands.
## Source[^4]
- A binary operation $\circ$ on a set $S$ is a rule that associates with any elements $a$ and $b$ of $S$ an element denoted by $a \circ b$. This is equivalent to saying that $S$ is closed under $\circ$. Common examples include addition, multiplication, and composition (on certain sets). See ASSOCIATIVE, COMMUTATIVE, OPERATION.
