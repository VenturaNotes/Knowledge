## Synthesis
- Information from an engineering perspective is data that resolves uncertainty about a circumstance. The more uncertainty resolved by the data, the more information the data has conveyed.

- Generally, information is whatever is capable of causing a human mind to change its opinion about the current state of the real world. Formally, and especially in science and engineering, information is whatever contributes to a reduction in the uncertainty of the state of a system; in this case, uncertainty is usually expressed in an objectively measurable form. Commonly, this is done by means of Shannon's entropy. Nevertheless, this formula for uncertainty involves probabilities, and these may well have to be subjective. If that is so, the formal measurement must be qualified as depending on subjective probabilities, and 'uncertainty' must be replaced by 'opinion, or personal estimate, of uncertainty'.
- Information must be distinguished from any medium that is capable of carrying it. A physical medium (such as a magnetic disk) may carry a logical medium (data, such as binary or text symbols). The information content of any physical objects, or logical data, cannot be measured or discussed until it is known what range of possibilities existed before and after they were received. The information lies in the reduction in uncertainty resulting from the receipt of the objects or the data, and not in the size or complexity of the objects or data themselves. Questions of the form, function, and semantic import of data are only relevant to information inasmuch as they contribute to the reduction of uncertainty. If an identical memorandum is received twice, it does not convey twice the information that its first occurrence conveyed: the second occurrence conveys no information at all, unless, by prior agreement, the number of occurrences is itself to be regarded as significant.
- Information has ramifications in security, politics, culture, and the economy, as well as in science and engineering. The extent to which information is used as an economic commodity is one of the defining characteristics of the 'post-industrial' society, hence the phrase 'the information society'.

- Data communicated or received that resolves uncertainty about a particular fact or circumstance. 
	- When we receive the data, we'll know more about a particular circumstance
	- The greater the uncertainty resolved by the data, the more information the data has conveyed

- (1) The data available to individuals, firms, or governments at the time economic decisions have to be taken. Information in this sense refers to economic data and the collection, use, and interpretation of those data.
- (2) The knowledge possessed by economic agents. An economy is described by the preferences and endowments of its consumers, the technology of its firms, and the prices and characteristics of its products. Consumers, firms, and governments take actions. What matters for the attainment of economic efficiency is who knows which parts of the total description of the economy. The economy has symmetric information if all agents are equally informed or equally uninformed about relevant facts. What information is relevant changes with the economic environment. In a competitive economy a consumer only needs to know their own preferences, product characteristics, and prices in order to trade. Information about the preferences of other consumers or about firms is irrelevant. The competitive equilibrium will be Pareto efficient if information is symmetric. There is asymmetric information when some agents possess more of the relevant information than others. For example, a consumer selling a second-hand car may have better knowledge of its qualities than a potential purchaser. Asymmetric information is a cause of market failure. Contract theory has found it useful to distinguish between public information and private information. Public information is observable and verifiable, so can be a determinant of the pay-off in an incentive contract. Private information cannot be observed but only inferred from actions. An incentive contract cannot be conditioned on private information. In game theory the distinction is made between games with complete information$\textemdash$all participants know the entire structure of the game$\textemdash$and games with incomplete information$\textemdash$not all information about the game is known.
