- An investor who is an active participant in a business, as well as providing capital. Such participation may vary between appointing some members of the board of directors and informal consultation on a continuing basis. It involves a long-term connection between the investor and the company; a relationship investor is not in the business of selling out to make short-term speculative gains.
