## Synthesis
- A coenzyme, like [[Coenzyme A]], is considered a type of "helper molecule" that acts as a cofactor to an [[enzyme]].
## Source[^1]
- $n$. a nonprotein organic compound that, in the presence of an enzyme, plays an essential role in the reaction that is catalyzed by the enzyme. Coenzymes, which frequently contain the B vitamins in their molecular structure, include coenzyme A, FAD, and NAD.
## Source[^2]
- An organic nonprotein molecule that associates with an enzyme molecule in catalysing biochemical reactions. Coenzymes usually participate in the substrate-enzyme interaction by donating or accepting certain chemical groups. Many vitamins are precursors of coenzymes. See also COFACTOR.
