- A managed services provider (MSP) handles outsourced IT services for other businesses that lack the time, budget, or capacity for in-house IT services. MSP offerings can cover areas such as networks, applications, infrastructure, and security. Once engaged, MSP responsibilities can include strategic planning, installations, maintenance, and technical support. Some MSPs specialize in a particular vendor or technology (e.g., Amazon Web Services, data storage) while others focus on industries (e.g., legal, healthcare). MSPs typically monitor and administer their clientsâ€™ IT systems remotely, and make on-site visits as needed.
