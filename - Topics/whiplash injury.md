- a soft-tissue injury of the neck resulting from a sudden jerking back (hyperextension) of the head and neck, usually following a rear-end motor vehicle collision. It is associated with muscle, tendon, and ligament tears and inflammation in the front of the neck, which causes pain and stiffness. The possibility of fractures and other serious spinal injuries should be excluded by X-ray or MRI. Treatment includes analgesics, NSAIDs, a soft surgical collar, and physiotherapy. Symptoms occasionally last for many months or years.
