- If $p$ is the perimeter of a closed curve in a plane and the area enclosed by the curve is A, then $p^2 \le 4\pi A$, and equality is only achieved if the curve is a circle. Turning around this condition, it says that for a fixed length of curve p, the greatest area which can be enclosed is when the curve is a circle. The result can be generalized to surfaces in 3-dimensional space where the sphere is the most efficient shape at enclosing volume for a fixed surface area, and to higher dimensions.
