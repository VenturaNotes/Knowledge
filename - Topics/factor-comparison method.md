## Source [^1]
- A method of job evaluation in which jobs are compared with each other in terms of compensable job factors. These may include skill, effort, decision making, working conditions, and responsibility for people, finance, or equipment. Ideally, all factors should be present in all the jobs being evaluated to some degree, so that each job can be scored under each factor heading. The total scores across factors can then determine the sorting of jobs into a set of pay grades, usually by comparison with a number of benchmark jobs. Compare CLASSIFICATION METHOD; HAY METHOD; JOB-COMPONENT METHOD; POINT METHOD; RANKING METHOD.
