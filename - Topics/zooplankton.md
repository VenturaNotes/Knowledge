- The animal component of plankton. All major animal phyla are represented in zooplankton, as adults, larvae, or eggs; some are just visible to the naked eye but most cannot be seen without magnification. Examples include copepods, shrimps, krill, other small crustaceans, jellyfish, and tunicates. Near the surface of the sea there may be many thousands of such animals per cubic metre.
