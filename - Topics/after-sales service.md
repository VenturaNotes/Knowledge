- The provision of services after goods have been sold which make them more useful to customers. This can include advice on and training in the use of the product; routine maintenance, servicing, and repairs in the event of breakdown; provision of materials and spare parts; replacement under warranty in the event of failure of the goods supplied; and updating if the product is developed further. Customersâ€™ expectations of cheap and efficient after-sales service are of great importance in making products competitive, and lack of customer confidence in the quality and price of after-sales services may make products unsaleable. See also COMPETITIVENESS.

- Maintenance of products by the manufacturers or their agents after purchase. This often takes the form of a guarantee (see WARRANTY), which is effective for a stated period during which the service is free in respect of both parts and labour, followed by a maintenance contract for which the buyer of the product has to pay. Efficient and effective after-sales service is an essential component of good marketing policy, especially for such consumer durables as cars and computers; in the case of exported goods it is of overriding importance.
