- A theorem determining the effect of a differential change in a parameter on the outcome of a maximization problem.
- Formally, consider the problem of choosing $x$ to maximize a function $f(x$; a), where $a$ is a parameter. Denote the solution to this maximization by $x(a)$ and define the maximum value function $V(a)$ by
	- #question What does ; mean in this case?
$$V(a)=m a x_{\{x\}} f(x ; a)=f(x(a) ; a).$$
- The envelope theorem states that$$\left.\frac{d V(a)}{d a}=\frac{\partial f(x(a) ; a)}{\partial a}\right|_{x=x(a)}$$so that the derivative of the value function is the partial derivative of the objective evaluated at the solution to the optimization.
