- A rewriting of Lagrange's equations which foreshadowed advances in statistical mechanics and quantum theory. In the notation of Lagrange's equations, we set $p_i = \partial L / \partial \overset \cdot q_i$ and introduce the Hamiltonian $$H(q,p,t) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}p_iq_i - L(q,p,t).$$Hamilton's equations then have the form $$\frac{dq_i}{dt} = \frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i}, \quad \frac{dp_i}{dt} = -\frac{\partial H}{\partial q_i}.$$
