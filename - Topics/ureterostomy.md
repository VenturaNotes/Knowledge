- $n$. the surgical creation of an external opening from the ureter. This usually involves bringing the ureter to the skin surface through the abdominal wall so that the urine can drain into a suitable appliance (cutaneous ureterostomy). The divided dilated ureter can be brought through the skin to form a spout, but ureters of a normal size need to be implanted into a segment of bowel used for this purpose (see ILEAL CONDUIT) to avoid narrowing and obstruction.
