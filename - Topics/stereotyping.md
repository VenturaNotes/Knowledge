- Making assumptions about individuals (which may or may not be correct) on the basis of the groups to which they belong or are held to belong. Such assumptions may be based on age, class, gender, ethnic origin, nationality, religion, or sexuality. Unfortunately, human beings are liable to have selective prejudices towards their fellows, seeing only what they want to see and ignoring factors that do not fit in with their preconceived beliefs.
- They also tend to assume that all members of a group have the same, or similar, characteristics. Thus:
	- all graduates are clever
	- all unemployed people are lazy
- are two of the stereotypes that have to be resisted in carrying out job selection interviews. See also HORNS AND HALO EFFECT.
