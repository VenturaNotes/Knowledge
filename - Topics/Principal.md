- (1) A person or firm employing another to act as their agent. A person using an estate agent to sell a house, for example, is a principal; the estate agent is the agent. The principal-agent problem is concerned with how agents can be induced to act in the interests of the principal rather than their own.
- (2) The amount of money borrowed at the start of a loan. The borrower is obligated to pay interest on the loan and eventually to repay the principal.
