## Source [^1]
- A preprinted paper slip used to pay cash or cheques into a specified bank account (often the customer's own). It is commonly found at the back of cheque books and at the bottom of utility and credit card bills. A completed BGC is not itself a payment instrument; it has no value apart from the cash or cheques that accompany it. See CREDIT TRANSFER; GIRO.
