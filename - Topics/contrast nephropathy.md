- deterioration in renal function (of more than 25\%) after administration of radiocontrast material. Development of this condition is more likely when there is pre-existing renal disease (the most important factor) or diabetes, vasoconstriction, simultaneous use of NSAIDs, and large amounts of radiocontrast are used. It is thought that the radiocontrast induces vasoconstriction in the vessels supplying the medulla of the kidney and aggravates hypoxia in this part of the kidney.
