- $n$. damage to the tissues caused by freezing. The affected parts, usually the nose, fingers, or toes, become pale and numb. Ice crystals form in the tissues, which may thus be destroyed, and amputation may become necessary. Frostbitten parts should not be rubbed, since there is no blood circulation in the tissues, but they may be gently warmed in tepid water. Precautions must be taken against bacterial infection, to which frostbitten skin is highly susceptible.
