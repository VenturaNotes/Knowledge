- $n$. In psychophysics, a law relating either the absolute threshold or the difference threshold for visual brightness sensation to the intensity of the stimulus and the area of the retina that is stimulated, usually expressed as $\sqrt{A} \times I=k$, where $A$ is the area of the retina stimulated, $I$ is the intensity of the stimulus, and $k$ is a constant. It is valid for stimuli subtending visual angles from about 6 minutes of arc ($1 / 10$ of a degree) to about 20 degrees. Compare Ricco's law. \[Named after the German physiologist Hans Edmund Piper (1877-1915) who formulated it]
