- A term used to describe a class of digital device that can accept parallel $n$-bit data words and convert them into serial sequential $n$-bit data streams. These devices often consist of an $n$-bit shift register that is parallel loaded with the data word (see diagram). This data is then clocked out of the register in serial form. Compare SERIAL IN PARALLEL OUT.
