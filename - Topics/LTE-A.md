- LTE-A is a mobile communication standard, also known as Long-Term Evolution Advanced. It is an improvement on the LTE standard, increasing speed, reliability, and fixing bugs. Like other forms of these telecommunication standards, LTE-A is backward compatible. Phones and other devices which work on LTE-A will also work on slower networks like LTE or 3G.
