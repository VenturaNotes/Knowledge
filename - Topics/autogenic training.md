- $n$. A form of psychotherapy in which the client is taught self-hypnosis and biofeedback as techniques of managing stress. It involves a sequence of graded mental exercises (concentrating in turn on feelings of heaviness in the limbs, a sense of warmth in the limbs, heart rate, breathing, warmth of the upper abdomen, and coolness of the forehead) designed to promote physical relaxation. It was developed in Germany from the 1930s to the 1950s and popularized by the German psychiatrist and neurologist Johann Heinrich Schultz (1884-1970). Also called autogenics. \[From German das autogene Training, from Greek autogenes self-generated, from autos self + genein to produce]
