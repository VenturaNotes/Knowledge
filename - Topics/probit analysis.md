- A statistical technique used to relate the proportion of subjects responding to the strength of an applied stimulus. The stimulus is often applied in a series of increasing amounts in geometrical progression, and the proportion responding is modelled by the cumulative normal frequency distribution (see PROBABILITY DISTRIBUTIONS). The method estimates the median effective stimulus or LD50 and the slope of the response. It is widely used in pharmacology, biology, and in testing the safety of products.
