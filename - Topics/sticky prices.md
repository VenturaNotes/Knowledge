- Sticky prices are prices that don't change quickly in response to economic conditions, supply and demand, or costs.
- This is in contrast to [[flexible prices]], which change quickly in response to economic conditions
## Source[^2]
- Prices which do not vary in the face of small changes in costs or demand conditions. Sticky prices can be rationalized by administrative costs in changing prices, and through uncertainty about which way costs or demand conditions will move next. Firms may also believe that raising prices risks losing customers if competitors do not follow suit, while cutting prices runs the risk of starting a price war.
