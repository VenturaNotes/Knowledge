- (LIBOR) The rate of interest at which banks offer to lend to each other on the London interbank market. The loans are for a minimum of $Â£ 250,000$ for periods from overnight up to five years. LIBOR is the most significant interest rate for international banks. It is also used as a benchmark for lending to bank customers and as a reference rate for many derivatives. In 2012 evidence emerged of a major scandal in which leading banks had manipulated LIBOR for their own profit; as a result oversight of LIBOR was transferred from the British Bankers' Association to the Intercontinental Exchange group. See also London Inter Bank Bid Rate.

- (LIBOR) The rate of interest on short-term wholesale loans in the London money market: this is the rate at which banks are willing to lend to each other. LIBOR is used as a benchmark for variable-rate loans within the UK and internationally. LIBOR is formed as the average of the interest rates that leading London banks report they would expect to be charged to borrow from other banks. The fact that it is based on reports has led to incidents of deliberate manipulation of the rate by collusion in false reporting.
