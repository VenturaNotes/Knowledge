- (LIBOR) The rate of interest at which banks offer to lend to each other on the London interbank market. The loans are for a minimum of $Â£ 250,000$ for periods from overnight up to five years. LIBOR is the most significant interest rate for international banks. It is also used as a benchmark for lending to bank customers and as a reference rate for many derivatives. In 2012 evidence emerged of a major scandal in which leading banks had manipulated LIBOR for their own profit; as a result oversight of LIBOR was transferred from the British Bankers' Association to the Intercontinental Exchange group. See also London Inter Bank Bid Rate.
