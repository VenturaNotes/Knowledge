- $n$. a poisonous alkaloid derived from tobacco, responsible for the dependence of regular smokers on cigarettes. In small doses nicotine has a stimulating effect on the autonomic nervous system, causing in regular smokers such effects as raised blood pressure and pulse rate and impaired appetite. Large doses cause paralysis of the autonomic ganglia. Nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine products formulated as chewing gum, skin patches, nasal sprays, etc.) is used as an aid to stop smoking.

- A colorless poisonous alkaloid present in tobacco. It exerts its effect by binding to a class of acetylcholine receptors and stimulates the release of dopamine by neurons in the brain, thus stimulating the reward system and leading to addiction. It can be used as an insecticide. See also NEONICOTINOID.

- $n$. A colorless, oily, toxic liquid that turns yellow on exposure to air and light and is the principal alkaloid in tobacco, being ingested when tobacco is smoked, chewed, or snuffed. It is a powerful central nervous system stimulant, mimicking acetylcholine at certain neuroreceptor sites in both sympathetic and parasympathetic divisions of the autonomic nervous system, triggering the release of dopamine and noradrenalin (norepinephrine) and stimulating the release of vasopressin. Prolonged tobacco use often leads to nicotine dependence (2) or addiction. See also CHOLINOMIMETIC, NICOTINE-RELATED DISORDERS, NICOTINIC RECEPTOR. \[French, from Latin herba nicotiana Nicot's plant, named after the 16th-century French diplomat Jaques Nicot (1530-1600) who supplied tobacco to Catherine de Medici and introduced it into France in 1560 + -ine indicating an organic compound]
