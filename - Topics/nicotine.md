- $n$. a poisonous alkaloid derived from tobacco, responsible for the dependence of regular smokers on cigarettes. In small doses nicotine has a stimulating effect on the autonomic nervous system, causing in regular smokers such effects as raised blood pressure and pulse rate and impaired appetite. Large doses cause paralysis of the autonomic ganglia. Nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine products formulated as chewing gum, skin patches, nasal sprays, etc.) is used as an aid to stop smoking.
