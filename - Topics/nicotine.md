- $n$. a poisonous alkaloid derived from tobacco, responsible for the dependence of regular smokers on cigarettes. In small doses nicotine has a stimulating effect on the autonomic nervous system, causing in regular smokers such effects as raised blood pressure and pulse rate and impaired appetite. Large doses cause paralysis of the autonomic ganglia. Nicotine replacement therapy (nicotine products formulated as chewing gum, skin patches, nasal sprays, etc.) is used as an aid to stop smoking.

- A colorless poisonous alkaloid present in tobacco. It exerts its effect by binding to a class of acetylcholine receptors and stimulates the release of dopamine by neurons in the brain, thus stimulating the reward system and leading to addiction. It can be used as an insecticide. See also NEONICOTINOID.
