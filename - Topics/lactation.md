- $n$. the secretion of milk by the mammary glands of the breasts, which begins normally at the end of pregnancy or may be pathological (see GALACTORRHOEA). A fluid called colostrum is secreted before the milk is produced; both secretions are released in response to the sucking action of the infant on the nipple. Lactation is controlled by hormones (see PROLACTIN; OXYTOCIN); it stops when the baby is no longer fed at the breast.

- The discharge of milk from the mammary glands. This generally only occurs after birth of the young and is stimulated by the sucking action of the infants and changes in oestradiol levels. Lactation is under the control of hormones, notably prolactin, which mediates milk production, and oxytocin, which induces release, or 'letdown', of milk during suckling of the young.
