- $n$. the secretion of milk by the mammary glands of the breasts, which begins normally at the end of pregnancy or may be pathological (see GALACTORRHOEA). A fluid called colostrum is secreted before the milk is produced; both secretions are released in response to the sucking action of the infant on the nipple. Lactation is controlled by hormones (see PROLACTIN; OXYTOCIN); it stops when the baby is no longer fed at the breast.
