- (Gaussian distribution) An important probability distribution for data in the form of continuous measurements. The frequency function is given by$$\left(2 \pi \sigma^{2}\right)^{-1 / 2} \exp \left[-1 / 2(x-\mu)^{2} / \sigma^{2}\right]$$The distribution is symmetric about the mean, $\mu$, and its variance is $\sigma^{2}$. The range of $x$ is infinite $(-\infty, \infty)$. Many sampling distributions tend to the normal form as the sample size tends to infinity.
