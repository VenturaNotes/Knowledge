- Change management is an automated process that manages the development and ongoing care of a variety of systems, including advanced business applications. Change management requires minimal human interaction; such programs are automated by computer processes that ensure stability and routine updates and maintenance. Change management is usually targeted toward specific systems within a greater whole. Automation allows change management to occur in areas that a business identifies as needing upgrades when certain criteria are met.
