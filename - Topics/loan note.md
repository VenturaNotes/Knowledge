- A form of loan stock (see DEBENTURE) in which an investor takes a note rather than cash as the result of a share offer to defer tax liability. The yield is often variable and may be linked to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate. Loan notes are not usually marketable but are usually repayable on demand.
