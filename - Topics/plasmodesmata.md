- (sing. plasmodesma) Fine cytoplasmic strands that connect the protoplasts of adjacent plant cells by passing through their cell walls. Plasmodesmata are cylindrical in shape (about 20-40 nm in diameter) and are lined by the plasma membrane of the two adjacent cells. The endoplasmic reticula of the two adjacent cells are connected by a narrower structure, the desmotubule, which runs through the centre of a plasmodesma. Plasmodesmata tend to occur in groups, forming distinct areas called primary pit fields (see PIT). They permit the passage between cells of substances including ions, sugars, amino acids, and macromolecules.
