- interrupt priority An allocated order of importance to program interrupts. Generally a system can only respond to one interrupt at a time but the rate of occurrence can be higher than the rate of servicing. The system control may arrange interrupt masks to suppress some types of interrupt if a more important interrupt has just occurred.
