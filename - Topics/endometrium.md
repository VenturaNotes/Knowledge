- $n$. the mucous membrane lining the uterus, which is covered with columnar epithelium. It becomes progressively thicker and more glandular and has an increased blood supply in the latter part of the menstrual cycle. This prepares the endometrium for implantation of the embryo, but if this does not occur much of the endometrium breaks down and is lost in menstruation. If pregnancy is established the endometrium becomes the decidua, which is shed after birth. -endometrial adj.
