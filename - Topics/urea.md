## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. the main breakdown product of protein metabolism. It is the chemical form in which unrequired nitrogen is excreted by the body in the urine. Urea is formed in the liver from ammonia and carbon dioxide in a series of enzyme-mediated reactions (the urea cycle). Accumulation of urea in the bloodstream together with other nitrogenous compounds is due to kidney failure and gives rise to uraemia.
## Source[^2]
- (carbamide) A white crystalline water-soluble solid, $\mathrm{CO}\left(\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)_{2}$. Urea is the major end product of nitrogen excretion in mammals and other ureotelic animals, being synthesized by the urea cycle. Urea is synthesized industrially from ammonia and carbon dioxide for use in urea-formaldehyde resins and pharmaceuticals, as a source of nonprotein nitrogen for ruminant livestock, and as a nitrogen fertilizer.
