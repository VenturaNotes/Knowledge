- A computing appliance is a computer that provides one or more services. This machine has an operating software (OS) hidden beneath its interface, and it also embeds an application within the device. By hiding this software, a computing appliance is relatively easy to install and maintain. A computing appliance uses something called a general-purpose OS, which usually means software such as Windows or Linux. As a result, users can't load random services onto it. In other words, computing appliances are not flexible in the services they provide. Storage and firewall appliances are two examples of computing appliances.
