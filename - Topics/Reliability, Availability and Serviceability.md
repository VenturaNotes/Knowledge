- Reliability, availability, and serviceability (RAS) refer to a product's dependability, availability of optional features, and ease of repair and diagnosis. Product manufacturers and users must consider these three qualities when making, purchasing, or using a product and its components. RAS is important because its three attributes determine whether a product is of high quality, offers optional features, and can be repaired or diagnosed easily.
