- The study of those geometric properties which are invariant under affine transformations. So distance is not preserved, nor angle, but parallel lines and ellipses are. Points at infinity remain at infinity, and in fact affine geometry can be considered as projective geometry that preserves the line (or more generally the hyperplane) at infinity.
