- (three-state output) An electronic output stage consisting of a logic gate, commonly an inverter or buffer, that exhibits three possible logic states, namely logic 1, logic 0 , and an inactive (high-impedance or open-circuit) state. The inactive state allows the device outputs to be combined with other similar outputs in a busing structure such that only one device is active on the bus at any one time.
