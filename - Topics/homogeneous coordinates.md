- A coordinate system that algebraically treats all points in the projective plane (both Euclidean and ideal) equally. For example, the standard homogeneous coordinates $\left[p_{1}, p_{2}, p_{3}\right]$ of a point $P$ in the projective plane are of the form $[x, y, 1]$ if P is a point in the Euclidean plane $z=1$ whose Cartesian coordinates are $(x, y, 1)$, or are of the form $[a, b, 0]$ if P is the ideal point$\textemdash$the point at infinity$\textemdash$associated to all lines in the Euclidean plane $z=1$ with direction numbers $a, b, 0$. Homogeneous coordinates are so called because they treat Euclidean and ideal points in the same way.
- Homogeneous coordinates are widely used in computer graphics because they enable affine and projective transformations to be described as matrix manipulations in a coherent way.
