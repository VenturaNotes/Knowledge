- The prediction made in 1965 by Gordon Moore, cofounder of Intel, that in the future the number of transistors on a chip would double every two years. Surprisingly, Moore's prediction$\textemdash$based on the development of the then very new concept of the integrated circuit$\textemdash$still holds true in 2014. The Intel 4004 processor released in 1971 had 2300 transistors, whereas the most recent Intel 15-core Xeon processor has 4.3 billion. Over that period transistor sizes have shrunk from 10 micrometers to 22 nanometers.
