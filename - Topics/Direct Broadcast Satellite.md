- A direct broadcast satellite (DBS) is a type of geostationary satellite that can be used to transmit radio and TV programs. It is similar to a fixed-service satellite (FSS), but it offers higher power output, requiring smaller antennas to receive the signal. DBS services typically offer digital programming, digital audio services, and, increasingly, high-definition TV (HDTV).
