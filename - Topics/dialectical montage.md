- $n$. A term introduced by the Russian film-maker and editing theorist Lev Kuleshov (1899-1970) for a type of context effect that enables an actor in a film or motion picture in certain circumstances to convey emotion without expressing it. In 1922 Kuleshov carried out an experiment in which the famous Russian actor Ivan Mozhukhin (1889-1939) posed with a neutral facial expression for several seconds, and a close-up shot of his face was intercut with shots of a bowl of soup, a woman in a coffin, and a child playing with a toy. Viewers of the resulting montage thought they could see faint expressions of satisfaction, sadness, and happiness on Mozhukin's face as he appeared to respond to each of the cutaway vignettes in turn. \[From Greek dialektikos pertaining to argument, from dia between + legein to speak + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling + French montage an assemblage or superimposition of images, from monter to mount]
