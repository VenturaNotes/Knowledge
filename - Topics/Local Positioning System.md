- A local positioning system (LPS) is used to determine where exactly someone or something is in an indoor space. An LPS is typically installed at a very specific location, such as a warehouse or factory. These systems use technology such as Wi-Fi, signal equipment, cell controllers, electronic tags, and antennae to identify the location. They stop working once the item being tracked leaves the location.
