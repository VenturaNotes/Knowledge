- $n$. the middle of the three layers forming the wall of the heart (see also ENDOCARDIUM; EPICARDIUM). It is composed of cardiac muscle and forms the greater part of the heart wall, being thicker in the ventricles than in the atria. $\textemdash$myocardial adj.
## Source[^2]
- (pl. myocardia) The muscular wall of the heart. The thickness of the myocardium varies, reflecting the magnitude of the pressure generated in the heart during contraction: the myocardium is thickest around the left ventricle, which does most of the work in the heart. The inner surface of the myocardium is lined by a layer of endothelium (the endocardium), which is continuous with the endothelium lining the blood vessels.
