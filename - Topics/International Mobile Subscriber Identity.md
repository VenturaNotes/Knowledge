- An international mobile subscriber identity (IMSI) is a unique number of up to 15 digits allocated to each GSM connection, which is a digital mobile network used by mobile phones. An IMSI contains:
	- The country code for the location of the GSM connection
	- The operator code associated with the network managing the connection
	- The mobile device number assigned to the connection
- The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) standardizes IMSIs.
