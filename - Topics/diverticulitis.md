- $n$. inflammation of a diverticulum, most commonly of one or more colonic diverticula. Faecal stasis or obstruction in a colonic diverticulum predisposes to bacterial infection and ischaemia, precipitating acute inflammation. Clinical symptoms include abdominal pain and fever with or without a change in bowel habit. Blood tests reveal leucocytosis. A minority of patients may develop complications, including abscess formation, rectal bleeding, fistulae, strictures, and peritonitis. Surgery is often required in complicated diverticulitis. Compare DIVERTICULAR DISEASE.
