- $n$. A preconceived opinion or judgement, formed without adequate consideration of relevant evidence, especially an unfavorable judgement based on group membership, including racialism, ethnocentrism, sexism, or ageism. The US psychologist Gordon W(illard) Allport (1897-1967) defined it in his seminal book The Nature of Prejudice (1954) as 'a feeling, favorable or unfavorable, toward a person or thing, prior to, or not based on, actual experience' (p. 7), but he also suggested a rougher definition that is more often quoted: 'being down on what you're not up on' (p. 8). See also ableism, authoritarianism, CONFIRMATION BIAS, CONTACT HYPOTHESIS, FATTISM, HETEROSEXISM, JIGSAW CLASSROOM, ROBBERS CAVE EXPERIMENT, SOCIAL CATEGORIZATION, SOCIAL IDENTITY THEORY, SPECIESISM, STEREOTYPE, STIGMATIZE. prejudiced adj. Characterized by prejudice. prejudicial adj. Tending to cause prejudice. \[From Latin praeiudicium a previous judgement or precedent, from prae before + iudicium a trial or sentence, from iudex a judge]
