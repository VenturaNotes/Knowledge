- The regulation of the concentrations of acids and bases in blood and other body fluids so that the pH remains within a physiologically acceptable range (see PH SCALE). This is achieved by the presence of natural buffer systems, such as the haemoglobin, hydrogencarbonate ions, and carbonic acid in mammalian blood. By acting in conjunction, these effectively mop up excess acids and bases and therefore prevent any large shifts in blood pH . The hydrogencarbonate buffer system is regulated by the kidneys, in which there is net excretion of hydrogen ions, while hydrogencarbonate ions are conserved, and by the lungs, which control the level of carbon dioxide in the blood.
## Source[^2]
- the balance between the amount of carbonic acid and bicarbonate in the blood, which must be maintained at a constant ratio of 1:20 in order to keep the hydrogen ion concentration of the plasma at a constant value (pH 7.4 ). Any alteration in this ratio will disturb the acidbase balance of the blood and tissues and cause either acidosis or alkalosis. The lungs and the kidneys play an important role in the regulation of the acid-base balance.
