- $n$. 
- (1) a state of alertness and of high responsiveness to stimuli. It is produced by strong motivation, by anxiety, and by a stimulating environment. 
- (2) physiological activation of the cerebral cortex by centers lower in the brain, such as the reticular activating system, resulting in wakefulness and alertness.
## Source[^2]
- A level of physiological and behavioral responsiveness in an animal, which tends to vary between sleep and full alertness. It is controlled in part by the reticular formation in the brainstem, which is crucial in controlling wakefulness and sleep. The level of arousal can be detected by changes in brain electrical activity, heart rate and muscle tone, responsiveness to new stimuli, and general activity.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Short for physiological arousal: excitation of the ascending reticular activating system, leading to a condition of alertness and readiness to respond, as evidenced by such physiological signs as increased heart rate and blood pressure, galvanic skin response (GSR), and desynchronized EEG activity.
