- The Weak Axiom of Revealed Preference. Assume that a consumer has strictly convex preferences so that the optimal choice is unique for every set of prices. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two different consumption bundles, and assume that a consumer chooses $X$ over $Y$ when both are affordable, that is, $X$ is directly revealed preferred to $Y$. WARP states that in this case $Y$ is never directly revealed preferred to $X$. If the revealed preference violates WARP, it is inconsistent with the consumer having preferences that can be described by a utility function. The Strong Axiom of Revealed Preference (SARP) extends this property to a chain of choices. Let $\left\{X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}\right\}$ be different consumption bundles, and let $X_{1}$ be directly revealed preferred to $X_{2}, X_{2}$ be directly revealed preferred to $X_{3}$, etc., and $X_{n-1}$ be directly revealed preferred to $X_{n}$; then $X_{1}$ is said to be (indirectly) revealed preferred to $X_{n}$. SARP states that when $X$ and $Y$ are different and $X$ is revealed preferred to $Y$, then $Y$ cannot be revealed preferred to $X$. The Generalized Axiom of Revealed Preference (GARP) further extends this property to the case when more than one consumption bundle maximizes utility for a given set of prices. Let $X$ and $Y$ be two different consumption bundles, and assume that a consumer chooses $X$ over $Y$ given the set of prices $\mathbf{p}$ when $\mathbf{p} X$ $>\mathbf{p} Y$; then $X$ is said to be strictly directly revealed preferred to $Y$. GARP states that when $X$ is directly or indirectly revealed preferred to $Y, Y$ cannot be strictly directly revealed preferred to $X$. GARP is never violated if an optimizing consumer has complete and transitive preferences.
