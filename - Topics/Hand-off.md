- Just as someone might hand off a message or a task, a cell or cell site can hand off a call to another cell. This hand-off is vital for cellphone users who travel with their devices. Without a proper hand-off, their call will end as soon as they move out of range of one cell. Successful hand-offs ensure continuous, uninterrupted calls. The connection to the original cell isnâ€™t cut off until a new connection is confirmed.
