- (chlorophenothane, dicophane) $n$. a powerful insecticide that was formerly widely used against lice, fleas, flies, bed bugs, cockroaches, and other disease-carrying and destructive insects. It is a relatively stable compound that is stored in animal fats, and the quantities now present in the environment - in the form of stores accumulated in animal tissues - have led to its use being restricted. Acute poisoning, from swallowing more than 20 g , produces nervous irritability, muscle twitching, convulsions, and coma, but only a few fatalities have been reported.
## Source[^2]
- Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane; a colorless organic crystalline compound, $\left(\mathrm{ClC}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{4}\right)_{2} \mathrm{CH}\left(\mathrm{CCl}_{3}\right)$, made by the reaction of trichloromethanal with chlorobenzene. DDT is the best known of a number of chlorine-containing pesticides used extensively in agriculture in the 1940s and 1950s. The compound is stable, accumulates in the soil, and concentrates in fatty tissue, reaching dangerous levels in carnivores high in the food chain. Restrictions are now placed on the use of DDT and similar pesticides; however, DDT is still used for control of malaria-carrying insects and leishmaniasis in some countries, particularly inside buildings.
