- (chlorophenothane, dicophane) $n$. a powerful insecticide that was formerly widely used against lice, fleas, flies, bed bugs, cockroaches, and other disease-carrying and destructive insects. It is a relatively stable compound that is stored in animal fats, and the quantities now present in the environment - in the form of stores accumulated in animal tissues - have led to its use being restricted. Acute poisoning, from swallowing more than 20 g , produces nervous irritability, muscle twitching, convulsions, and coma, but only a few fatalities have been reported.
