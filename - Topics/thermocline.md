- A steep temperature gradient that exists between the relatively warm surface layer and the much colder deep layer of a body of water such as a lake or ocean. In a lake the thermocline occurs in the middle zone (the metalimnion) and gives rise to thermally induced vertical stratification of the water. The metalimnion lies between the relatively warm epilimnion above and the cold hypolimnion below. The thermocline may be short-lived, especially in shallow lakes where wind action can mix the water from different levels. However, it can exist for most of the summer period in temperate lakes and sometimes nearly all year in tropical lakes. A thermocline can speed up the process of eutrophication by preventing the diffusion of oxygen from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion (see eutRopHC). The depth and temperature range of oceanic thermoclines vary with season and latitude, typically being deepest and strongest during the summer months and in tropical latitudes.
