- $n$. the muscle of the urinary bladder wall. The functioning of the detrusor and urethral sphincter is assessed by a urodynamic investigation (see URODYNAMICS). This is used to diagnose dysfunction, absent and exaggerated reflexes, and overactivity of the muscle (detrusor instability, overactive bladder syndrome). Neurogenic detrusor overactivity is due to neurological damage, as occurs in multiple sclerosis or in suprasacral spinal cord injury.
