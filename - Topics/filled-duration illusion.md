- $n$. A cognitive illusion that causes a specified period of time to be experienced as longer when many events are experienced during it than when it is relatively empty. For example, if two clicks mark the beginning and end of a period of silence (an unfilled interval), it tends to be perceived as shorter than the same objective interval filled with a sequence of clicks (a filled interval). Compare FILLED-SPACE ILLUSION.
