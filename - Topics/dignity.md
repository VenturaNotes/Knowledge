- $n$. (in clinical practice) a patient's sense that they are respected as an individual and that they are not being exposed unnecessarily or without their agreement to procedures they might find degrading. The preservation of dignity is important whenever people are undressed, asked very personal questions, seen by more than one clinician, discussed in a group in the third person, or involved in activities that are not essential (such as teaching). Clinical failures here may lead to lack of compliance with treatment (see ADHERENCE) or even complaint or depression (because of humiliation and loss of self-worth). Dignity is important when patients have lost abilities or have learning difficulties, and is vital in the care of any client group where help is needed with personal functions or when someone is dying. See also AUTONOMY.
