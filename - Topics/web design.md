- The process of developing the user interface of a website. Web design focuses on the visual aspects of the site as these appear to the user and, as such, might be defined as the subset of web development concerned with the aesthetics of the site's front-end. The target audience of the website will be placed at the forefront of all design decisions.
- Web design encompasses web page layout, content production, and graphic and animation design. Pages are generally created using HTML for the layout and CSS for the styles. A web designer may write the HTML and CSS codes or tags, or may use wysiwyg software. He or she may also use a content management system that provides templates for editing. The graphics and animations on a site are often created by the web designer, using some of the many tools that are now available.
