- (optic commissure) the X-shaped structure formed by the two optic nerves, which pass backwards from the eyeballs to meet in the midline beneath the brain, near the pituitary gland (see illustration). Nerve fibres from the nasal side of the retina of each eye cross over to join fibres from the lateral side of the retina of the opposite eye. The optic tracts resulting from the junction pass backwards to the occipital lobes.
## Source[^2]
- (optic chiasma) The point where some of the fibres from both optic nerves cross over to the opposite side, forming an X-shaped structure. Sensory information from the right side of both the right and left eye is transmitted to the right primary visual cortex in the brain (via the right lateral geniculate nucleus), while information from the left side of each eye is carried via the left lateral geniculate nucleus to the left primary visual cortex. Additional neurons project from the primary visual cortex to connect to centres elsewhere in the cortex responsible for higher-order visual processing and integration. Thus each half of the brain receives sensory information from both eyes.
