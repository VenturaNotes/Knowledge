- $n$. a malignant brain tumor (see CEREBRAL TUMOR) that occurs during childhood. It is derived from cells that have the apparent potential to mature into neurons and develops in the cerebellum, the part of the brain that is predominantly involved in the control of balance. The flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) may become obstructed, causing hydrocephalus. Symptoms include headaches, dizziness, and unsteadiness. Treatment involves surgery to remove most of the tumour and restore CSF flow, followed by radiotherapy directed using stereotactic localization. Medulloblastoma is the second most common form of cancer of childhood (after leukaemia); recent advances have improved the survival rate so that $40 \%$ of affected children live for more than five years.
