- a bloodsucking insect of the genus Cimex. C. hemipterus of the tropics and C. lectularius of temperate regions have reddish flattened bodies and vestigial wings. They live and lay their eggs in the crevices of walls and furniture and emerge at night to suck blood; although bed bugs are not known vectors of disease their bites leave a route for bacterial infection. Premises can be disinfested with appropriate insecticides.
