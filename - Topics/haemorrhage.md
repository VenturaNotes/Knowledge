- (bleeding) $n$. the escape of blood from a ruptured blood vessel, externally or internally. Arterial blood is bright red and emerges in spurts, venous blood is dark red and flows steadily, while damage to minor vessels may produce only an oozing. Rupture of a major blood vessel such as the femoral artery can lead to the loss of several litres of blood in a few minutes, resulting in shock, collapse, and death, if untreated. See also HAEMATEMESIS; HAEMATURIA; HAEMOPTYSIS.
