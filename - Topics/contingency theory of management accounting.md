- The theory that there is no single management accounting system acceptable to all organizations or any system that is satisfactory in all circumstances in a single organization. Consequently, accounting systems are contingent upon the circumstances that prevail at any time; they must be capable of development in order to take into consideration such factors as changes in the environment, competition, organizational structures, and technology.
