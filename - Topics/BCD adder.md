- A 4-bit binary adder that is capable of adding two 4-bit words having a BCD (binary-coded decimal) format. The result of the addition is a BCD-format 4-bit output word, representing the decimal sum of the addend and augend, and a carry that is generated if this sum exceeds a decimal value of 9 . Decimal addition is thus possible using these devices.
