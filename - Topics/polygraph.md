- $n$. An instrument for the simultaneous recording of several largely involuntary physiological responses controlled by the autonomic nervous system, usually skin conductance or galvanic skin response (GSR), respiration rate (monitored by a pneumograph and producing separate traces for chest movement and abdominal movement), blood pressure, and heart rate. It is sometimes used as a lie detector. The original instrument of this type was the Keeler polygraph. \[From Greek polygraphos writing copiously, from polys many + graphein to write]
