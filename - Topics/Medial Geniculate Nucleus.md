## Synthesis
- Located in the thalamus receiving processed auditory signals from the inferior colliculus and transmits them to the auditory cortex for further processing and analysis
- Located in the thalamus
- Relays sensory information to the cerebral cortex
- Receives processed auditory signals from the inferior colliculus in the midbrain and transmits these signals to the auditory cortex in the temporal lobe. 
- Plays a critical role in the organization and transmission of auditory information for further processing and analysis in higher brain regions involved in auditory perception and interpretation
