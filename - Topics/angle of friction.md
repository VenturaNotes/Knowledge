- The angle $\lambda$ such that $tan \lambda = \mu_s$, where $\mu_s$ is the coefficient of static friction. Consider a block resting on a horizontal plane, as shown in the figure. In the limiting case when the block is about to move to the right on account of an applied force of magnitude P, $N = mg$, $P = F$, and $F = \mu_sN$. Then the contact force, whose components are $N$ and $F$, makes an angle $\lambda$ with the vertical.
