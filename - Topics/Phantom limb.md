- A condition in which someone who has lost a part of their body continues to experience phantom sensations coming from that body part
## Source[^2]
- the sensation that an arm or leg, or part of an arm or leg, is still attached to the body after it has been amputated. Pain may seem to come from the amputated part. This may arise because of stimulation of the amputation stump, which contains severed nerves that formerly carried messages from the removed portion, but more usually occurs because the neural representation of the limb is still present in the brain and may become activated.
