- An important probability distribution with many uses in statistical analysis. Denoted by the Greek symbol $\mathrm{X}^{2}$, it is the distribution of the sum of squares of $f$ independent random variables, each being drawn from the normal distribution with zero mean and unit variance. The integer $f$ is the number of degrees of freedom. Critical values of the probability distribution are widely available in tables, but exact calculations involve the incomplete gamma function. The most common applications are
	- (a) testing for interactions between different classifications of data using contingency tables;
	- (b) testing goodness-of-fit;
	- (c) forming confidence intervals for estimates of variance.
