- Enterprise social software uses the format of social media platforms within a corporate setting to ensure seamless communication and collaboration. Aspects of social media such as image sharing, microblogging, a timeline of actions, and instant messaging are repurposed and rebranded for the sole use of an enterprise. The aim is to help employees communicate more efficiently and collaborate better. Some tools also enable communication with customers or clients. Slack is an example of enterprise social software.
