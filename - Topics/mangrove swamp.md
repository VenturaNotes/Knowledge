- A region of vegetation, found along tropical coasts, in which mangrove trees (Rhizophora species) predominate. The waterlogged soil is highly saline, and$\textemdash$like other halophytes$\textemdash$mangroves are adapted to withstand these conditions; they also possess aerial roots (pneumatophores) through which gaseous exchange occurs, to counteract effects of the badly aerated soil. Mangroves are not only complex ecosystems but also play a vital role in protecting coastal regions from the effects of tropical storms and high tides.
