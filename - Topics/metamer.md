## Source [^1]
- $n$. Either of a pair of colors that appear identical but have different spectral compositions and are therefore composed of different wavelengths. A mixture of two non-complementary colors produces a color that appears identical to a pure colour intermediate on the color circle between the component colors of the mixture but that has a different spectral composition from the pure color. \[From Greek meta beside + English (iso)mer, from Greek isos equal or the same + meros a part]
