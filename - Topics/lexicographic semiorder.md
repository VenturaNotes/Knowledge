- $n$. A lexicographic preference ordering applied to a set of elements differing on two or more attributes, at least one of which yields a semiorder. It is noteworthy because it can generate an intransitive preference ordering from intuitively reasonable transitive preferences within each separate attribute. For example, suppose three job applicants $x, y$, and $z$ are ranked according to aptitude test scores and interview performance, and interview performance is taken into account only if the difference in aptitude test score between two candidates is less than five points and is therefore considered to be negligible. Suppose that the data are as follows:

	- Candidate Aptitude Interview
		- Good
		- Moderate
		- Week
- Then $x$ is preferred to $y, y$ is preferred to $z$, and $z$ is preferred to $x$. Also called a lexical semiorder, though this is apt to cause confusion.
