- $n$. the state or feeling of having lost a loved one, especially through death. It is usually manifest as mental anguish (grief), and bereaved people may lose weight, cry without ceasing, withdraw and wish themselves dead, or suffer from abnormal perceptions (that they hear or see the departed). Bereavement should be distinguished from other conditions. As in other forms of loss, acceptance will usually come, but in some situations, such as a mother losing a child, the feeling is life-long and may deepen with time.
