- (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) A sensitive technique (see IMMUNOASSAY) for accurately determining the amount of protein or other antigen in a given sample by means of an enzyme-catalysed color change. Antibody specific to the test protein is adsorbed onto a solid substrate, such as a PVC sheet, and a measured amount of the sample is added; all molecules of the test protein in the sample are bound by the antibody. A second antibody specific for a second site on the test protein is added; this is conjugated with an enzyme, which catalyses a color change in the fourth reagent, added finally to the sheet. The color change can be measured photometrically and compared against a standard curve to give the concentration of protein in the sample. ELISA is widely used for diagnostic and other purposes.
