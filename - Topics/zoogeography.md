- The study of the geographical distributions of animals. The earth can be divided into several faunal regions separated by natural barriers, such as oceans, deserts, and mountain ranges. The characteristics of the fauna of each region are believed to depend particularly (but not wholly) on the process of continental drift and the stage of evolution reached when the various land masses became isolated. For example Australia, which has been isolated since Cretaceous times, has the most primitive native mammalian fauna, consisting solely of marsupials and monotremes. See also WALLACE'S LINE.
