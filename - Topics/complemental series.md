- $n$. In psychoanalysis, an arrangement or distribution of a group of cases, from one extreme where hereditary causes predominate, to the other extreme where environmental causes predominate, enabling any specific case to be assigned to a position on a scale according to the relative contributions of nature and nurture. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) expounded this concept most clearly in 1916-17 in his Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis (Standard Edition, XV-XVI, especially at pp. $346\text{-}7,362)$.
