- $n$. The third law of thermodynamics, according to which as a homogeneous system approaches a temperature of absolute zero its entropy tends to zero. \[Named after the German physical chemist Walther Hermann Nernst (1864-1941) who formulated it in 1906]

- A statement of the third law of thermodynamics in a restricted form given by Walter Nernst: if a chemical change takes place between pure crystalline solids at absolute zero there is no change of entropy. Nernst put forward his theorem in 1906.
