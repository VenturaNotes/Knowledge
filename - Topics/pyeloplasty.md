- $n$. an operation to relieve obstruction at the junction of the pelvis of the kidney and the ureter. The procedure is often performed laparoscopically. The narrowed segment may be excised and the renal pelvis and ureteric ends anastomosed or a flap of tissue from the renal pelvis may be folded down to widen the narrowing. A ureteric stent is left in place while healing takes place. See HYDRONEPHROSIS; DIETL'S CRISIS.
