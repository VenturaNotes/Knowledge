- The study of climates of earlier geological periods. This is based largely on the study of sediments that were laid down during these periods and of fossils. The changes in the positions of the continents as a result of continental drift and plate tectonics complicate the study. Determination of historical perturbations in the climate provides vital information for the construction of accurate climate models that can predict the trajectory of future climate change.
