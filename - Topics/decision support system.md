## Source [^1]
- (DSS) A computer system specifically designed to assist managers in making unstructured or semistructured decisions, i.e. when the nature of the problem requiring a decision is not known in advance. A language subsystem has to be included in the DSS to allow users to communicate easily with the system and a problem processing subsystem, such as a spreadsheet, is also required. Typically, a system of this type has a store of internal data and is able to access external data. A group decision support system (GDSS) is designed to facilitate group decision making, whereas an executive information system (EIS) is specially tailored for senior executives. See also DATA WAREHOUSING; EXPERT SYSTEM; MANAGEMENT INFORMATION SYSTEM.
