- Serving GRPS support node (SGSN) is an important part of a general packet radio service (GPRS) network. GPRS networks are used for mobile devices with 2G or 3G connections and not for those that use 4G (or newer) connections.Â SGSN sends data from the original source (e.g., a 3G phone) through a radio network known as the RAN to the recipient specified by the 3G phone user, and vice versa. SGSN makes data transfer possible through compatible devices.
