## Source [^1]
- $n$. an antibiotic, derived from the bacterium Streptomyces venezuelae and also produced synthetically, that is effective against a wide variety of microorganisms. However, due to its serious side-effects, especially damage to the bone marrow, it is usually reserved for serious infections (especially those caused by Haemophilus influenzae) when less toxic drugs are ineffective. Chloramphenicol is also used in the form of eye drops to treat superficial eye infections.
