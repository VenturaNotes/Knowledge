- (normalizing selection) Natural selection that acts to maintain the constancy of a species over successive generations. It involves selection against the extremes of the range of phenotypes for a particular characteristic. For example, babies whose birth weight is substantially below or above the average of 3.6 kg historically have a greater mortality than babies of average birth weight (although medical advances have now greatly reduced this pattern of selection in humans). Compare DIRECTIONAL SELECTION; DISRUPTIVE SELECTION. See also BALANCING SELECTION.
