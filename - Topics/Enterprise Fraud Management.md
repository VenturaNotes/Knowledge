- Enterprise fraud management consists of tools designed to detect unauthorized use. It does this by deploying various algorithms and security measures that can ensure only authorized users access the software and its critical components. It also requires that staff understand when a transaction may be fraudulent. EFM checks users, database access, and more. It can be used to determine unauthorized access by individuals or attempts to hack a computer network. Cybersecurity is one of the most significant long-term issues facing the business community, making EFM highly relevant.
