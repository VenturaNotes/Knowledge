- (FCA) The new regulatory body for the UK financial services industry that was established in April 2013; it is one of two successor bodies to the Financial Services Authority (FSA) created under the Financial Services Act 2012, the other being the Prudential Regulation Authority. The FCA is responsible for regulating conduct in both retail and wholesale financial markets and the infrastructure that supports them. The new body is intended to be a more robust regulator than the FSA; it has said that it will intervene more quickly to ban risky financial products and enforce its rulings with tougher penalties.

- (FCA) An independent regulator of the financial industry in the UK. The FCA, along with the Prudential Regulation Authority, were set up in 2012 to replace the Financial Services Authority. The main tasks of the FCA are to maintain and ensure the integrity of the market, to regulate financial services firms so that they give consumers a fair deal, and to ensure the financial services market is competitive. The FCA is accountable to the Treasury but its funding comes from the fees paid by the firms it regulates.
