- (FCA) The new regulatory body for the UK financial services industry that was established in April 2013; it is one of two successor bodies to the Financial Services Authority (FSA) created under the Financial Services Act 2012, the other being the Prudential Regulation Authority. The FCA is responsible for regulating conduct in both retail and wholesale financial markets and the infrastructure that supports them. The new body is intended to be a more robust regulator than the FSA; it has said that it will intervene more quickly to ban risky financial products and enforce its rulings with tougher penalties.
