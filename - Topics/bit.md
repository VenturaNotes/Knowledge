## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A bit is also known as a binary digit
- It is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store
- A bit is always in one of two physical states, similar to an on/off light switch
- The state is represented by a single binary value, usually a 0 or 1
	- Can also be represented by yes/no, on/off, or true/false
- Bits are stored in [[memory]] through the use of [[capacitor|capacitors]] that hold electrical charges
## Source[^2]
- A binary digit. The basic unit of data within a computer system that has the value 0 or 1.
## Source[^3]
- (1) Either of the two digits 0 and 1 in the binary number system. Bits are used in computing for the internal representation of numbers, characters, and instructions. The bit is the smallest unit of storage and hence of information in any binary system within a computer. 
- (2) The fundamental unit of information used in information theory. It is the quantity of information required to distinguish between a pair of equiprobable events.
## Source[^4]
- A quantity which can take on the value of 0 or 1.
## Source[^5]
- Abbreviation for binary digit, i.e. either 0 or 1 . A bit is the unit of information and (Shannon) entropy.
## Source[^6]
- $n$. In computer technology, a single digit in binary notation symbolized by either 0 or 1 , represented by a switch that is either off or on, a location on a disk or a tape that is either not magnetized or magnetized, or the absence or presence of an electrical or electronic pulse. In information theory, it is the standard unit of information (2), representing the information required to specify one of two alternatives, the number of bits in a given signal being defined by the minimum number of binary digits required to encode it. The binary equivalents of the decimal digits $0,1,2,3$, $4,5,6,7,8$, and 9 are $0,1,10,11,100,101,110,111,1000$, and 1001, respectively; therefore, if the information specifies a choice of one out of just two alternatives, then one bit of information is sufficient to encode the information, three or four alternatives require two bits, five to eight alternatives require three bits, nine or ten alternatives require four bits, and so on. See also baud, binary code, Boolean, byte, nybble. \[A blend of $b$(inary) and (dig)it, named in the 1940s by the US statistician John Wilder Tukey (1915-2000)]
