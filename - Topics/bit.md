## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A bit is also known as a binary digit
- It is the smallest unit of data that a computer can process and store
- A bit is always in one of two physical states, similar to an on/off light switch
- The state is represented by a single binary value, usually a 0 or 1
	- Can also be represented by yes/no, on/off, or true/false
- Bits are stored in [[memory]] through the use of [[capacitor|capacitors]] that hold electrical charges
## Source[^2]
- A binary digit. The basic unit of data within a computer system that has the value 0 or 1.
## Source[^3]
- (1) Either of the two digits 0 and 1 in the binary number system. Bits are used in computing for the internal representation of numbers, characters, and instructions. The bit is the smallest unit of storage and hence of information in any binary system within a computer. 
- (2) The fundamental unit of information used in information theory. It is the quantity of information required to distinguish between a pair of equiprobable events.

## Source[^4]
- A quantity which can take on the value of 0 or 1.
