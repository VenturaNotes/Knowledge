- n. (pl. telangiectases) a localized collection of distended blood capillary vessels. It is recognized as a red spot, sometimes spidery in appearance (see SPIDER NAEVUS), that blanches on pressure. Telangiectases may be found in the skin or the lining of the mouth or in the gastrointestinal, respiratory, and urinary tracts. The condition in which multiple telangiectases occur is termed telangiectasia. It may be seen as an inherited condition associated with a bleeding tendency (hereditary haemorrhagic telangiectasia: see Osler-Rendu-Weber disease). Accessible bleeding telangiectases (e.g. in the nose) may be obliterated by cauterization.
