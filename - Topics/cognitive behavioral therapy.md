- (CBT) a cognitive therapy that is combined with behavioral elements (see BEHAVIORAL THERAPY). The patient is encouraged to analyse his or her specific ways of thinking around a problem. The therapist then looks at the resulting behavioral and the consequences of that thinking and tries to encourage the patient to change his or her cognition in order to avoid adverse behavioral or its consequences. CBT is successfully used to treat phobias, anxiety, and depression (it is among the recommended treatments for anxiety and depression in the NICE guidelines).
