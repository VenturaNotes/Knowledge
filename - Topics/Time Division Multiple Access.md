- Time-division multiple access (TDMA) allows several people to have phone conversations at the same time. It is a type of digital modulation. Cell phone providers might use TDMA to transmit data. These companies rely on this technology to provide mobile phone services through something called GSM, which is the standard for 2G mobile data. TDMA divides the frequency bandwidth of network signals into different "time slots." Then it transmits those signals in succession. Each signal now has its own time slot, which speeds up data transmission and improves voice communications. Similar technology to TDMA used in North America is called NA-TDMA.
