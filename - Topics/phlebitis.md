- $n$. inflammation of the wall of a vein, which is most commonly seen in the legs as a complication of varicose veins. A segment of vein becomes painful and tender and the surrounding skin feels hot and appears red. Thrombosis commonly develops (see THROMBOPHLEBITIS). Treatment consists of elastic support together with drugs, such as NSAIDs, to relieve the inflammation and pain. Anticoagulants are not used (compare PHLEBOTHROMBOSIS). Phlebitis may also complicate sepsis (see PYLEPHLEBITIS) or cancer, especially of the stomach, bronchus, or pancreas. In pancreatic cancer the phlebitis may affect a variety of veins (thrombophlebitis migrans).
