- (PTSD) an anxiety disorder caused by a major physical or emotional trauma, such as an injury, assault, rape, or exposure to warfare or a disaster involving many casualties. The onset is at least one month after the traumatic event. The patient experiences the persistent recurrence of images or memories of the event, together with nightmares, insomnia, a sense of isolation, guilt, irritability, and loss of concentration. Emotions may be flat and depression may develop. The condition usually settles with time, but support and skilled counseling may be needed. More severe cases may be treated by eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy (EMDR), cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressants, and in severe cases also with antipsychotics.

A trauma- and stressor-related disorder in DSM-5, also considered an anxiety disorder, arising as a delayed and protracted response to experiencing or witnessing a traumatic event involving actual or threatened death, serious injury, or sexual violence to self or others. It is characterized by recurrent, involuntary, intrusive, distressing memories of the traumatic event or dreams related to it; flashbacks (2) causing the individual to feel or act as though the trauma were recurring; intense distress and physiological reactions in response to anything reminiscent of the traumatic event; persistent avoidance of stimuli associated with the trauma; a numbing of responsiveness and heightened arousal, manifested as insomnia, irritability, difficulty in concentrating, hypervigilance, or exaggerated startle response; and sometimes depersonalization or derealization.
