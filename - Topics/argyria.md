- (argyrosis) $n$. the deposition of silver in the skin and other tissues, either resulting from industrial exposure or following ingestion or long-term administration of silver salts. A slate-grey pigmentation develops slowly; this is accentuated in areas exposed to light. Deposition of silver in the conjunctiva, corneal epithelium, stroma, and Descemet's membrane is usually due to chronic exposure to silver compounds or instillation of eye drops containing silver.
