- (termination codon) The triplet of nucleotides on a messenger RNA molecule (see CODON) at which the process of translation ends. It is recognized by proteins called release factors, which bind to the A site of the ribosome. This effectively stops the formation of a polypeptide chain at that point. The three stop codons are UGA, UAA, and UAG (see GENETIC CODE). Compare START CODON.
