- The range of environmental temperatures over which the heat produced by a 'warm-blooded' animal (see ENDOTHERM) remains fairly constant. Hence, it is the range in which the animal is 'comfortable', having neither to generate extra heat to keep warm nor expend metabolic energy on cooling mechanisms, such as panting. Animals adapted to cold environments tend to have broader thermoneutral zones than ones living in hot environments.
