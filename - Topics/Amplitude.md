- Suppose that $x = A sin(\omega t + \alpha)$, where $A (> 0)$, $\omega$ and $\alpha$ are constants. This may, for example, give the displacement x of a particle, moving in a straight line, at time t. The particle is thus oscillating about the origin O. The constant A is the amplitude and gives the maximum distance in each direction from O that the particle attains. ($\omega$ is the angular frequency and $\alpha$ is the phase)
- The term may also be used in the case of damped oscillations to mean the corresponding coefficient, even though it is not constant. For example, if $x = 5e^{-2t} sin3t$, the oscillations are said to have amplitude $5e^{-2t}$, which tends to zero as t tends to infinity
## Source[^2]
- The height of an analogue wave, measured from its rest level, at a given point in time. For sound waves, this is a measurement of volume.

- n. Size, extent, or magnitude, especially of a vibratory movement or the displacement of a periodic oscillation or wave, its instantaneous amplitude being its displacement at a specific moment from the zero or mean position and its peak amplitude being the maximum displacement that it attains, peak amplitude usually being implied when the term is unqualified. It is the physical counterpart of the psychological sensations of loudness in a sound wave and of lightness or brightness in a light wave. See also decibel. \[From Latin amplitudo breadth, from amplus spacious]
