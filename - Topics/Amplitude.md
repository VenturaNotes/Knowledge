- Suppose that $x = A sin(\omega t + \alpha)$, where $A (> 0)$, $\omega$ and $\alpha$ are constants. This may, for example, give the displacement x of a particle, moving in a straight line, at time t. The particle is thus oscillating about the origin O. The constant A is the amplitude and gives the maximum distance in each direction from O that the particle attains. ($\omega$ is the angular frequency and $\alpha$ is the phase)
- The term may also be used in the case of damped oscillations to mean the corresponding coefficient, even though it is not constant. For example, if $x = 5e^{-2t} sin3t$, the oscillations are said to have amplitude $5e^{-2t}$, which tends to zero as t tends to infinity

- The height of an analogue wave, measured from its rest level, at a given point in time. For sound waves, this is a measurement of volume.
