- $n$. (of the aorta) a congenital narrowing of a short segment of the aorta. The most common site of coarctation is just beyond the origin of the left subclavian artery from the aorta. This results in high blood pressure (hypertension) in the upper part of the body and arms and low blood pressure in the legs. The defect is corrected by surgery or stent implantation.
