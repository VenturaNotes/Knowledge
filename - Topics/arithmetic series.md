- A series $a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+\ldots$ (which may be finite or infinite) in which the terms form an arithmetic sequence. Let $s_{n}$ be the $n$th partial sum (that is, the sum of the first $n$ terms). Then $s_{n}$ is given by the formula $s_{n}=\frac{1}{2} n(a+l)$ where $a$ is the first term and $l$ is the last ( $n$th) term. In particular, when $a=1$ and the common difference $d=1$: $$\sum_{r=1}^{n}r=1 + 2 + \cdots+n=\frac 12n(n+1)$$
