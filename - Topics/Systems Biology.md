- An approach that seeks to study organisms as complete systems$\textemdash$networks of interacting genes, biomolecules, and biochemical reactions, i.e. the interactome. It thus attempts to integrate all relevant structural and functional information, rather than focusing on, say, just one particular gene or protein at a time. This involves amassing and organizing data obtained from genomics, proteomics, and other areas of bioinformatics and managing and analyzing the data to identify patterns, formulate hypotheses, and ultimately create computer models that will enable accurate predictions of cellular and organismal responses. Such models could have a radical impact on medicine and biology in the future. For example, aberrations in a particular cancer patient could enable treatment tailored to that individual's particular form of cancer.
