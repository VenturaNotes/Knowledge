- $n$. the study of how drugs are handled within the body, including their absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion. It is concerned with such matters as how drug concentration in the body changes with time, how drugs pass across cell membranes, how often they should be given, what the effect of long-term administration may be, how drugs interact with each other, and how individual variations affect all these things.
## Source[^2]
- The movement of foreign substances, particularly drugs, throughout the body of an animal. Processes that influence the pharmacokinetics of a compound include uptake, distribution throughout the body tissues, the length of time the compound remains in the body, and its rate of clearance (e.g. by metabolism or excretion).
