- The order of mammals that comprises the elephants. They are herbivorous, with a muscular trunk (proboscis) used for drinking, bathing, and collecting food. The tusks are continuously growing upper incisors and the enormous ridged molar teeth are produced in sequence to replace worn teeth throughout life. The order, which evolved in the Eocene epoch, was formerly much larger and more widespread than it is today and included the extinct mammoths. Two species of modern elephants are generally recognized, the African elephant (Loxodonta africana) and Asian elephant (Elephas maximus), although there is evidence that there may be an additional African species, the forest elephant (L. cyclotis). The African elephant is now classed as 'vulnerable' and the Asian elephant as 'endangered', due to a combination of poaching and habitat loss.
