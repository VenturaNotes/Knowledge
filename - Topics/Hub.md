## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- In terms of networking, hubs are also known as repeaters or concentrators
	- However, a hub and a [[concentrator]] are both devices that connect multiple devices, but they can have different uses
		- A hub is a networking device that connects multiple devices within a local area network ([[LAN]])
		- A concentrator is a device that combines multiple channels onto a single transmission medium

## Source[^2]
- A hub can also be referred to as repeaters or concentrators, and they serve as the center of a [[LAN]]

## Source[^3]
- The hub is specified in the [[physical layer]]

## Source[^4]
- In general, a unit that operates in some sense as the centre of a star configuration. In the case of a network, a hub acts as a local concentrator that allows a number of devices, connected to the hub in a star configuration, to connect to a network with an arbitrary configuration. In the special case of an Ethernet network, a hub may refer to a device that provides connection for a number of end-user devices, each using a dedicated twisted pair (usually CAT-5 or CAT-6 cables) local connection, to an Ethernet segment running on either a coaxial cable (thick or thin Ethernet) or an optical fibre. Apart from connecting and configuring devices, a hub has no intelligence: it belongs to the physical layer.
