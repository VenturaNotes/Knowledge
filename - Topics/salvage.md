- (1) Goods, property, etc., saved from a shipwreck or from a fire. If a cargo is treated as a total loss for insurance purposes, there still may be salvageable items that have a salvage value; these may be sold by the insurers or allowed for in the settlement of their claim. 
- (2) A reward paid to persons who help to save a ship, goods, etc., voluntarily and at some danger to themselves. Salvage money cannot be paid to anyone responsible for the care of the ship. The reward is paid by the owners of the ship or the cargo and the salvors have a lien on the property rescued for the salvage money.
