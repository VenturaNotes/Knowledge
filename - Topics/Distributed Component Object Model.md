- Distributed Component Object Model (DCOM) is an extension of the Component Object Model (COM) that allows Microsoft applications to interact with each other across various networking environments. DCOM can be used to interact between different hardware devices.
- Unlike the traditional COM, the DCOM allows a computer to run programs on another computer over the network as if the program were running in the same environment. Businesses that use Windows applications employ DCOM to ease communications between internal and external stakeholders operating on different machines.
