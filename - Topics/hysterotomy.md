- $n$. an operation for removal of the fetus by incision of the uterus through the abdomen before the 24th week of gestation; after this time the operation is called Caesarean section. Hysterotomy is now rarely performed owing to improvements in the efficiency of drugs now available for inducing abortion, e.g. mifepristone.
