## Source [^1]
- Amino acid involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine
- When dopamine produced in brain, the amino acid tyrosine is first converted to L-DOPA and then converted to dopamine
- Dopamine administered as a drug can't pass the [[blood-brain barrier]], but L-DOPA can to enter the brain
	- Therefore, L-DOPA most common treatment for [[Parkinson's disease]]
- Remarkable ability to reduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease in some patients
- Brain able to use L-DOPA to synthesize more dopamine and replenish its depleted dopamine stores
