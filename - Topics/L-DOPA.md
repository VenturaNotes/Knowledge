## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Amino acid involved in the synthesis of the neurotransmitter dopamine
- When dopamine produced in brain, the amino acid tyrosine is first converted to L-DOPA and then converted to dopamine
- Dopamine administered as a drug can't pass the [[blood-brain barrier]], but L-DOPA can to enter the brain
	- Therefore, L-DOPA most common treatment for [[Parkinson's disease]]
- Remarkable ability to reduce symptoms of Parkinson's disease in some patients
- Brain able to use L-DOPA to synthesize more dopamine and replenish its depleted dopamine stores
## Source[^2]
- abbrev. Laevo-dihydroxyphenylalanine, a substance that is synthesized in the body from tyrosine and is an immediate precursor of dopamine. Dopamine cannot cross the blood-brain barrier, but L-dopa can, therefore a synthetic form of L-dopa is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, which arises from a failure of dopamine production in the brain. Also called levodopa. See also antiparkinsonian, aphrodisiac, DOPA. \[From laevo- indicating a left-handed form, from Latin laevus left + d(ihydr)o(xy)p(henyl)a(lanine)]
