- genes associated with susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer. Women with mutations in either of these genes have a 56-$85 \%$ risk of developing breast cancer, and this form of the cancer tends to develop at a relatively young age. The risk of ovarian cancer is $36-66 \%$ in women with BRCA1 mutations and 10-20% with BRCA2. Targeted therapy specific to these mutations using a PARP inhibitor is undergoing investigation.
