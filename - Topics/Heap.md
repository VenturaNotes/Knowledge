## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (1) An area of storage used for dynamic allocation of data structures where the order of releasing the allocated data structure is indeterminate. Compare STACK. 
- (2) A complete binary tree (see COMPLETE TREE) in which the value at each node is at least as large as the values at its children (if they exist). Heaps are used to implement priority queues.
## Source[^2]
- A heap is a complete binary tree [[data structure]] that satisfies the heap property: for every node, the value of its children is greater than or equal to its own value.

	- #question What is meant by "heap property?" For it to be a heap, does this need to be true for every version? What about max heap vs min heap? Wouldn't this type of property change then?
