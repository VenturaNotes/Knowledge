- A variety of inequalities that apply, generally or specifically, to error-detecting and error-correcting codes, setting bounds to their performance as expressed by parameters such as the number of codewords (see BLOCK CODE), minimum Hamming distance, codeword length, and efficiency. Of the many bounds that are known, the most important are the Hamming bound and the Gilbert-Varshamov bound.
