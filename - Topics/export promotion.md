- (1) Government activities to help sell exports by providing export incentives at home, and various forms of practical assistance for exporters abroad. These include advice on local trading laws and practices, the provision of export credits or guarantees on favorable terms, and diplomatic pressure, including tying aid to export sales.
- (2) A strategy for promoting economic development in less developed countries. This involves running an open economy, relying on foreign markets to allow export-led growth.
