- $n$. a specialized ring of muscle that surrounds an orifice. Contractions of the sphincter partly or completely close the orifice. Sphincters are found, for example, around the anus (anal sphincter) and at the openings between the oesophagus and stomach (lower oesophageal sphincter, LOS) and between the stomach and duodenum (pyloric sphincter).
## Source[^2]
- A specialized muscle encircling an opening or orifice. Contraction of the sphincter tends to close the orifice. Examples are the anal sphincter (round the opening of the anus) and the pyloric sphincter (at the lower opening of the stomach). A precapillary sphincter is a ring of smooth muscle that surrounds the entrance to a capillary bed and by contracting restricts the entry of blood.
