- (PA) A formal document giving one person the right to act for another. A power to execute a deed must itself be given by a deed. An attorney may not delegate these powers unless specifically authorized to do so.

- authority given by an individual to another person (a proxy) to take decisions on their behalf, either immediately or after they lose mental capacity in relation to their financial affairs, or only after they lose capacity in relation to their personal welfare and health care. In the UK the proxy has responsibility for representing the patient's best interests, but he or she can refuse life-sustaining treatment for the patient only if express written provision for such a decision was made by the patient in advance (see ADVANCE DIRECTIVE, DECISION, OR STATEMENT). The only circumstances in which the wishes of the proxy need not be followed is where clinicians believe that he or she is not acting in the patient's best interests. See also ADVOCACY; PROXY DECISION; SUBSTITUTED JUDGMENT.
