- (intrauterine fetal death) $n$. birth of a fetus that shows no evidence of life (heartbeat, respiration, or independent movement) at any time later than 24 weeks after conception. Under the Stillbirth (Definition) Act 1992, there is a legal obligation to notify all stillbirths to the appropriate authority. The number of such births expressed per 1000 births (live and still) is known as the stillbirth rate. In legal terms, viability is deemed to start at the 24th week of pregnancy and a fetus born dead before this time is known as a miscarriage or abortion. However, some fetuses born alive before the 24th week may now survive as a result of improved perinatal care. See also CONFIDENTIAL ENQUIRIES.
