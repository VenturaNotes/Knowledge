- A method for displaying equations between functions. For example, suppose that there is a function $\phi$ of the form $$\phi: X \to Y$$and what is needed is to represent or code the data in $X$ and $Y$, and the function, by means of the data sets A and B, respectively. Functions $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are chosen where $$\alpha: A \to X \text{ and } \beta: B \to Y$$and a function f: $A \to B$ is defined to be a representation or function for $\phi$ on the code sets A and B if, for all $a \in A$, the following equation holds: $$\phi \alpha (a) = \beta f(a)$$The equation is depicted by the commutative diagram shown in the figure
- Equations and commutative diagrams of this form play an important role in relating different levels of abstraction, and are used to formulate the correctness of data-type implementations, compilers, and machine architectures. As equations grow in complexity, commutative diagrams become essential. See also COMPUTABLE ALGEBRA
