- legislation for England and Wales, which came into force in October 2007, to govern the treatment of people who lack capacity to make decisions. It gives legal force to the importance of autonomy in health care and to advance directives, decisions, or statements. It also provides statutory legislation for medical and social decision-makers to act in the patient's best interests should he or she lose capacity (see Independent Mental Capacity Advocate). It allows proportionate force to implement decisions made in a patient's best interests. For Scotland the current legislation is the Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000.
