- Adding one's signature to a bill of exchange, thereby accepting liability to pay the bill at maturity if the original signatory fails to do so. Acceptance of a bill of exchange by an institution of high financial standing, such as a merchant bank, makes the bill safer to hold and thus easier to sell. The acceptor is taking a risk, and makes a charge for this.
