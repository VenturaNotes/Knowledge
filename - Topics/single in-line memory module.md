## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A memory IC (integrated circuit) whose pin-out corresponds to the SIL format. Because the pins lie along one edge of the device package, it can be mounted on a PCB in a perpendicular plane, minimizing the board area occupied and maximizing the packing density. See also MEMORY CARD.
## Source[^2]
- A SIMM increases the available RAM (random access memory) on a computer. RAM provides computers with the ability to multitask and do tasks at speed, and typically, the greater the RAM, the better the performance. SIMM combines memory modules on a small circuit board. This plugs into a slot that connects to the motherboard of the computer. Some computers have several slots. This allows the RAM to be expanded multiple times. It's important to note that while some older systems still use SIMM, in most cases they have been replaced by Dual Inline Memory Modules (DIMM), which are much faster and more efficient.
