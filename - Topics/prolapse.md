- $n$. downward displacement of an organ or tissue from its normal position, usually the result of weakening of the supporting tissues. Prolapse of the uterus and/or vagina is, in most cases, caused by stretching and/or tearing of the supporting tissues during childbirth. The cervix may be visible at the vaginal opening or the uterus and vagina may be completely outside the opening (procidentia). Treatment is by surgical shortening of the supporting ligaments and narrowing of the vagina and vaginal orifice (see COLPORRHAPHY; COLPOPERINEORRHAPHY) or by surgical removal of the uterus (vaginal hysterectomy). In a rectal prolapse, the rectum descends to lie outside the anus; it is surgically treated (see RECTOPEXY).
