- Return merchandise authorization (RMA) is a system used by retailers to manage product returns. RMA systems allow customers to request a product refund, repair, or replacement from their product vendor if they are dissatisfied with the product they receive. Typically, a customer will receive an RMA number—assigned by the vendorʻs customer service team—for the product they wish to return. The customer will then receive an RMA form that details the vendorʻs return policy and instructions for how to return the package. Once this information about the product is received by the vendor, the vendor will issue the customer a full or partial refund (depending on the vendorʻs return policy).
