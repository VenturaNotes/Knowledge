## Source [^1]
- $n$. one of a group of proteins found in the globulin fraction of blood plasma. Mucoproteins are globulins combined with a carbohydrate group (an amino sugar). They are similar to glycoproteins but contain a greater proportion of carbohydrate.
## Source[^2]
- A glycoprotein in which the carbohydrate component is a relatively large polysaccharide. Mucoproteins readily form gels with water and constitute the mucin in mucus. The mucoprotein chains are joined end to end by disulphide bonds, forming very long mucin strands. When released into water, the network of strands expands rapidly to produce a large volume of mucus.
