- The body responsible for all international data-processing standards, and many others. It was founded in 1947 and its members comprise national standards bodies in over 160 countries. In the field of computing, it is best known for the ISO9000 series of standards for quality management and the OSI (open systems interconnection) seven layer model for communications (ISO ISO7498). It works closely with the IEC in developing standards in other areas of hardware. In practice, the ISO does not usually develop standards itself but adopts standards developed by other standards-making bodies. Thus, for example, ISO9000 is identical to the British standard BS5750.
