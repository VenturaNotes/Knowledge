- (1) A plant that is cultivated for the purpose of harvesting its seeds, roots, leaves, or other parts that are useful to humans. See agriculture. 
- (2) An enlarged portion of the anterior section of the alimentary canal in some animals, in which food may be stored and/or undergo preliminary digestion. The term is most commonly applied to the thin-walled sac in birds between the oesophagus and the proventriculus. In female pigeons the crop contains glands that secrete crop milk, used to feed nestlings.
