- (Schönlein-Henoch purpura, anaphylactoid purpura) a common, and frequently recurrent, form of purpura found especially (but not exclusively) in young children. It is characterized by red weals and a purple rash on the buttocks and lower legs due to bleeding into the skin from inflamed capillaries, together with arthritis, gastrointestinal symptoms, and (in some cases) nephritis. Glucocorticoids are often used for treatment. \[E. H. Henoch (1820-1910), German paediatrician; J. L. Schönlein (1793-1864), German physician]
