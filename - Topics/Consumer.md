- An organism that feeds upon those below it in a food chain (i.e. at the preceding trophic level). Herbivores, which feed upon green plants, are primary consumers; a carnivore that feeds only upon herbivores is a secondary consumer; a tertiary consumer is a carnivore that feeds on other carnivores. The consumer at the end of a food chain is known as the top carnivore. Compare PRODUCER.
