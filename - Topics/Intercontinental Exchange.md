It was established in 2000 as a platform for over-the-counter energy trading and expanded into futures in 2001, when it acquired London's International Petroleum Exchange (now ICE Futures Europe). The ICE became a publicly traded company in 2005 and acquired the New York Board of Trade (now ICE Futures US) in 2007 and NYSE Euronext in 2012 (the Euronext part of the company was sold on in 2014).
