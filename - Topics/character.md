- n. 
- (1) The aggregate or combination of psychological traits that distinguish a person from others. In his influential book Personality: A Psychological Interpretation (1937), the US psychologist Gordon W(illard) Allport (1897-1967) established personality as the preferred term in psychology and rejected the word 'character' because of its ethical connotations: 'The psychologist does not need the term at all; personality alone will serve. Character is personality evaluated, and personality is character devaluated' (p. 52, italics in original). 
- (2) Any genetically determined structure, function, or phenotypic characteristic of an organism. 
- (3) A symbol, such as a letter of the alphabet, used in a system of writing; or in computer technology, any unit of information in the form of a symbol that can be represented by a unique binary code.
