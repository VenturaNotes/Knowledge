- Costs or income affecting a company's profit and loss account that do not derive from the normal activities of the company, are not expected to recur, and, if undisclosed, would distort the normal trend of profits. In traditional UK accounting practice, such items were disclosed after the normal trading profit or loss had been shown. However, under current rules virtually all previously extraordinary items are now treated as exceptional items and included in the profit and loss. The concepts of extraordinary and exceptional standards are not recognized in International Financial Reporting Standards.
