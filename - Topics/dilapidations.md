- Disrepair of leasehold premises. The landlord may be liable to repair certain parts of domestic premises (e.g. the structure and exterior, and the sanitary appliances) under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985 if the lease is for less than seven years. Otherwise, the lease will usually contain a covenant by either the landlord or the tenant obliging them to keep the premises in repair. Under the Landlord and Tenant Act 1985, a landlord cannot enforce a repairing covenant against a tenant by ending the lease prematurely unless a notice is first served specifying the disrepair and giving time for the repairs to be carried out. If there is no covenant in the lease, the tenant is under a common-law duty not to damage the premises and must keep them from falling down.
