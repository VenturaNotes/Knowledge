- $n$. In componential theory, a set of attributes or features (1) that specify the meaning of a particular concept, each a necessary or essential attribute of any instance of the concept, the entire set constituting a sufficient definition of the concept. This classical interpretation of concepts was undermined by the Austrian-born British philosopher Ludwig (Josef Johann) Wittgenstein (1889-1951), who showed in his Philosophical Investigations (1953, paragraph 66) that concepts such as game or chair lack defining properties. See feature theory, prototype THEORY. Compare CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES.
