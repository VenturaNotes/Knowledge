- $n$. A drug that controls the symptoms and slows the progression of Parkinson's disease by inhibiting the action of a monoamine oxidase enzyme that destroys dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra. It has more general anti-oxidant effects, in low doses it increases the life expectancy of experimental animals by more than twenty per cent, and it is sometimes considered to be a smart drug. See also antiPARKinsonian.
