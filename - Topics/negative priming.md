- $n$. Increased reaction time (slower responding) to a stimulus resulting from attention recently having been focused on stimuli belonging to a different class. It is a form of inhibitory priming (1) arising from the suppression of irrelevant internal representations. For example, if someone is presented with a picture of a green owl and a red cat and is asked to name the red object, internal representations activated by the green owl will tend to be inhibited, causing increased reaction time in an immediately following task requiring rapid identification of a bird or something green.
