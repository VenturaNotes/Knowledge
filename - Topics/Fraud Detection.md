- Fraud detection is a series of processes that protect business and customer information from unauthorized financial activity. It safeguards a company's accounts, transactions, and assets by analyzing the activities of people who use company computers, a business website, and other entities (such as kiosks). Fraud detection examines people's behavioral patterns when accessing information from or within a company, and also identifies characteristics commonly associated with fraudulent activities.
