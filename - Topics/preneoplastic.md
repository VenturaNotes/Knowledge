- adj. preceding the formation of a benign or malignant tumour (neoplasm). Preneoplastic lesions have the potential to give rise to tumours at that site. For example, mammary ductal epithelial hyperplasia can give rise to ductal carcinoma in situ. Preneoplastic conditions may result in tumours at that site or elsewhere. For example, ulcerative colitis predisposes to the development of colorectal adenocarcinoma and cholangiocarcinoma.
