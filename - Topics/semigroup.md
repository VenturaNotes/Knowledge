- A very simple algebraic structure comprising a set $S$ on which there is defined an associative operation denoted by ${ }^{\circ}$ (compare GROUP). The operator ${ }^{\circ}$ is assumed to take operands from the set and produce results that are also in $S$. When the set $S$ is finite a semigroup can be described by giving the Cayley table of the operation ${ }^{\circ}$; otherwise it can be described by giving a rule for ${ }^{\circ}$.
- Examples of semigroups include: strings with the operation of concatenation (joining together); the set of $n \times n$ matrices together with the operation of multiplication; the set of transformations of a set and the operation of composing functions; the integers and the operation of choosing the maximum (or minimum) of two elements. The set of integers together with subtraction does not constitute a semigroup.
- Semigroups play a major role in the theory of sequential machines and formal languages. If M is a sequential machine then any input string induces a function over the state-set of M. The set of all such induced functions forms a semigroup of the machine under function composition (see MyHill Equivalence, Nerode EQUIVALENCE). Semigroups are also used in certain aspects of computer arithmetic. See also FREE SEMIGROUP, MONOID, TRANSFORMATION SEMIGROUP.
