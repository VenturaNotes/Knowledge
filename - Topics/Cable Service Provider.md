- A cable service provider is the owner and operator of a cable television network. Service providers offer an individual or business access to cable TV. Over the past two decades, many of these companies have expanded their offerings. As a result, they are also likely to provide additional services, including phone and internet access. Cable services are usually bundled, allowing customers to purchase internet, phone, and cable access together.
