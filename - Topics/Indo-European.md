- adj. n. (Of, relating to, or belonging to) a family of languages spoken by almost half the world's population, descended from a common tongue called Proto-Indo-European that is believed to have existed in the fifth millennium BC and subsequently to have fragmented into Germanic, Italic, Celtic, Baltic, Slavic, Albanian, Greek, Armenian, Iranian, and Indic, and later still into many different languages, including English and all descendants from Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit. By working backwards, linguists have reconstructed much of the structure and vocabulary of Indo-European; thus the word for god is believed to have been deiw-os (cognate with Latin deus and Greek theos), the word for father p'tÄ“r- (cognate with Latin and Greek pater), and hence the word for the patriarchal god of Indo-European religion Dyeu p'ter-, from which Zeus pater found its way into Greek, Dyaus pitar into Sanskrit, and Jupiter into Latin and then English.
