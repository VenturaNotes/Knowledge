- Eight goals adopted by world leaders in 2000 with the intention that they will be achieved by 2015. The goals are:
	- Goal 1: Eradicate extreme poverty and hunger
	- Goal 2: Achieve universal primary education
	- Goal 3: Promote gender equality and empower women
	- Goal 4: Reduce child mortality
	- Goal 5: Improve maternal health
	- Goal 6: Combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases
	- Goal 7: Ensure environmental sustainability
	- Goal 8: Develop a Global Partnership for Development
- The Millennium Development Goals were designed to provide concrete, numerical benchmarks for tackling the many dimensions of extreme poverty. To facilitate numerical assessment of progress the eight goals have been broken down into 21 quantifiable targets which are measured by 60 indicators. The report published in 2015 concluded that, although significant achievements have been made on the targets, the progress has been uneven across countries and regions.
