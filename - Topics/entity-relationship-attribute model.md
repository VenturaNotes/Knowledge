- A model of a set of data items and relationships between them in terms of the entities, relationships, and attributes involved.
- Entities have attributes and have relationships with other entities. They have an entity name; usually names are required to be unique. Entities are often implemented as a record comprising a number of fields.
- Attributes are usually represented in a data dictionary and describe the characteristic features of the entity. Each attribute is named; usually names of attributes are required to be unique. Attributes are often implemented as fields with values.
- Each relationship has two names (a forward and a reverse name); usually relationship names are required to be unique. There can be more than one relationship between a pair of entities.
- See also ERA diagram.
