- (hydrogen acceptor) A molecule that accepts hydrogen atoms or ions, becoming reduced in the process (see OXIDATION-REDUCTION). The electron transport chain, whose function is to generate energy in the form of ATP during respiration, involves a series of hydrogen carriers, including NAD and FAD, which pass on the hydrogen (derived from the breakdown of glucose) to the next carrier in the chain. In the light reactions of photosynthesis the key hydrogen acceptor is $\mathrm{NADP}^{+}$.
