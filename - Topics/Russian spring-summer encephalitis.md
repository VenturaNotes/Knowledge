- an influenza-like viral disease that affects the brain and nervous system and occurs in Russia and central Europe. It is transmitted to humans either through the bite of forest-dwelling ticks of the species Ixodes persulcatus or by drinking the milk of infected goats. Infection of the meninges results in paralysis of the limbs and of the muscles of the neck and back. The disease, which is often fatal, can be prevented by vaccination.
