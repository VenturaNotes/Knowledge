- Excessive investment of capital, especially in the manufacturing industry towards the end of a boom as a result of overoptimistic expectations of future demand. When the boom begins to fade, the manufacturer is left with surplus capacity and can therefore make no further capital investments, which itself creates unemployment and fuels the imminent recession. It is often seen with new technology investment booms.
