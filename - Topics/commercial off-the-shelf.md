- Describing software and associated services that are commercially available as opposed to custom software. Popular examples are Microsoft Office and antivirus software. COTS products are sometimes used in the development of custom software in order to reduce cost and time, or for their quality. However, their use increases software component integration, creates dependency on the manufacturer (especially for updates), and may be subject to copyright issues.
