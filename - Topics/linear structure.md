- aka totally ordered structure
- A collection of items ordered by a single property so that each item, except possibly for the first or last, has a unique ‘predecessor’ and a unique ‘successor’. It is the most commonly used structure and appears under a variety of names depending on storage representation and its intended use. Linked representations are normally called lists while sequential representations are called arrays.”
