- The water on the surface of the earth. Some $74 \%$ of the earth's surface is covered with water, $97 \%$ (or some $1.3 \times 10^{21}$ kilograms) of which is in the oceans. Icecaps and glaciers contain about $2.6 \times 10^{19} \mathrm{~kg}$, rivers about $10^{15} \mathrm{~kg}$, lakes and inland seas about $2 \times$ $10^{17} \mathrm{~kg}$, and groundwater (down to 4000 metres) about $1.5 \times 10^{19} \mathrm{~kg}$. Water in the atmosphere contains only about $1.3 \times 10^{16} \mathrm{~kg}$.
