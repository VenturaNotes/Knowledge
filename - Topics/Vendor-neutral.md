- Vendor-neutral is a business model where no single vendor has a monopoly on all technologies used by an organization. SMBs that adopt this model select services from multiple providers based on cost, ease of use, implementation, and other factors. For example, a business might use a data center from one provider and a server from another. To qualify, a vendor must remain neutral and provide publicly available technologies or license services at a nominal fee. It must also belong to an association that:
	- Welcomes new members
	- Publishes membership rules
	- Uses unbiased business practices
	- Ensures the integrity of all technology implementations
- Vendor-neutral differs from the vendor-specific model, where vendors work on behalf of a technology company and sell its products and services.
