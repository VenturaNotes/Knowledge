- (passive transport) The random movement of particles (e.g. molecules or ions) from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration until an even distribution of particles (i.e. uniform concentration) is obtained. Small molecules and ions (such as oxygen and $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$) can diffuse across a plasma membrane.
