- Packet coalescing is a data transmission technique that merges various data packets together when sending them over a network to limit the number of interrupts (signals sent to a user computer to let them know data is available) a computer system receives. This technique helps network cards avoid overloading the host system's central processing unit (CPU) with interrupts, which often cause long load times, system crashes, or program freezes. In other words, packet coalescing lowers the amount of processing a computer has to perform to obtain network data.
