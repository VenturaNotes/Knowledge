- A plastic card similar to a credit card but having memory and a microprocessor (or specialized logic) embedded in it.
- Smart cards are defined by ISO 7816 Parts 1-6 and comprise a plastic card of size $85.6\times 53.98 \mathrm{mm}$ with a standard pattern of electrical contacts on the surface. It may also incorporate a magnetic stripe. A smart card can carry large amounts of personal and other information, which can be updated by a suitable reader. Data encryption is routinely incorporated for security. Credit cards incorporate smart card technology. However, because of their ability to store personal financial data, health records, benefit entitlements, and criminal records there is considerable controversy surrounding the expansion of smart cards' use in everyday affairs. Their possible use as personal ID cards, in particular, is a matter of political concern.
