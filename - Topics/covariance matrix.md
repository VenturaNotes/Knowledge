- For a vector of random variables $X=\left[X_{1} \ldots X_{n}\right]$, a matrix of variances of each component along the main diagonal and covariances between all pairs of components in non-diagonal elements. The covariance matrix is defined by$$\Sigma=E\left[(X-E(X))(X-E(X))^{T}\right]$$so that$$\Sigma_{i i}=\operatorname{Var}\left(X_{i}\right) \text { and } \Sigma_{i j}=\operatorname{Cov}\left(X_{i}, X_{j}\right)$$
