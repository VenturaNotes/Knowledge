- An estimate for the factorial function, named after the Scottish mathematician James Stirling (1692-1770), though it was known earlier to De Moivre. It states that $n!$ and $\sqrt{2\pi n}(n/e)^n$ are asymptotically equal. The estimate is always an underestimate, but for $n = 100$ is $99.9\%$ accurate. Bounds for $n!$ exist such as $$\sqrt{2\pi n}(\frac{n}{e})^n < n! < \sqrt{2\pi n}(\frac{n}{e})^n\text{exp}(\frac{1}{12n}).$$
