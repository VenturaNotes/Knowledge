- $n$. A response to the mind-body problem according to which mental and physical phenomena and processes are not two different kinds of things but rather different aspects of the same thing, just as a cloud and a mist are the same thing seen from different vantage points, or the morning star and the evening star are the same thing (the planet Venus). See also IDENTITY THEORY, MATERIALISM, MONISM.
