- $n$. The flat upper surface at the back of the temporal operculum in the region of Wernicke's area, extending to the end of the lateral sulcus, crucially involved in language comprehension. It is the most asymmetrical structure in the brain, much larger (approximately nine millimetres longer, on average) in the linguistically dominant (usually left) than the non-dominant cerebral hemisphere, resulting in a significantly longer left lateral sulcus in the left hemisphere. Also called the temporal plane. \[From Latin planum a flat surface + temporalis of the temple, from tempus, temporis the temple (on the side of the head)]
