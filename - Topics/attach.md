- To make a device available for use by a system. On simple systems this may be achieved by simply engaging the appropriate plug and socket of the interface and putting the device into a state of readiness. In more complex systems it is often necessary to make the operating system aware of the type of device and the address of the connector to which it is attached. It is also necessary to ensure that the operating system has available the appropriate utility program for that device. In some designs the operating system can itself determine the type and address of all the peripherals that are electrically connected. See also INSTALL, PLUG -AND PLAY.
