- $n$. A name given by the Russian neuropsychologist Alexandr Romanovich Luria (1902-77) to a variant of non-fluent aphasia (see aphasia) characterized by almost total failure to initiate speech, and responses to questions that are sparse and laconic and given only after long pauses, but no impairment in ability to name objects, to read, and to repeat sentences.
