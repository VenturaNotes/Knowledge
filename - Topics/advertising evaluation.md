- An attempt to measure the effectiveness of an advertising campaign. Generally this involves an assessment of the communications and sales effects of the advertisement as well as copy testing. This testing can be done before or after an advertisement is broadcast or published. Testing before would include direct rating, portfolio tests, and laboratory tests. Testing after would include recall tests (aided and unaided) as well as recognition tests. With communication and sales effectiveness, clearly the intention is to make consumers aware of and interested in the product, leading to the act of buying and producing satisfaction. It is recognized, however, that some potential buyers are unlikely to follow this course, particularly if the advertising is ineffective and the product does not meet the buyers' needs.
