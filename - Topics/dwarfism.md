- $n$. abnormally short stature from any cause. The most common type is achondroplastic dwarfism (see ACHONDROPLASIA). Pituitary dwarfism results from a deficiency of growth hormone due to a defect in the pituitary gland; people with this type of dwarfism are well proportioned. Primordial dwarfism is due to a genetic defect in the response to growth hormone. Dwarfism may also be associated with thyroid deficiency (see CREtinISM), in which both physical and mental development are arrested; chronic diseases such as rickets; renal failure; and intestinal malabsorption.
