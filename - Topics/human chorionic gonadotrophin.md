- (hCG) a hormone, similar to the pituitary gonadotrophins, that is produced by the placenta during pregnancy. hCG maintains the secretion of progesterone by the corpus luteum of the ovary, the secretion of pituitary gonadotrophins being blocked during pregnancy. Large amounts are excreted in the urine, and this is used as the basis for most pregnancy tests. Serum hCG monitoring is used for tracking early pregnancy and detecting ectopic pregnancies (in which the level will not double over a 48 -hour period, as it does with normal pregnancies). The level of hCG in the serum is also one of the indicators used in prenatal screening tests: levels are higher in pregnancies affected by Down's syndrome in comparison with normal pregnancies (see also PAPP-A; TRIPLE TEST). Levels of hCG are very high in gestational trophoblastic neoplasia. Some malignant tumours (e.g. malignant teratoma, choriocarcinoma, endodermal sinus tumour) secrete hCG, which can be used as a tumor marker. A preparation of hCG is given by injection to treat fertility problems due to ovulation disorders and to induce superovulation in in vitro fertilization.
