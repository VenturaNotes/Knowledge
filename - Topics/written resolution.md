- Under the Companies Act 2006, a resolution signed by a majority of company members and treated as effective even though it is not passed at a properly convened company meeting. A special resolution requires the support of $75 \%$ of members to become effective. Private companies can, in most circumstances, pass resolutions in this way; other companies may have power to do so under their constitutional documents. Under previous legislation, a written resolution required the signature of all members.
