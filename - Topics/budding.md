- (1) (in biology) A method of asexual reproduction in which a new individual is derived from an outgrowth (bud) that becomes detached from the body of the parent. In animals the process is also called gemmation; it is common in cnidarians (e.g. Hydra and stony corals) and also occurs in some sponges and other invertebrates. Among fungi, budding is characteristic of the yeasts. 
- (2) (in horticulture) A method of grafting in which a bud of the scion is inserted onto the stock, usually beneath the bark.
