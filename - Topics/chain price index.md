- A price index that is obtained from the combination of partial indices which refer to the previous time periods and permit the weighting scheme to vary from period to period. Consequently, a comparison of prices between 0 and $t$ is indirectly produced as the product of the subindices for each period, and not directly using data only from periods 0 and $t$. The motivation for allowing the weights to change is to accommodate the continuous introduction of new commodities.
