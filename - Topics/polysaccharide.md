- $n$. a carbohydrate formed from many monosaccharides joined together in long linear or branched chains. Polysaccharides have two important functions: (1) as storage forms of energy; for example glycogen in animals and starch in plants, and (2) as structural elements; for example mucopolysaccharides in animals and cellulose in plants.
## Source[^2]
- (glycan) Any of a group of carbohydrates comprising long chains of monosaccharide (simple sugar) molecules. Homopolysaccharides consist of only one type of monosaccharide; heteropolysaccharides contain two or more different types. Polysaccharides typically consist of several hundred to several thousand monosaccharides joined by glycosidic linkages. They may have molecular weights of up to several million and are often highly branched. Major storage polysaccharides include starch and glycogen, whereas structural polysaccharides include cellulose and chitin.
