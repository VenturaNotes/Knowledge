- ($\boldsymbol{\beta}$-pleated sheet) A form of secondary structure in proteins in which extended polypeptide chains lie parallel to each other and are linked by hydrogen bonds between the $\mathrm{N}-\mathrm{H}$ and $\mathrm{C}=\mathrm{O}$ groups (see illustration). Beta sheets occur in many globular proteins and link polypeptides of the same type in certain fibrous proteins, including fibroin (the protein of silk). Compare ALPHA HELIX.
