- (CBD) An international agreement drawn up by the United Nations Environment Programme for the conservation and sustainable use of the earth's biological resources. It was adopted in 1992, came into force in 1993, and had been adopted by 194 countries by mid-2014. The main objectives are: the conservation of biological diversity; the sustainable use of individual species; and the fair and equitable sharing of the benefits of utilizing the genetic resources of the living world. In 2010 a Strategic Plan for Biodiversity for the period 2011-20 was adopted, centered on the Aichi Biodiversity Targets. These comprise five strategic goals and 20 specific targets for achieving those goals. The principal means of implementing the Convention is the requirement that countries each draw up their own National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP); 190 countries had complied by 2018.
