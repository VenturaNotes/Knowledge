- $n$. A form of transfer of training in which learning or performance of a task is impaired by training on a different but related task, as when a spell of driving on the right-hand side of the road temporarily impairs one's ability to drive on the left, or vice versa. Transfer tends to be negative when the two tasks involve similar stimuli and different responses. See also proactive interference, Retroactive interference. Compare POSITIVE TRANSFER.
