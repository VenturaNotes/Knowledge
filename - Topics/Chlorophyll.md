## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. one of a group of green pigments, found in all green plants and some bacteria, that absorb light to provide energy for the synthesis of carbohydrates from carbon dioxide and water (photosynthesis). The two major chlorophylls, a and b, consist of a porphyrin/magnesium complex.
## Source[^2]
- Any one of a class of pigments found in all photosynthetic organisms; the most important members are chlorophyll $a$ (see formula) and chlorophyll $b$, which occur in all land plants and are responsible for their green colour. Chlorophyll molecules are the principal sites of light absorption in the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis (see PHOTOSYSTEMS I AND II). They are magnesium-containing porphyrins, chemically related to cytochrome and haemoglobin. See also BACTERIOCHLOROPHYLL.
