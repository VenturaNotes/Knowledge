- the number of deaths due to complications of pregnancy, childbirth, and the puerperium per 100,000 live births (see also STILLBIRTH). In 1952 concern about maternal mortality resulted in Britain in the setting up of a triennial confidential enquiry into every such death to identify any shortfall in resources or care. The first triennial report was published in 1985. Since 2014 reports have been produced annually by MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies: Reducing Risk through Audits and Confidential Enquiries Across the UK). Levels of maternal deaths are currently low: a report published in 2017 (covering 2013-15) counted 202 obstetric-related deaths (8.76 per 100,000 live births). Thromboembolism was the commonest direct cause of death (30 deaths, 1.13 per 100,000 live births), while heart disease was the commonest indirect cause of death (54 deaths, 2.34 per 100,000 live births).
