- A fleshy fruit formed from either one carpel or from several fused together and containing many seeds. The fruit wall may have two or three layers but the inner layer is never hard and stony (as in some drupes). Examples of berries are grapes and tomatoes. A berry, such as a cucumber, that develops a hard outer rind is called a pepo. One that is segmented and has a leathery rind, such as a citrus fruit, is called a hesperidium. The rind contains oil glands and is lined by the white mesocarp, commonly called pith.
