## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a bundle of conducting nerve fibers (see illustration) that transmit impulses from the brain or spinal cord to the muscles and glands (motor nerves) or inwards from the sense organs to the brain and spinal cord (sensory nerves). Most large nerves are mixed nerves, containing both motor and sensory nerve fibres running to and from a particular region of the body.

## Source[^2]
- A strand of tissue comprising many nerve fibers plus supporting tissues (see GLIA), enclosed in a connective-tissue sheath. Nerves connect the central nervous system with the organs and tissues of the body. A nerve may carry only motor nerve fibers (motor nerve) or only sensory fibers (sensory nerve) or it may be mixed and carry both types (mixed nerve). Although the nerve fibers are in close proximity within the nerve, their physiological responses are independent of each other.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A cordlike band of axon fibers that transmits impulses of sensation (if it is an afferent nerve) or movement (if it is an efferent nerve) between a sensory receptor and the central nervous system, or between the central nervous system and a muscle or gland. It is often confused with a neuron, which has a soma and only one axon. See cranial nerve, spinal nerve. \[From Latin nervus a nerve, from Greek neuron a nerve]
