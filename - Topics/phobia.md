- $n$. a pathologically strong fear of a particular event or thing. Avoiding the feared situation may severely restrict one's life and cause much suffering. The main kinds of phobia are specific phobias (isolated fears of particular things, such as sharp knives), agoraphobia, claustrophobia, social phobias of encountering people, and animal phobias, as of spiders, rats, or dogs (see also PREPAREDNESS). Treatment is with cognitive behavioural therapy, desensitization, graded selfexposure, or flooding. Antidepressants are also useful.
