## Source [^1]
- $n$. a special kind of blood protein that is synthesized in lymphoid tissue in response to the presence of a particular antigen and circulates in the plasma to attack the antigen and render it harmless. The production of specific antibodies against antigens as diverse as invading bacteria, inhaled pollen grains, and foreign red blood cells is the basis of both immunity and allergy. Chemically, antibodies are proteins of the globulin type; they are classified according to their structure and function (see IMMUNOGLOBULIN).
