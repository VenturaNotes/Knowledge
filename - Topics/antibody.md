## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a special kind of blood protein that is synthesized in lymphoid tissue in response to the presence of a particular antigen and circulates in the plasma to attack the antigen and render it harmless. The production of specific antibodies against antigens as diverse as invading bacteria, inhaled pollen grains, and foreign red blood cells is the basis of both immunity and allergy. Chemically, antibodies are proteins of the globulin type; they are classified according to their structure and function (see IMMUNOGLOBULIN).
## Source[^2]
- A protein (see IMMUNOGLOBULIN) produced by certain white blood cells (plasma cells) in response to entry into the body of a foreign substance (antigen) in order to render it harmless. An antibody-antigen reaction is highly specific. Antibody production is one aspect of the immune response and is stimulated by such antigens as invading bacteria, foreign red blood cells (see abo SYSTEM), inhaled pollen grains or dust, and foreign tissue grafts. Specific monoclonal antibodies are now used in various types of immunoassay. See also B CELL; IMMUNITY.
