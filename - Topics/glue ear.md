- a common condition in which viscous fluid accumulates in the middle ear, causing deafness. It is most frequently seen in children and is due to malfunction of the Eustachian tube. Many cases resolve spontaneously; treatment, if required, consists of surgical incision of the eardrum (myringotomy), drainage of the fluid, and the insertion of a grommet. Alternatively, hearing aids may be used until spontaneous resolution occurs. Medical names: otitis media with effusion, secretory otitis media.
