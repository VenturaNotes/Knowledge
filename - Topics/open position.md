- (naked position) A trading position in which a dealer has commodities, securities, or currencies bought but unsold or unhedged (see HEDGE), or sales that are neither covered nor hedged. In either case the dealer is vulnerable to market fluctuations until the position is closed or hedged.
## Source[^2]
- A situation when a trader in securities, commodities, or currencies is at risk if market prices rise or fall. This may involve selling for future delivery items not either held or hedged by contracts to buy, in which case the trader will make a loss if market prices rise, or contracting to buy without hedging by contracts to sell, in which case the trader will make a loss if market prices fall. An open position is contrasted with covered arbitrage, where contracts are balanced and the trader is not exposed to risk of loss through price changes.
