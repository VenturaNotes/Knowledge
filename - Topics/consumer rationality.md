- (1) Making choices on the basis of preferences. In this sense a consumer is rational if he always chooses the feasible alternative that he most prefers. The choice of an alternative that is not the best is irrational.
- (2) Possessing preferences that satisfy a set of axioms. Let $\succsim$ represent the statement 'at least as good as'. The standard axioms of consumer theory for choice under certainty are: 
	- (1) Completeness: for any two alternatives $x$ and $y$ either $x \succsim y$ or $y \succsim x$; 
	- (2) Reflexivity: $x \succsim x$ for any alternative $x$; 
	- (3) Transitivity: for any three alternatives $x, y$, and $z$, if $x \succsim y$ and $y \succsim z$ then $x \succsim$ $z$. 
	- If a consumer's preferences satisfy these axioms he can be described as rational. This is not the only set of possible axioms, so 'rationality' in this sense is not uniquely defined.
