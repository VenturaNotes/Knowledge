- The ratio between proportional change in quantity demanded and proportional change in price. Counter to the general definition of elasticity, it is common to insert a minus sign in the definition, so where $q$ is quantity and $p$ is price, elasticity of demand is given by $$\varepsilon_{d}=-\left(\frac{d q}{q}\right) /\left(\frac{d p}{p}\right)=-\left(\frac{p}{q}\right)\left(\frac{d q}{d p}\right)$$The minus makes the elasticity of demand positive, to avoid confusion when discussing larger or smaller elasticities. If demand is elastic, $\varepsilon_{d}>1$; the proportional rise in quantity is more than a proportional cut in price, so total spent rises as price falls. This is contrasted with inelastic demand, where $\varepsilon_{d}<1$, so total spent falls as price falls. See also CROSS-PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND; INCOME ELASTICITY OF DEMAND.
