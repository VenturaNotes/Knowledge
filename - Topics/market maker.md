- (1) Any intermediary who creates a market for a financial obligation. 
- (2) A dealer in securities on the London Stock Exchange who undertakes to buy and sell securities as a principal and is therefore obliged to announce buying and selling prices for a particular security at a particular time. Before October 1986 (see BIG BANG) this function was performed by a stockjobber, who was then obliged to deal with the public through a stockbroker. Since that date market makers have combined dealing in securities as principals with acting as agents, working for a commission. While this dual role may create a conflict of interest for market makers (see Chinese wall; front running), it avoids the restrictive trade practice of the former system and reduces the cost of dealing in the market.
