- Pronounced "dot net framework"
- An open source platform consisting of 
	- An open source platform consisting of
		- code compilers
			- #question How does a .net framework have a code compiler? 
		- libraries
		- support programs
		- advanced programming interfaces (APIs)
			- #question Isn't it supposed to be application programming interface?
			- #question What makes it advanced? 
- Usage
	- Develop Windows-based applications
		- #question Can .Net framework be used for something else than Windows-based applications?
- Benefits
	- Reduce programming errors
	- Increase productivity levels of software development teams
		- By adopting a modular approach to software design which can accommodate object code regardless of its storage or execution method 
			- #question What does a modular approach look like? 
			- #question What is meant by object code here?
### Source[^2]
- .NET Framework is a software development platform comprising the Common Language Runtime (CLR) and .NET class libraries installed on windows systems
	- #question What is Common language runtime?
	- #question What are .Net class libraries?
- Developers interact with this framework via IDEs like Visual Studio, writing code in languages like C# or VB.NET that run on the CLR
	- #question What is meant by "running on the CLR"?
	- #question What is VB.NET?
- A .Net framework is primarily used for creating windows-based applications
- A key architectural feature of the .Net framework is the modular software design
- Network hardware drivers are typically not included in .Net frameworks
	- Compliers, APIs and Libraries are typically included
- The .Net framework was designed to be modular to reduce programming errors and enhance developer productivity.

### Source[^3]
- The .Net framework is primarily described as an open source platform with compilers, libraries, and APIs
- The design goal of the .Net framework is to reduce programming errors and increase productivity
- The .Net framework adopts a modular approach
- The .Net framework can accommodate object code regardless of its storage or execution
- .Net framework is bade for windows-based applications
- The .NET Framework's ability to accommodate object code regardless of its storage or execution method is most directly facilitated by the common language infrastructure (CLI) specification and its implementation, the Common Language Runtime(CLR)
- While the text does state that the .Net framework is an open source platform, it's important to differentiate between the original .NET Framework's licensing (primarily source-available or shared source) and the fully open-source nature of .NET core and subsequent .NET (5+) versions
	- #question What are these other 2 versions?
- The "modular approach to software design" in .NET is critically dependent on the concept of assemblies. Which statement best describes the role and characteristics of an assembly in .NET?
	- An assembly is the fundamental unit of deployment, versioning, security, and type resolution, containing CIL code and metadata.
	- #question What does an assembly look like?
- [[Common language runtime]] (CLR) provides numerous services. Which is least likely to be a direct, core service managed by the CLR itself during program execution?
	- Source code parsing and abstract syntax tree generation
		- #question What is source code parsing?
		- #question What is abstract syntax tree generation?
		- #question What is CLR?
