## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Any organism that uses energy derived from sunlight and relies on organic compounds in its environment as a source of carbon, instead of carbon dioxide, to manufacture its own organic compounds. For example, certain photosynthetic purple nonsulphur bacteria can use fatty acids, alcohols, carbohydrates, and other compounds as a carbon source in light conditions, while producing their ATP by photophosphorylation. See PHOTOTROPH.
