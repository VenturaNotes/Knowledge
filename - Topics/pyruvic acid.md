## Source [^1]
- (pyruvate) a compound, derived from carbohydrates, that may be oxidized via a complex series of reactions in the Krebs cycle to yield carbon dioxide and energy in the form of ATP.
## Source[^2]
- (2-oxopropanoic acid) A colorless liquid organic acid, $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCOOH}$. Pyruvate is an important intermediate compound in metabolism, being produced during glycolysis and converted to acetyl coenzyme A, required for the Krebs cycle. Under anaerobic conditions it is converted to lactate or ethanol see FERMENTATION.
