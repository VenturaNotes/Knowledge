- $n$. An illusory light or dark strip along the edge of a blurred contour between light and dark areas of an image, the strip on the light side being lighter than the light area of the image and the strip on the dark side darker than the dark area, familiar examples being the light and dark strips that can be seen at the outer and inner edges, respectively, of a blurred shadow cast by the sun or by a table lamp. Such bands have been incorporated deliberately into paintings by artists such as the French neoimpressionist and pointillist Georges Seurat (1859-91), and the phenomenon is called irradiation in the literature of art criticism. See also Craik-O'Brien effect. \[Named after the Austrian physicist, philosopher, and psychologist Ernst Mach (1838-1916) who first drew attention to the phenomenon in 1865]
