- A document signed by the mate of a ship as proof that the goods specified in the document have been loaded onto his ship, especially if they have been delivered direct to the ship, rather than from a quayside warehouse. The mate's receipt functions as a document of title, which may be required as proof of loading in a Free On Board (FOB) contract, pending the issue of the bill of lading.
