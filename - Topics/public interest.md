- The good of the general public, as contrasted with the particular individuals or firms involved in a decision. The instructions for managers of publicly owned enterprises, or bodies appointed to regulate monopolies, often contain phrases such as 'operate in the public interest'. In the absence of any objective method of determining what the public interest is, those given such instructions must necessarily use their own judgement, or rely on precedents set by similar bodies.
