- A small file placed on a user’s hard disk by a server, containing details about the user’s use of the website. It is returned to the server whenever the browser accesses the site.

For example, if the user is buying a number of items on-line, then a cookie is necessary for the server to keep track of items from different pages placed in a ‘shopping cart’.
