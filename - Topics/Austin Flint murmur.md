- a heart murmur that is loudest in diastole and associated with a third heart sound. It is a sign of aortic regurgitation, which allows retrograde filling and rapid rise in left intraventricular pressure. This prevents the mitral valve from opening fully, giving rise to the murmur, which is best heard in the mitral area (apex) rather than the aortic area (where the problem lies). \[Austin Flint (1812-86), US physician]
