- Any membrane that is found in a living cell, especially the plasma membrane, which forms the cell boundary. Other cell membranes include the nuclear envelope; the tonoplast, which encloses the vacuole of plant cells; and the membranes of the various cell organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, mitochondria, chloroplasts, and lysosomes.

- $n$. A double layer of amphipathic lipid molecules (a lipid bilayer), plus various protein molecules, punctured by tiny pores approximately 60 nanometres (billionths of a metre) in diameter, forming a semipermeable membrane that segregates the fluid inside a cell from the fluid outside it and maintains the structural integrity of the cell. Molecules smaller than the pores can cross the membrane by passive diffusion; larger molecules that are lipid soluble can dissolve in the membrane and cross it by diffusion; and larger molecules that are not lipid soluble can cross the membrane only by active transport. Also called a plasma membrane . See also osmosis, SODIUM PUMP. \[From Latin membrana a thin skin]
