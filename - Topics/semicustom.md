## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A technique used for the design of integrated circuits that is based on the use of fully characterized libraries of circuit elements produced by the manufacturer of the device. The designer is therefore not concerned with low-level details of semiconductor material electrical properties, and can instead concentrate on the functional behavior of the design. Most ASIC circuit designs (for instance gate arrays) are produced by this method. See also FULL CUSTOM.
