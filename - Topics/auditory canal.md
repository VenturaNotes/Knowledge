- $n$. Either of two passages in each ear, the external auditory canal (also called the external meatus) leading from the outer ear to the tympanic membrane, and the internal auditory canal (also called the internal meatus) located in the temporal bone and containing the vestibulocochlear nerve that transmits impulses from the inner ear to the brain. When unspecified, the external canal is usually meant, but such ambiguity is avoided in careful usage. Compare Eustachian tube.
