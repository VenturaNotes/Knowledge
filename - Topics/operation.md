## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An operation on a set S is a rule that associates with some number $n$ of elements of $S$ a resulting element in $S$. If $n = 1, 2, 3,$ the operation is respectively called unary, binary, ternary and more generally is referred to as $n$-ary 

## Source[^2]
- (1) A function from $S^{m}$ (see Cartesian Product) into $S$ itself, where $S$ is some set specific to the function. Such a function is usually referred to as an $m$-ary or $m$-adic operation over $S, m$ being some natural number, sometimes referred to as the arity of the operation. The most common operations are the dyadic (or binary) operations that map $S \times S$ into $S$ and the monadic (or unary) operations that map $S$ into $S$. The case where the arity is zero gives the so-called [[nullary operation|nullary operations]], which correspond simply to elements of $S$. There is also a more general kind of operation that involves more than one set. For example, in a finite-state automaton the next state depends on the current input symbol and the current state, and is thus given by a dyadic operation from $I \times Q$ into $Q$, where $I$ is the set of input symbols and $Q$ the set of states. See also LOGIC OPERATION, ARITHMETIC OPERATION, OPERATIONS ON SETS. 
- (2) Another name for instruction (in a computer), as designated by an operation code. 
- (3) (in a programming language) Whatever is carried out by an operator (def. 2), or, more generally, anything that can take place within a program: a declaration, an assignment statement, a selection, a loop, the call of a function, and so on.
