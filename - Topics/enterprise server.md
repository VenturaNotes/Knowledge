- (1) A server intended to provide service to an entire organization rather than to a selected subset of the organization. It is most likely to be the system maintaining a corporate database, where there are high levels of interaction between the separate entries in the database, and between the separate uses made of the database by the individual members of the organization. The enterprise server may be a server in a client/server environment. 
- (2) Informal name for mainframe.
