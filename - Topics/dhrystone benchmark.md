## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A program designed to be used to compare the performance of compilers for a particular high-level language (especially for Ada). The program does not compute anything useful, but it is syntactically and semantically correct. The distribution of statements is approximately 53% assignments, 32% control, and 15% procedure or function calls. This mix is considered to be representative of typical use when a high-level language is used for real programs. (The name derives as a contrast with whetstone benchmark.)
