- a breach in the lining (mucosa) of the digestive tract caused by the actions of gastric acid and pepsin. This may occur due to abnormally high levels of gastric acid or pepsin or when the mucosa has been damaged by chronic Helicobacter pylori infection or by aspirin or NSAID use. A peptic ulcer may be found in the oesophagus (oesophageal ulcer, associated with reflux oesophagitis); the stomach (see GASTRIC ULCER); duodenum (see DUODENAL ULCER); jejunum (jejunal ulcer, usually in the Zollinger-Ellison syndrome); in a Meckel's diverticulum; and close to a gastroenterostomy (stomal ulcer, anastomotic ulcer, marginal ulcer).
