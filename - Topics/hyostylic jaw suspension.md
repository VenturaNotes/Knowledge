- A type of jaw suspension seen in most fishes, in which the upper jaw is not directly connected to the cranium. The attachment between cranium and upper jaw is made by a ligament at the front end and by the hyomandibular (see HYoid ARCH) at the rear end (see illustration). Compare AMPHISTYLIC JAW SUSPENSION; AUTOSTYLIC JAW SUSPENSION.
