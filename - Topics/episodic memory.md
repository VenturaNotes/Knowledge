- $n$. A type of long-term memory for personal experiences and events, such as being stung by a bee many years ago, getting married a few months ago, reading a particular book yesterday, or having an egg for breakfast a few minutes ago. Such knowledge is characteristically stored as information about specific experiences and events occurring at particular times and places, and it affords a sense of personal continuity and familiarity with the past. It accounts for only a small proportion of human memory, most of our memories having no basis in personal experience. The concept was introduced in 1972 by the Estonian-born Canadian psychologist Endel Tulving (born 1927), who distinguished it from semantic memory and from procedural memory. Also called autobiographical memory. See also autonoetic, ePISODIC buffer, HYPERTHYMESIA, MENTAL TIME TRAVEL. Compare EPISODIC AMNESIA. \[So called because it relates to episodes in one's life]
