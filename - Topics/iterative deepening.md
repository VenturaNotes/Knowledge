- A technique used to enhance depth-first search. The search tree is first processed to a maximum depth of two, and then the whole process is repeated to a depth of three, then again to four, and so on to the maximum depth $n$. Surprisingly, this costs little more than a single search to depth $n$ (due to the exponential growth rate of the branching factor) and guarantees to find a shortest path to the solution.
