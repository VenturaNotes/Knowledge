- An obsolete type of serial impact printer formerly widely used on word-processor systems for producing letters and documents. The font was formed on the end of spring fingers extending radially from a central hub. The print head and paper position could generally be incremented bidirectionally by control commands, making possible proportional spacing, justification, subscript and superscript characters, etc.
- The daisywheel printer was introduced by Diablo Systems Inc. in 1972 and represented a considerable improvement in speed and reduction in mechanical complexity compared to other typewriters then used as low-speed printers. By 1990, however, daisywheel printers had been superseded by faster, more flexible, and quieter dot matrix printers and page printers.
