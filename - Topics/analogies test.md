- $n$. A type of intelligence test item requiring logical thinking, usually presented in the form $A$ is to $B$ as $C$ is to..., sometimes followed by a number of alternatives from which a selection must be made, the right answer in this example being $D$. Another easy example is Bird is to air as fish is to..., the right answer being water. A typical hard example with response alternatives is: $C$ is to $X$ as $F$ is to...( $M, U, L, V$, or $H$). Although arguments could be developed to justify various answers, the 'right' answer to this item is $U$, because $C$ and $X$ are three letters from either end of the alphabet, and $F$ and $U$ are six letters from either end.
