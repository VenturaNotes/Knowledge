- Gopher: A protocol and supporting utilities formerly popular on the Internet. Gopher presented the user with a hierarchy of nodes, each of which was either a menu (a directory of material accessible at this point), a search node (a set of documents that could be searched using keywords), or a leaf node (a document containing text or other forms of material that the workstation could display). Its use declined because of the World Wide Web's greater flexibility.
