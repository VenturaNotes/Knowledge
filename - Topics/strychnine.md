- $n$. a poisonous alkaloid produced in the seeds of the East Indian tree Strychnos nux-vomica. In small doses it was formerly widely used in 'tonics'. Poisoning causes painful muscular spasms similar to those of tetanus; the back becomes arched (the posture known as opisthotonos) and death is likely to occur from spasm in the respiratory muscles.
