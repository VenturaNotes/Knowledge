- A composite material made up of two or more types of polymer (see Feature entry). As with other composite materials, composite polymers can have more useful properties than any of the individual polymers that make them up. Composite polymers can be constructed in many forms, including layers, films, and networks. They are sometimes called polymer alloys.
