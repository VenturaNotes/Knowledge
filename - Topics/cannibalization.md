- When one part of a company grows by taking sales from another part of the same company. An example would be a supermarket chain that opens a new store which takes some sales from an existing store in the same chain.
## Source[^2]
- A market situation in which increased sales of one brand results in decreased sales of another brand within the same product line, usually because there is little differentiation between them. For instance, two drinks marketed by the same manufacturer and packaged in almost the same color could cause increased sales of one to be achieved at the expense of decreased sales of the other.
