## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A term applied to a set $S$ on whose elements a dyadic operation ${ }^{\circ}$ is defined and that possesses the property that, for every $(s, t)$ in $S$, the quantity $s^{\circ} t$ is also in $S ; S$ is then said to be closed under ${ }^{\circ}$. A similar definition holds for monadic operations such as $\sim$. A set $S$ is closed under $\sim$ provided that, when $s$ is in $S$, the quantity $\sim s$ is also in $S$.
- The set of integers is closed under the usual arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication, but is not closed under division.
