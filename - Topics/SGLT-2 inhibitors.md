- a class of oral hypoglycaemic drugs for use in the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Sodium/glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) plays the largest role in glucose reabsorption in the kidney. Inhibition of SGLT-2 leads to an increase in the loss of glucose in the urine, a reduction in blood glucose levels, and a modest degree of weight loss over time due to the increased calorie loss. Two drugs in this class are currently licensed for use in the UK: dapagliflozin (Forxiga) and canagliflozin (Invokana).
