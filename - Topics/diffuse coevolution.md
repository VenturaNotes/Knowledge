- (guild coevolution) The evolution in several species of similar traits in response to a set of selection pressures imposed by one or more interacting species. For example, shrubby plant species commonly evolve similar structures such as thorns and unpalatable leaves to protect against grazing herbivores of various species. Also, flowers of different species often have similar features to attract particular pollinating animals, such as bees.
