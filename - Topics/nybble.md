- $n$. A measure of information (2) equivalent to four bits. It suffices to represent a decimal digit. Also spelt nibble, though this is avoided in careful usage and is to be deprecated, because it obscures the pleasing analogy with byte. Compare вуte. \[An arbitrary formation based on nibble, alluding to the fact that it is half a byte]
