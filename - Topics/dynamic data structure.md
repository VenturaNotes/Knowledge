- A data structure whose organizational characteristics may change during its lifetime. The adaptability afforded by such structures, e.g. linked lists, is often at the expense of decreased efficiency in accessing elements of the structure. Two main features distinguish dynamic structures from static data structures. Firstly, it is no longer possible to infer all structural information from a header; each data element will have to contain information relating it logically to other elements of the structure.
- Secondly, using a single block of contiguous storage is often not appropriate, and hence it is necessary to provide some storage management scheme at run-time.
