- A dedicated communication path is established between two endpoints before data transmission begins
	- Example: Traditional telephone networks

## Source[^2]
- A method of communications that is used in telephone systems and requires a physical transmission pathâ€”a circuit-to exist between the two devices wishing to communicate. The end-to-end path must exist before data can be sent. The only delay to which the data is subject is the propagation delay along the transmission medium ( 6 microseconds per 100 km for copper telephone lines). Since the path is reserved during the entire connection, any unused bandwidth is wasted. Compare MESSAGE SWITCHING, PACKET SWITCHING, VIRTUAL CIRCUIT.
## Source[^3]
- Circuit switching is a type of technology used for data transfer. In circuit switching, at least two network nodes establish and maintain a temporary direct connection. Circuit switching uses the dedicated communications channel, or circuit, for the duration of the connection to exchange information. Also referred to as a connection-oriented network, circuit switching is the basis of traditional telephone networks.
