- A hybrid vector, used in gene cloning, that includes the cos gene (from the lambda bacteriophage). It also contains drug resistance marker genes and other plasmid genes. Cosmids can incorporate larger DNA fragments than either phage or plasmid vectors alone, typically $35-45~ \mathrm{kbp}$, and are especially suitable for cloning large mammalian genes or multigene fragments.
