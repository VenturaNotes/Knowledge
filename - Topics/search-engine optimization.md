- (SEO) Designing a website in such a way that its pages achieve the highest possible rank in the listings of Internet search engines, thereby generating greater traffic to the site. This generally involves using keywords and tags that are known to rank highly with searchengine algorithms as well as increasing the internal and external links on the site. SEO methods are often divided into so-called white hat techniques, which make use of legitimate and overt means, and black hat tactics, which rely on hidden coding. See PageRank.
