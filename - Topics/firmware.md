## Source[^2]
- Computer programs or data that are stored in a memory chip. These are often built into a computer to make it unnecessary to load the programs or data from disk or from the keyboard. Word-processing programs, for example, on read-only memory (ROM) chips are built into some business computer systems. Firmware is also used where absolute reliability is required, for example in air-traffic control.
