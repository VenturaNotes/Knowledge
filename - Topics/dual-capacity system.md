- A system of trading on a stock exchange in which the functions of stockjobber and stockbroker are carried out by separate firms. In a single-capacity system the two functions can be combined by firms known as market makers. Dual capacity existed on the London Stock Exchange prior to October 1986 (see Big Bang), when a single-capacity system was introduced.
