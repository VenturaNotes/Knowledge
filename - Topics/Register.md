- A register, also referred to as a processor register or CPU register, is a small memory storage area that is built into a computer’s central processing unit (CPU). A processor register temporarily stores storage addresses, instructions, and other types of computer data for a system’s CPU. This allows the CPU to quickly retrieve data and execute computer instructions, which improves the response speed of a computer system.
