- Process analytical technology (PAT) is a system that analyzes and controls manufacturing processes. It measures critical quality parameters such as variables that can impact production, and the performance of raw and in-process materials within a production facility. PAT assesses the quality of product batchesÂ during the manufacturing process, thereby reducing the need for product testing. It measures process materials' performance by acquiring and analyzing manufacturing data.
