- A minimal level of unemployment that will occur in even the most efficient economy. Frictional unemployment exists because of lags between workers leaving one job and taking up another and because there are times of the year when many new workers (such as school and college leavers) enter the labour market; in these circumstances there is some delay in finding them all jobs.
## Source[^2]
- The unemployment that occurs because, as people change jobs when some sectors of the economy grow and others contract, it is not practicable to dovetail precisely leaving old jobs and starting new ones. At times of fairly full employment, frictional unemployment may form an appreciable fraction of total unemployment.
