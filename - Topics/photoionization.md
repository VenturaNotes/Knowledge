- The ionization of an atom or molecule as a result of irradiation by electromagnetic radiation. For a photoionization to occur the incident photon of the radiation must have an energy in excess of the ionization potential of the species being irradiated. The ejected photoelectron will have an energy, $E$, given by $E = hf – I$, where $h$ is the Planck constant, $f$ is the frequency of the incident radiation, and $I$ is the ionization potential of the irradiated species.
