- (ovarian follicle) The fluid-filled cavity that surrounds and protects the developing egg cell (oocyte) in the ovary of a mammal. The oocyte is surrounded by granulosa cells, which secrete hormones that regulate development of the follicle. After the release of the ovum the follicle develops into a corpus luteum. It is named after the Dutch anatomist Reinier de Graaf (1641-73).
