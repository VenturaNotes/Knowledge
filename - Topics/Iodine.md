## Source [^1]
- This is a diatomic element: $I_2$ 
## Source[^2]
- $n$. an element required in small amounts for healthy growth and development. An adult body contains about 30 mg of iodine, mostly concentrated in the thyroid gland: this gland requires iodine to synthesize thyroid hormones. A deficiency of iodine in adults leads to goitre and in a fetus leads to cretinism. The RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is $140 ~\mu \mathrm{g} /\text{day}$; dietary sources include seafood, vegetables grown in soil containing iodide, and iodized table salt. Iodine is used in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases of the thyroid gland (see Lugol's SOLUTION; RADIOACTIVE IODINE THERAPY) and also as an antiseptic and skin disinfectant (in the form of povidone-iodine). Water-soluble contrast media used in X-ray examinations are organic chemicals containing iodine, which is radiopaque due to its high atomic weight. Symbol: I.
## Source[^3]
- Symbol I. A dark violet nonmetallic element that is required as a trace element (see ESSENTIAL ELEMENT) by living organisms; in animals it is concentrated in the thyroid gland as a constituent of thyroid hormones. Deficiency causes disruption of thyroid function, with low levels of circulating thyroid hormones leading to enlargement of the thyroid gland (goitre). Seafood and iodized salt are good sources of iodine in areas where the soil, and hence food crops, have low levels of the element.
