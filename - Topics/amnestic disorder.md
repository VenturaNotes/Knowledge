- $n$. A mental disorder characterized by a significant decline in the capacity to learn and recall new information, and often also a decline in the recall of previously learnt information or experiences, leading to impairment in social or occupational functioning, the symptoms not occurring exclusively during delirium or dementia. The disorder may result from a general medical condition, including head injury, medication, or exposure to a toxin, and there is a variant form of substance-induced persisting amnestic disorder often caused by a deficiency of vitamins (especially thiamine) following prolonged alcohol misuse. Also called amnesic syndrome. See also cognitive disorders. \[From Greek amnestos forgetting, from $a$ - not + mnasthai to remember]
