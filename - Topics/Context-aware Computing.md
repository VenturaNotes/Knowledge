- Context-aware computing is a manner of operation that relies on situational and environmental data to anticipate the functions a user will engage with on wearable and mobile devices. By having access to this information, the system can intelligently offer experiences based on data analysis to suggest related functions, graphics, or other information that will enhance the overall user experience. This computing style includes actions like automatically rotating the screen based on how the device is positioned.
