- $n$. In psychometrics, any scale designed to control for potential sources of bias by counterbalancing (2); especially a questionnaire that controls for acquiescence response set by ensuring that half the items are keyed positively, affirmative answers increasing a respondent's score on the attribute being measured, and half the items are scored negatively, negative answers increasing the score, the net effect being that scores on the test are not biased systematically in either direction by acquiescence.
