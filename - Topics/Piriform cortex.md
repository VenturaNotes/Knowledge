- $n$. An area in the anterior temporal lobe of each cerebral hemisphere forming part of the olfactory cortex, receiving nerve impulses from the olfactory receptors via the olfactory bulb without the prior involvement of the thalamus as in other sensory systems. It is not part of the neocortex but is a three-layered palaeocortex. Also spelt pyriform cortex, an etymologically incorrect but common form. \[From Latin pirum a pear + forma a form or shape]
