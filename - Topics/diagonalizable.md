- (diagonalization) A square matrix is diagonalizable if it is similar to a diagonal matrix; that is, a square matrix A is diagonalizable if there exists an invertible matrix P such that $P^{-1}AP = D$ is diagonal. Equivalently A has an eigenbasis (which then forms the columns of $P$). A real matrix is diagonalizable if the roots of the characteristic equation are real and distinct, though the converse is not true (e.g. the identity matrix is diagonal). Generally a real matrix is diagonalizable if the roots of the characteristic equation are real and for each eigenvalue its algebraic multiplicity equals its geometric multiplicity. If $P^{-1}AP = D$, then $A^n = PD^nP^{-1}$ and so powers of diagonalizable matrices can be easily calculated.
- As examples $$\begin{gather} A=\begin{bmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix},B= \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0 \end{bmatrix}, \\C = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1\end{bmatrix}. \end{gather}$$
- A is diagonalizable as it has distinct real eigenvalues (1 and 2); B is not diagonalizable as a real matrix as its characteristic polynomial $x^2 + 1$ has no real roots, but $B$ is diagonalizable as a complex matrix as $x^2 + 1$ has distinct complex roots; $C$ is not diagonalizable as the only eigenvalue 1 has algebraic multiplicity 2 and geometric multiplicity 1.
- A linear map of a finite-dimensional vector space is diagonalizable if any matrix representing it is diagonalizable. See also MINIMAL POLYNOMIAL, SPECTRAL THEOREM, TRIANGULARIZABLE.
