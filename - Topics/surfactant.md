- $n$. a wetting agent. Surfactants can be added to materials used in dentistry to reduce surface tension and so improve flow. Pulmonary surfactant, secreted by type II pneumocytes, is a complex mixture of compounds (including lipids, protein, and carbohydrates) that prevents the air sacs (alveoli) of the lungs from collapsing by reducing surface tension. In its absence, as in the immature lungs of premature babies, atelectasis and respiratory distress syndrome will develop.
## Source[^2]
- (surface active agent) A substance, such as a detergent, added to a liquid to increase its spreading or wetting properties by reducing its surface tension.
