- $n$. a philosophical concept designed to determine which individuals have human rights and responsibilities. Personhood may be distinguished by possession of defining characteristics, such as consciousness and rationality, or in terms of relationships with others. Philosophers disagree on whether all humans are, or all nonhuman animals are not, persons, especially when debating the ethics of abortion, euthanasia, and human uses of animals. In law, corporations can be regarded as having personhood, when identifying their rights and responsibilities.
