- Database design is the process of creating organized data sets into a useable model. The database management professional must follow a set of guidelines to classify and sort the data. There are different models that a company can base its design on, and the model type will define the way that the data is categorized. Typically, these include models like object-oriented, hierarchical, entity-attribute-value, or star schema. There are three phases to the design process: conceptual, logical and physical design.
