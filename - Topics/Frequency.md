- The number of complete cycles of a periodically variable quantity, such as a pulse or wave, that occurs in unit time. It is measured in hertz.

- In simple terms, frequency is the rate at which something occurs over a period of time. In relation to a central processing unit (CPU), frequency refers to a computer processorâ€™s operational clock cycles per second. The standard unit of frequency is Hertz (Hz). If an oscillating or varying electrical current completes one full cycle per second, the frequency is recorded as 1Hz.

- (1) The number of times the average person in a target market is exposed to an advertising message during a given period. 
- (2) The number of times an advertisement is repeated in a given medium (television, radio, etc.) within a given period, usually a month. 
- (3) In statistics, a measurement of the likelihood of a particular event occurring.

- $n$. (of urine) the passage of urine more than six or seven times a day: a lower urinary tract symptom that usually indicates genitourinary disorders and diseases but also accompanies polyuria.

- $n$. 
- (1) The number of times that an event occurs in a specified time period; more specifically the number of times that a wave repeats itself in one second, generally expressed in hertz (Hz) or cycles per second. Frequency $(f)$ is equivalent to the velocity of propagation $(v)$ divided by wavelength $(\lambda): f=v / \lambda$. The audibility range of sound waves extends from about 16 Hz at the low end to about $20,000 \mathrm{~Hz}$ at the high end for a person with normal hearing, and the visible spectrum of light from about 405,405 billion Hz at the red end to about 769,231 billion Hz at the violet end. See also spatial frequency. 
- (2) In statistics and measurement theory, the number of items or scores falling into a particular class. Frequency data are scores representing counts rather than other kinds of measurements.
