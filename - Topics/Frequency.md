- The number of complete cycles of a periodically variable quantity, such as a pulse or wave, that occurs in unit time. It is measured in hertz.

- In simple terms, frequency is the rate at which something occurs over a period of time. In relation to a central processing unit (CPU), frequency refers to a computer processorâ€™s operational clock cycles per second. The standard unit of frequency is Hertz (Hz). If an oscillating or varying electrical current completes one full cycle per second, the frequency is recorded as 1Hz.
