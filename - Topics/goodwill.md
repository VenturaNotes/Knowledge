- An intangible asset reflecting a business's customer connections, reputation, and similar factors. It can be valued as the difference between the value of the separable net assets of a business and the total value of the business. Purchased goodwill is the difference between the fair value of the price paid for a business and the aggregate of the fair values of its separable net assets. It is generally recognized as an intangible asset in the balance sheet and written off by amortization to the profit and loss account over its useful economic life (which is assumed to be no more than five years if it cannot be realistically estimated). Internally generated goodwill should not be recognized in the financial statements of an organization. The treatment of goodwill is now governed by Section 19 of the Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. The relevant International Accounting Standards are IAS22, Business Combinations; IAS36, Impairment of Assets; and IAS38, Intangible Assets.

- An intangible asset, representing the fact that a business as a going concern is worth more than its tangible assets. This is usually due to the accumulated know-how and trade contacts of its staff. Goodwill is not normally included as an asset in balance sheets, but is listed if a company has taken over another business for more than the value of its tangible assets. It is then required to be written off over a period.
