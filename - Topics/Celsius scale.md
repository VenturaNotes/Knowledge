- A temperature scale in which the fixed points are the temperatures at standard pressure of ice in equilibrium with water $\left(0^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ and water in equilibrium with steam $\left(100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. The scale, between these two temperatures, is divided in 100 degrees. The degree Celsius $\left({ }^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ is equal in magnitude to the kelvin. This scale was formerly known as the centigrade scale; the name was officially changed in 1948 to avoid confusion with a hundredth part of a grade. It is named after the Swedish astronomer Anders Celsius (1701-44), who devised the inverted form of this scale (ice point $100^{\circ}$, steam point $0^{\circ}$ ) in 1742.
