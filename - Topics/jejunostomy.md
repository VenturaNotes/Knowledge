- $n$. a surgical operation in which the jejunum is brought through the abdominal wall as a stoma. It may enable the insertion of a jejunal catheter for short-term infusion of nutrients or other substances. A feeding jejunostomy is a tube inserted into the jejunum using endoscopic or surgical techniques to allow the introduction of nutrients. This may be required when disease, previous surgery, or refractory vomiting prevents the placement of a gastrostomy (PEG) tube. A percutaneous endoscopic gastrojejunostomy (PEG-J) is a jejunal extension that is applied to an existing PEG tube.
