- $n$. the conversion of lung tissue, which normally holds air, into a solid liver-like mass during the course of acute lobar pneumonia. In the early stages of lobar pneumonia, the lungs show red hepatization due to the presence of red and white blood cells in the alveolar spaces. As the disease progresses, the red cells are destroyed and phagocytosed, resulting in grey hepatization.
