- A chemical process in which nitrates in the soil are reduced to molecular nitrogen, which is released into the atmosphere. This process is effected by denitrifying bacteria (e.g. Pseudomonas denitrificans ), which use nitrates as a source of energy in respiration. Compare NITRIFICATION. See NITROGEN CYCLE.
