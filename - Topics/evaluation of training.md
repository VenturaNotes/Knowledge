- An assessment of the effectiveness of personnel training programmes. Ideally, such a review should be carried out at four levels:
	- (1) reaction-What did the trainees themselves think of the programme? This involves collecting data directly from trainees about their reaction to the length, depth, pace, difficulty, and usefulness of the training.
	- (2) learning-How much new knowledge has been acquired by the trainees? This can be assessed by testing trainees on the information content of the course.
	- (3) behaviour-How has the programme affected the behaviour of trainees? To answer this, supervisors must find evidence of new skills or positive behavioural traits that can be attributed directly to the programme.
	- (4) results-How has the effectiveness of the group or organization as a whole benefitted from the training? This involves relating the answers received for questions (1), (2), and (3) to an agreed system of performance measurement for the organization.
