## Source[^2]
- $n$. An apparently sound argument yielding either a contradiction or a prima facie absurdity. The US philosopher and logician Willard Van Orman Quine (1908-2000), in an article in the journal Scientific American in 1962, introduced a threefold classification into veridical paradoxes, whose conclusions are true, such as Hempel's paradox; falsidical paradoxes, whose conclusions are false, such as the unexpected hanging paradox or the sorites paradox; and antinomies, whose conclusions are mutually contradictory, such as Russell's paradox, the liar paradox, or Grelling's paradox. The term is also used more loosely for any argument that yields a surprising conclusion, or even for a fact or phenomenon that seems surprising, but the latter is avoided in careful usage.
