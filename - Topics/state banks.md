- Commercial banks in the USA that were established by state charter rather than federal charter (compare NATIONAL BANKS). The rules governing their trading are controlled by state laws and there are therefore differences in practices from state to state. State banks are not compelled to join the Federal Reserve System, although national banks are. State banks are regulated by state banking departments and by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Even if they choose not to join the Federal Reserve System, they must abide by its rules, particularly on consumer credit protection.
