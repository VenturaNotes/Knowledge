- (cecum) (pl. caeca or ceca) A pouch in the alimentary canal of vertebrates between the small intestine and colon. The caecum (and its appendix) is large and highly developed in herbivorous animals (e.g. rabbits and cows), in which it contains a large population of bacteria essential for the breakdown of cellulose. In humans the caecum is a vestigial organ and is poorly developed.
