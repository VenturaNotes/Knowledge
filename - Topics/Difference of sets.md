## Source[^3]
- The dyadic operation between two sets $S$ and $T$, say, resulting in the set $S-T$ consisting of those elements that are in $S$ but not in $T$. Formally$$S-T=\{s \mid s \in S \text { and } s \notin T\}$$Set difference is a generalization of the idea of the complement of a set and as such is sometimes called the relative complement of $T$ with respect to $S$. The [[symmetric difference]]between two sets $S$ and $T$ is the union of $S-T$ and $T-S$.
- Relative complement is another name for set difference.
