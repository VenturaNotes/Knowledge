- Failure to make payments such as the interest or redemption payments on debt on the due date. Default may be partial or total, ranging from a slight delay in payment accompanied by apologies and promises that payment will soon be forthcoming to total and defiant repudiation. Default is frequently avoided by creditors agreeing to reschedule debt, which they may prefer as it avoids showing bad debts in their own accounts. The main deterrent to default for individuals and firms is that bankruptcy or insolvency makes it difficult to carry on trading. For countries, which as sovereign debtors cannot be made bankrupt, the deterrent to default is that it makes future loans very difficult to obtain.

- A value that is used when no other value has been supplied. Defaults may be stored in a configuration file, or they may be embedded in a program or permanently encoded into ROM, or read from the settings of a DIP switch. Nearly every application has defaults for something. For instance, word processors have default fonts, justification, and page length, World Wide Web browsers have default home pages, compilers have default optimization levels, and drawing programs have default palettes and pen thickness.

- Default is a term used to describe a standard value or setting that is used by a computer program unless a different value or setting is specified by the program user. In computer programming, each default value or setting is often recommended by the manufacturer or what most users would typically choose. For instance, a default printer is the type of printer that a computer assumes the end user will use to print their documents unless the end user specifies otherwise. Televisions, computer monitors, smartphones, tablets, and other devices typically feature a button that allows users to restore their device back to its factory presets. It can return all customized device settings to their original, or default, settings.

- (1) Failure to do something that is required by law, especially failure to comply with the rules of legal procedure. 
- (2) Failure to comply with the terms of a contract. A seller defaults by failing to supply the right quality goods at the time contracted. A buyer defaults by failing to take up documents or pay for goods according to contract. Before taking legal action against a defaulter a default notice must be served on him or her. 
- (3) Failure to make required payments, as on a mortgage or other loan.
