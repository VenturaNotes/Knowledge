- The sale of the same product at different prices to different buyers. Usually practised by monopolists, it requires that a market can be subdivided to exploit different sets of consumers and that these divisions can be sustained. Pure price discrimination rarely exists, since sellers usually differentiate the product slightly (as in first-class rail travel and different types of theatre seat). See also REVENUE MANAGEMENT.

- Charging different prices to different customers for the same good or service. This is possible only if the supplier has some monopoly power and can identify the customer, and if the customer cannot resell the good, or it is expensive to do so. Price discrimination is profitable for a monopolist if different customers have different elasticities of demand, so that marginal revenue in different markets is equal only if price is not. First-degree price discrimination involves selling every unit at the maximum the purchaser would pay, so that there is no consumer surplus and the producer takes all potential benefits from a good. First-degree price discrimination defines an upper limit to what producers can gain but producers usually lack the information needed to discriminate this much. Second-degree price discrimination occurs when producers cannot tell which group customers belong to, but offer alternative contracts which induce consumers to identify themselves. Third-degree price discrimination occurs when sellers can identify different groups of customers, and offer different prices to each group.
