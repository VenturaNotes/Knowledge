- The sale of the same product at different prices to different buyers. Usually practised by monopolists, it requires that a market can be subdivided to exploit different sets of consumers and that these divisions can be sustained. Pure price discrimination rarely exists, since sellers usually differentiate the product slightly (as in first-class rail travel and different types of theatre seat). See also REVENUE MANAGEMENT.
