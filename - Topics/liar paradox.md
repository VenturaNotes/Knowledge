- The paradox that arises from considering the truth of the statement 'This statement is false'. 
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A profound and intractable though simple paradox discovered by ancient Greek thinkers. Epimenides, the Cretan, says that all Cretans are liars; if he is telling the truth, then he must be a liar, and if he is lying, then he must be telling the truth. The simplest version of the paradox is the statement This statement is false; if it is true, then it must be false, and if it is false, then it must be true. The paradox was mentioned by St Paul in his epistle to Titus ( $1: 12$ ), although Paul evidently failed to grasp its point. See also metalanguage.
