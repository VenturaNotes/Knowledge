- A package of multimedia files that can be downloaded from the Internet and played on a computer or a mobile device. The first podcasts were of music tracks that could be played on MP3 players; the technique was subsequently generalized to include other audio content and then additional file types, in particular images and video. New podcasts are generally advertised by web feeds, then downloaded automatically to subscribers' computers and, if appropriate, transferred to portable player. Established broadcasting organizations are now making their television and radio output available as podcasts.
