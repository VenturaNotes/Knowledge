- $n$. psychological (as opposed to physical) methods for the treatment of mental disorders and psychological problems. There are many different approaches to psychotherapy, including psychoanalysis, client-centred therapy, group therapy, and family therapy. These approaches share the views that the relationship between therapist and client is of prime importance, that the goal is to help personal development and self-understanding generally rather than only to remove symptoms, and that the therapist does not direct the client's decisions. They have all been very widely applied to differing clinical conditions; in the treatment of mental illness, various psychotherapeutic approaches are used with success, for example cognitive behavioral therapy in depression and anxiety and psychosocial interventions in schizophrenia.
