- An event occurring during execution of a program that makes continuation impossible or undesirable. Examples include division by zero, arithmetic overflow, array reference with index out of bounds, fault condition on a peripheral, and external interrupt. Some programming languages respond to an exception by aborting execution, but others (e.g. Ada, C++) allow the programmer to provide a piece of code$\textemdash$called an exception handler$\textemdash$that is automatically invoked when the exception occurs. This can take appropriate remedial action, then either resume execution of the program (at the point where the exception occurred or elsewhere) or terminate the program in a controlled manner.
## Source[^2]
- An exception is an unprecedented event that occurs after the execution of a software program, disrupting the normal flow of instructions. Various kinds of errors, including programing errors, hard disk crashes, and loss of connectivity, can result in exceptions. Typically, computer programmers can anticipate exceptions and address them within the code of a program. This practice is known as exception handling.
