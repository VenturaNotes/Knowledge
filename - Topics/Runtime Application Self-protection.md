- Runtime application self-protection (RASP) is a type of technology that identifies and blocks attacks in an app. It runs on a server and identifies attacks on the app in real time by analyzing its behavior. The entire process is automated, providing users with peace of mind. When RASP detects a threat, it secures the application without affecting its performance.
