- an operation to correct severe degrees of myopia (short-sightedness). A disc of corneal tissue (from the stroma of the cornea) is removed, frozen, and remodelled on a lathe, then replaced into the cornea to alter its curvature and thus reduce the myopia. Excimer laser treatment, which is easier to perform, has now replaced this (see LASIK).
