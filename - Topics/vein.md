- $n$. a blood vessel conveying blood towards the heart. All veins except the pulmonary vein carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues, via the capillaries, to the vena cava (see illustration overleaf). The walls of veins consist of three tissue layers, but these are much thinner and less elastic than those of arteries. Veins contain valves that assist the flow of blood back to the heart. Anatomical name: vena. $\textemdash$venous adj.
