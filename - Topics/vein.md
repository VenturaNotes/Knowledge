- $n$. a blood vessel conveying blood towards the heart. All veins except the pulmonary vein carry deoxygenated blood from the tissues, via the capillaries, to the vena cava (see illustration overleaf). The walls of veins consist of three tissue layers, but these are much thinner and less elastic than those of arteries. Veins contain valves that assist the flow of blood back to the heart. Anatomical name: vena. $\textemdash$venous adj.

## Source[^2]
- (1) A blood vessel that carries blood towards the heart. Most veins carry deoxygenated blood (the pulmonary vein is an exception). The largest veins are fed by smaller ones, which are formed by the merger of venules. Veins have thin walls and a relatively large internal diameter. Valves within the veins ensure that the flow of blood is always towards the heart. Compare ARTERY. 
- (2) A vascular bundle in a leaf (see VENATION). 
- (3) Any of the tubes of chitin that strengthen an insect's wing.
