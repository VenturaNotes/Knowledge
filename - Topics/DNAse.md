- $n$. an enzyme that catalyses the cleavage of DNA. A genetically engineered form, recombinant human DNAse (dornase alfa), is used in the treatment of cystic fibrosis to reduce the viscosity of the sticky secretions in the lungs. Administered by inhalation via a jet nebulizer, it appears to hydrolyse extracellular DNA that accumulates with other neutrophil debris in the airways. Trade name: Pulmozyme.

- (deoxyribonuclease; DNAase) An enzyme that catalyses the cleavage of DNA. DNase I is a digestive enzyme, secreted by the pancreas, that degrades DNA into shorter nucleotide fragments. Many other endonucleases and exonucleases cleave DNA, including the restriction enzymes and enzymes involved in DNA repair and replication.
