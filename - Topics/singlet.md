- An atomic state in which two spin angular momenta of electrons cancel each other, resulting in zero net spin. A singlet state usually has a higher energy than a triplet state because of the effect of correlations of spin on the Coulomb interactions between electrons (as in Hund's rules). This can lead to substantial energy differences between triplet and singlet states.
