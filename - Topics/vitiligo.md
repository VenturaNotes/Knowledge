- $n$. a common disorder in which symmetrical white or pale macules appear on the skin. The face and extremities (including the genitalia) are commonly affected. It is more conspicuous in darker skin types. Vitiligo is an autoimmune disease and may occur with other such diseases (e.g. thyroid disease or alopecia areata). It is usually progressive, although spontaneous repigmentation may occur. Treatment with potent topical corticosteroids, topical calcineurin inhibitors, or phototherapy may be effective. Cosmetic camouflage may be necessary if treatments are unsuccessful.
