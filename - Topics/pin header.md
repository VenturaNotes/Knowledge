- A device similar in form to a DIP but containing no circuitry. Instead each leg is extended vertically through the package allowing pins to be connected together in any configuration by soldering small pieces of wire across the relevant pins. A pin header is more flexible but clumsier than a DIL switch. It is sometimes used for making external connections to a printed circuit board.
