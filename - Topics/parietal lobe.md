## Synthesis
- Situated in the upper back of the cerebral cortex
- Plays a significant role in various aspects of memory including working memory, spatial memory, recognition memory. Supports these memory functions 
## Source[^1]
- One of the major divisions of each cerebral hemisphere (see CEREBRUM), lying behind the frontal lobe, above the temporal lobe, and in front of the occipital lobe. It is thus beneath the crown of the skull. It contains the sensory cortex and association areas.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. The upper lobe on the side of each cerebral hemisphere, separated on its lateral or outer surface from the frontal lobe by the central sulcus, from the temporal lobe by the lateral sulcus and an imaginary line extending it horizontally towards the occipital lobe, and from the occipital lobe by an imaginary line from the top of the parieto-occipital sulcus to the pre-occipital notch. The right parietal lobe is especially involved in appreciation of spatial relationships. Lesions in either hemisphere in the somatosensory association area (see somatosensory cortex) can result in astereognosis, and lesions in the parietal operculum immediately above the lateral sulcus can lead to spatial neglect. See also aphasia, autotopagnosia, Gerstmann syndrome, lobe, mirror neuron, operculum. \[From Latin parietalis of a wall, from paries a wall]
