- printer An output device that converts the coded information from the processor into a readable or pictorial form on paper or transparent media. There are many types, varying in method, speed, and quality of printing: there are serial printers, line printers, and page printers, and these may be solid-font or matrix printers. Many matrix printers, including laser and inkjet printers, can act as plotters. Printer technology may or may not use mechanical impact to transfer ink (see IMPACT PRINTER, NONIMPACT PRINTER).
