- Of or relating to movements that take place through the action of the nervous system independently of the will. These movements generally involve the involuntary reaction being correlated with a voluntary action. For example, the reflex action of both pupils contracting will occur even if only one retina has been stimulated by bright light (see PUPILLARY REFLEX).
