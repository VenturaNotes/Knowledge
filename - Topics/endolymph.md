## Source[^3]
- $n$. A fluid contained within the scala media and the semicircular canals of the inner ears, functioning as an inertial mass resisting angular acceleration of the head, so that when the head is rotated, the hair cells that extend from the crista into the gelatinous membrane or cupula bend in the opposite direction, triggering nerve impulses. See also otolith. Compare perilymph. \[From Greek endon within + Latin lympha water, influenced by Greek nymphe a nymph, alluding to the fact that it is a fluid within the membranous labyrinth, unlike perilymph]
