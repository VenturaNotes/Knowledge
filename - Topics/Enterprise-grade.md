- Enterprise-grade refers to a tool or application that integrates easily into a company's existing network infrastructure. To be enterprise-grade, an app or device must meet specific criteria. For instance, it must have robust security and proper functionality to ensure high productivity. It must also be capable of being administered on a highly granular level (i.e., capable of being controlled by a program administrator) and offer external support when a business needs assistance.
