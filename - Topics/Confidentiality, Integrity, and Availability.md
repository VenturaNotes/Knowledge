- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (otherwise referred to as the CIA Triad) is the backbone of information security. This model guides the policies for information security with an established organization.
- Confidentiality is a set of rules that limits access to sensitive information. Confidentiality measures should prevent company information from being accessed by the wrong hands. Integrity is the assurance that the information is not only trustworthy, but accurate. To maintain integrity information, security teams must ensure that data is unaltered by data transfers and secure from unauthorized alterations.
- Availability is a guarantee that authorized persons will be able to access the information when necessary. To guarantee data availability, proper security measures must be in place to maintain software and hardware infrastructures.
