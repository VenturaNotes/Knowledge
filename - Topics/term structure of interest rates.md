- A set of discount rates for each year to maturity, applied to fixed-rate securities such as government bonds. The term structure of interest rates is related to the yield curve, but differs from this in that it gives a discount rate appropriate for individual years to maturity, rather than the discount rate for all years on a bond to maturity.
