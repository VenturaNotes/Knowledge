- A set of discount rates for each year to maturity, applied to fixed-rate securities such as government bonds. The term structure of interest rates is related to the yield curve, but differs from this in that it gives a discount rate appropriate for individual years to maturity, rather than the discount rate for all years on a bond to maturity.
## Source[^2]
- The relation between the rate of interest paid by a financial security and the time until maturity of the security. The term structure is generally upward-sloping so that securities with longer maturities pay higher rates of interest. This slope may be reversed if on average interest rates are expected to fall.
