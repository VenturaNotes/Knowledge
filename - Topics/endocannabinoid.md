- $n$. A substance manufactured within the body, closely related to the active psychotropic ingredient of cannabis, functioning as an important regulator to control pain, to govern the flow of blood, and to influence the operation of the immune system in ways that are not well understood. The existence of endocannabinoids, suspected for decades, was established in the late 1990s. \[From Greek endon within + English cannabis + -oid indicating likeness or resemblance, from Greek eidos shape or form]
