- Symbol m. The SI unit of length that is equal to 39.37 inches. It is formally defined as the length of the path travelled by light in vacuum during a time interval of 1/299,792,458 of a second. This definition, adopted by the General Conference on Weights and Measures in October 1983, replaced the 1960 definition based on the krypton lamp, i.e. 1,650,763.73 wavelengths in a vacuum of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the levels $2 \mathrm{p}^{10}$ and $5 \mathrm{d}^{5}$ of the nuclide krypton-86. This definition replaced the older (1927) definition of a meter based on a platinum-iridium bar of standard length.
