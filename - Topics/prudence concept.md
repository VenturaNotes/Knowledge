- The accounting concept that insists on a realistic view of business activity and stresses that anticipated revenues and profits have no place in a profit and loss account until they have been realized in the form of cash or other assets for which the ultimate cash value can be assessed with reasonable certainty. However, provision should be made for all known expenses and losses whether the amount of these is known with certainty or is a best estimate in the context of the information available.
- The prudence concept was identified as a fundamental accounting concept in Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (SSAP) 2, Disclosure of Accounting Policies, the UK Companies Acts, and the EU's Fourth Company Law Directive; it is also emphasized in the Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. However, current thinking recognizes the prudence concept as a desirable rather than a fundamental quality of financial information.
