- the amount of blood ejected by the heart in a minute, as measured with a pulmonary artery catheter. The range is $4.0-8.0 \mathrm{~l} / \mathrm{min}$.
## Source[^2]
- The volume of blood pumped per minute by each ventricle, which is also the total blood flow through the pulmonary circuit. At rest, normal human cardiac output averages approximately 5 litres per minute, which can increase up to fivefold during physical exertion. The cardiac output can be calculated from heart rate (number of beats per minute) and stroke volume (volume of blood expelled from the heart per beat).
