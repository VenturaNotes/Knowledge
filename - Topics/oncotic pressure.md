- a pressure represented by the pressure difference that exists between the osmotic pressure of blood and that of the lymph or tissue fluid. Oncotic pressure is important for regulating the flow of water between blood and tissue fluid. See also OSMOSIS.
## Source[^2]
- (colloid osmotic pressure) The part of the osmotic pressure produced by colloids (i.e. proteins and other large molecules) present within the blood vascular system. The vessel walls are relatively impermeable to these molecules. Oncotic pressure largely offsets the hydrostatic pressure that tends to drive water from blood vessels into the extracellular spaces and tissues. Hence, if oncotic pressure falls, there is increased risk of fluid accumulation and swelling in tissues (oedema).
