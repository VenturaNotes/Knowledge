- Let || || and || ||' be two norms on a real (or complex) vector space X. They are equivalent if there are positive constant $a, b$ for which $a||x|| \le ||x||' \le b||x||$ for all $x$ in $X$. Equivalent norms induce the same topology; all norms on a finite-dimensional vector space are equivalent.
