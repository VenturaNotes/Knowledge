- A well-known algorithmically unsolvable decision problem. Given a finite set of 'dominoes' of the form shown in Fig. $a$, with $u$ and $v$ being strings, the question is whether or not one can form a sequence, as shown in Fig. $b$, such that reading all the $u$ s in order gives the same string as reading all the vs. Fig. $c$ shows such a sequence, where $\Lambda$ is the empty string. Even though there are only finitely many different dominoes given, there is an infinite supply of duplicates for each one; the same domino can thus be used more than once in the sequence. Dominoes cannot be inverted.
- Depending on the dominoes given, it is sometimes obvious that the answer to the question is 'no'. However there is no algorithm that can discover this in all cases.
