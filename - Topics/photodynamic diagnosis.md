- a technique for improving the sensitivity and specificity of bladder cancer diagnosis at cystoscopy using a light-sensitive agent. This agent is instilled into the bladder, taken up by the epithelial cells, and converted into a porphyrin that accumulates only in malignant and premalignant cells. It fluoresces under light of a specific wavelength and is thus highlighted against normal bladder mucosa.
