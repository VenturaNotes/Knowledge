- The production and consumption of goods and services. This can take place through organized markets or through non-market activities such as household production. The extent of economic activity in a country is measured by national income and an increase in activity is reflected in economic growth; both measures are incomplete if they do not include all forms of household production. The benefits from economic activity are captured in social welfare or by a happiness index.
