- The pay of the employed labour force. Earnings include payment for overtime and bonuses, as well as basic pay. They are distinguished from wage rates, which refer to normal time working only and exclude bonuses. Earnings normally rise faster than wage rates when economic activity increases, and fall relative to wage rates when economic activity declines. See also TRANSFER EARNINGS.
