- The pay of the employed labor force. Earnings include payment for overtime and bonuses, as well as basic pay. They are distinguished from wage rates, which refer to normal time working only and exclude bonuses. Earnings normally rise faster than wage rates when economic activity increases, and fall relative to wage rates when economic activity declines. See also TRANSFER EARNINGS.
### (company)
- The part of the profits of a company available for equity shareholders, after deducting debenture interest. Companies may distribute these earnings in dividends, pay tax, or retain them to expand the business. Share prices are believed to depend strongly on company earnings. See also RETAINED EARNINGS.
