- $n$. paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye (see CILIARY BODY). This causes inability to alter the focus of the eye and is usually accompanied by paralysis of the muscles of the iris, resulting in fixed dilation of the pupil (mydriasis). It is induced by the use of atropine or similar drugs in order to inactivate the muscle in cases of inflammation of the iris and ciliary body and to objectively assess the refractive status of the eye, particularly in children. It may also occur after injuries to the eye.
