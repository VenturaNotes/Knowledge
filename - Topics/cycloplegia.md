- $n$. paralysis of the ciliary muscle of the eye (see CILIARY BODY). This causes inability to alter the focus of the eye and is usually accompanied by paralysis of the muscles of the iris, resulting in fixed dilation of the pupil (mydriasis). It is induced by the use of atropine or similar drugs in order to inactivate the muscle in cases of inflammation of the iris and ciliary body and to objectively assess the refractive status of the eye, particularly in children. It may also occur after injuries to the eye.

- $n$. Paralysis of the ciliary muscles that alter the shape of the crystalline lens of the eye, resulting in loss of ability to focus, often induced by anticholinergic drugs. cycloplegic adj.
