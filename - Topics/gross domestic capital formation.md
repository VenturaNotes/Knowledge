- A measure of total investment. 'Gross' indicates that it is measured without subtracting any allowance for capital consumption; 'domestic' that it refers to investment in the country regardless of ownership. It thus includes investment in the country by companies owned by non-residents, and excludes investment abroad by resident firms.
