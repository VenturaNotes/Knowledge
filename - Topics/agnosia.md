- $n$. A term introduced in 1891 by the Austrian neurologist and founder of psychoanalysis Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), nowadays denoting an impairment of ability to recognize or identify familiar objects, entities, or people, usually as a result of a neurological deficit or disorder. The major forms are: ahrlognosia (impaired ability to discriminate by touch such physical properties of objects as their weight, density, or texture; compare AMORPHOGNOSIA, TACTILE AGNOSIA); amorphognosia (impaired ability to recognize by touch the size and shape of objects; compare AHYLOGNOSIA, TACTILE AGNOSIA); anosognosia (impaired ability or refusal to recognize that one has a sensory or motor impairment or, in some cases following a massive stroke and hemiplegia, even to recognize part of one's body as one's own); apperceptive agnosia (impaired ability to identify and discriminate between objects, usually associated with right hemisphere brain damage, also called visual shape agnosia , in contrast to associative agnosia); asomatagnosia (impaired ability to recognize one's own body or part of it; compare anosognosia, AUTOTOPAGNOSIA); associative agnosia (impaired ability to interpret or give meaning to objects, as in failing to understand that a 4 -inch-long hollow cylinder, closed at one end, with a loop attached to the outside, is a mug, in contrast to apperceptive agnosia); auditory agnosia (impaired ability to recognize or identify familiar sounds or spoken words); autotopagnosia (see also separate entry; impaired ability to identify parts of one's own body, often indicative of lesions in the pathway between the thalamus and the parietal lobes; compare ASOMATAGNOSIA, FINGER AGNOSIA, TOPAGNOSIA); colour agnosia (impaired ability to recognize or identify colours in spite of intact colour discrimination and adequate language skills; compare ACHROMATOPSIA); finger agnosia (see also separate entry; impaired ability to recognize, identify, differentiate, name, select, or indicate individual fingers of either hand, hence a form of autotopagnosia); gustatory agnosia (impaired ability to recognize or identify tastes); haptic agnosia (another name for tactile agnosia); horologagnosia (impaired ability to tell the time); integrative agnosia (intact ability to recognize elements of perceptual forms with impaired ability to integrate the elements into perceptual wholes); logagnosia (another name for Wernicke's aphasia); object blindness (impaired ability to identify objects that are clearly perceived); olfactory agnosia (impaired ability to recognize or identify smells); optic agnosia (impaired ability to identify objects by sight, with intact ability to identify them by touch); phonagnosia (see also separate entry; impaired ability to identify people by their voices); prosopagnosia (see also separate entry; impaired ability to recognize or identify previously familiar faces, sometimes even those of close relatives, such faces being identified as faces but not as belonging to particular known people, this form of agnosia usually being associated with damage to the posterior right hemisphere); simultanagnosia (see also separate entry; impaired ability to perceive more than one object at the same time, often occurring as a symptom of BÃ¡lint's syndrome); tactile agnosia (see also separate entry; impaired ability to recognize or identify objects by touch alone, also called haptic agnosia, tactoagnosia, compare ahylognosia, amorphognosia); topagnosia (impaired ability to identify which part of one's body has been touched, compare AUTOTOPAGNOSIA); topographagnosia (see also separate entry; impaired ability to find one's way around, read maps, draw plans, and perform similar tasks, often associated with damage to the right hemisphere parietal lobe, comparable to visuospatial agnosia); transformational agnosia (impaired ability to recognize objects viewed from unusual angles, such as a tennis racket seen from its side, based on the assumption that the impairment derives from a deficit in the ability to transform the major or minor axislength or width-when it appears foreshortened, often associated with damage to the right parietal lobe, also called apperceptive agnosia ); visual agnosia (impaired ability to recognize or identify visual images or stimuli); visual shape agnosia (impaired ability to identify and discriminate between objects, usually associated with right hemisphere brain damage, also called visual apperceptive agnosia , in contrast to associative agnosia); visuospatial agnosia (impaired ability to count a small number of scattered objects, coupled with peculiar alignment of handwriting, such as confining the words to only one half of a page, impairment in reading ability, impaired ability to copy simple drawings, often associated with damage to the right hemisphere at the junction of the occipital and parietal lobes, compare topographagnosia). Also called acatamathesia . \[From Greek $a$ without + gnosis knowledge + -ia indicating a condition or quality]

## Source[^2]
- $n$. a disorder of the brain whereby the patient cannot interpret sensations correctly although the sense organs and nerves conducting sensation to the brain are functioning normally. It is due to a disorder of the association areas in the parietal lobes. In auditory agnosia the patient can hear but cannot interpret sounds (including speech). A patient with tactile agnosia (astereognosis) retains normal sensation in his hands but cannot recognize three-dimensional objects by touch alone. In visual agnosia the patient can see but cannot interpret symbols, including letters (see ALEXIA).
