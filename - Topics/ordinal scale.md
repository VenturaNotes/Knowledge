- A scale in which data are ranked but without units of measurement to indicate the size of differences. So the values used in calculating Spearman’s or another rank correlation coefficient are on an ordinal scale.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A scale of measurement in which data are arranged in order of magnitude but there is no standard measure of degrees of difference between them, for example a ranking of tennis players. See also MEASUREMENT LEVEL, RANK, SCALE (1), UNFOLDING TECHNIQUE. Compare ABSOLUTE SCALE, INTERVAL SCALE, LOG-INTERVAL SCALE, NOMINAL SCALE, RATIO SCALE. \[From Latin ordinalis of the order in a sequence, from ordo a row or order]
