- Platform independent refers to software that runs on a variety of operating systems or hardware platforms. It is the opposite of platform dependent, which refers to software that is only to run on one operating system or hardware platform. An example of platform-independent software is Microsoft Windows, which also runs on Mac systems. Because platform-independent software works across different computing environments, businesses don't have to maintain multiple versions of a type of program.
