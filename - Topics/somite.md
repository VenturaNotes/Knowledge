- $n$. any of the paired segmented divisions of mesoderm that develop along the length of the early embryo. The somites differentiate into voluntary muscle, bones, connective tissue, and the deeper layers of the skin (see DERMATOME; MYOTOME; SCLEROTOME).
## Source[^2]
- Any of a series of segmented blocks of tissue in animal embryos that develop from the mesoderm. In vertebrate embryos they lie on the dorsal side of the notochord and give rise to the vertebral column, ribs, dermis, and striated muscle. In invertebrates showing metameric segmentation the somites give rise to the body segments.
