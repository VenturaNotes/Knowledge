- (partial order) A relation defined between elements of some set and satisfying certain properties, discussed below. It is basically a convenient generalization of the usual comparison operators, such as $>$ or $<$, that are typically defined on the integers or the real numbers. The generalization also captures the essential properties of the set operations such as 'is a subset of', the alphabetic ordering of strings, and so on. In denotational semantics, partial orderings are used to express some approximation relation between partially defined computational objects.
- Two different but equivalent definitions of a partial ordering are possible. The first is a generalization of the usual $\leq$ operation in which the relation must be a transitive, antisymmetric, and reflexive relation defined on the set $S$. The second definition is a generalization of the usual < operation in which the relation must be a transitive, asymmetric, and irreflexive relation defined on $S$. A set with a partial ordering defined on it is called a partially ordered set or sometimes a poset.
