- Corporate financial planning applications are software apps used in business performance management and strategy planning. These apps are sometimes called strategic corporate planning management (SCPM) solutions. SCPM apps vary greatly in their focus. Some assist only the needs of the finance department, focusing solely on money matters, while others provide planning support and resources across all areas of business, from risk management to sales strategy. Corporate financial planning helps business leaders and managers create meaningful plans based on business goals or an overall business vision. It may use data integration, forecasting, analytics, or business intelligence tools to do this.
