- Cloud security is technology and processes designed to protect data that is stored online from potential threats. Cloud security may include firewalls, simulated hack tests, encryption, tokenization, virtual private networks (VPN), and other methods to protect information from cyber-threats. Also, cloud security prevents data from being accessible through public internet connections.
