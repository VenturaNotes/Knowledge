- (Ekbom's syndrome) a condition in which a sense of uneasiness, restlessness, and itching, often accompanied by twitching and pain, is felt in the calves of the legs when sitting or lying down, especially in bed at night. The only relief is walking or moving the legs, which often leads to insomnia. The cause is unknown: it may be inadequate circulation, nerve damage (see PERIPHERAL NEUROPATHY), deficiency of iron, vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$, or folate, or a reaction to antipsychotic or antidepressant drugs. In severe cases treatment with a dopamine receptor agonist (e.g. pramipexole) may be helpful.
