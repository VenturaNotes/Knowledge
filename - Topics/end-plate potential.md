- (EPP) The electric potential, measured in millivolts (mV), produced by depolarization of the end plate at a neuromuscular junction in response to stimulation by the motor neuron. The depolarization results from release of excitatory neurotransmitter molecules, which activate receptors in the postsynaptic membrane, causing transient opening of ion channels and allowing cations to flow briefly through the membrane. In vertebrate skeletal muscle a single EPP, typically about $10\textendash20~ \mathrm{mV}$ in amplitude, triggers an action potential in the muscle fiber, which propagates through the fiber causing it to contract.

- $n$. The depolarization of a postsynaptic cell membrane of a muscle fiber when it is stimulated at the motor end plate by a motor neuron, causing the muscle fiber to contract. Compare miniature END-PLATE POTENTIAL. EPP abbrev.
