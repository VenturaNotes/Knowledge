- (trade terms) A reduction on the recommended retail price of a product or service that is offered to distributors because they buy regularly in bulk. The difference between the retail price and the discounted price provides the retailer with his overheads and profit. The amount of the trade discount will often depend on the size of an order. Thus, a supermarket chain buying goods in very large quantities expects a higher trade discount than a corner shop buying in small quantities. It is also usual for members of the same trade to offer each other trade terms as a matter of course.
