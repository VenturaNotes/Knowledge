- abbrev. Gamma-hydroxybutyrate, a colorless, odourless, saltytasting liquid that acts as an anaesthetic (1) drug with sedative-hypnotic and antidepressant effects. It became popular as a street drug in the late 1990s, at moderate doses having a general calming effect, lowering inhibitions, and increasing sociability, and at high doses causing nausea, muscle stiffness, confusion, convulsions, and possible coma and respiratory collapse. Also called gamma-OH (trademark). Often humorously called GBH, especially in the UK. See also SEdATIVE-HYPNOTIC; SEDATIVE-, HYPNOTIC-, OR ANXIOLYTIC-RELATED DISORDERS, SOCIABILIZER.
