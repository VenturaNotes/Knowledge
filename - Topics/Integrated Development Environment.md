- An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that allows developers to create, edit, and compile code within one program. These applications often have built-in tools, such as syntax highlighting and autocompletion, making coding easier for programmers. They may also provide debugging capabilities and other features, such as version control integration, so you can keep track of changes made over time without having multiple variations of your code cluttering your hard drive.
