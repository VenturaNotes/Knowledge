- $n$. a hollow muscular cone-shaped organ, lying between the lungs, with the pointed end (apex) directed downwards, forwards, and to the left. The heart is about the size of a closed fist. Its wall consists largely of cardiac muscle (myocardium), lined and surrounded by membranes (see ENDOCARDIUM; PERICARDIUM). It is divided by a septum into separate right and left halves, each of which is divided into an upper atrium and a lower ventricle (see illustration). Deoxygenated blood from the venae cavae passes through the right atrium to the right ventricle. This contracts and pumps blood to the lungs via the pulmonary artery. The newly oxygenated blood returns to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins and passes through to the left ventricle. This forcefully contracts, pumping blood out to the body via the aorta. The direction of blood flow within the heart is controlled by valves.
