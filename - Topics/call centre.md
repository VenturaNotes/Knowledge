- An office whose sole purpose is to handle large numbers of incoming or outgoing telephone calls. It may be used for telephone sales, to carry out marketing research (see CENTRAL LOCATION TELEPHONE INTERVIEWING), or by large organizations wishing to deal with all enquiries centrally rather than in local branches. A blended call centre is one in which the same agents deal with both incoming and outgoing calls. The early 2000s saw a trend for major UK organizations to site their call centres in other English-speaking countries where labour is cheaper (e.g. India).
