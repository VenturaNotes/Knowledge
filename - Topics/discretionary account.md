- (DA) An account placed with a stockbroker, securities house, commodity broker or other authorized investment manager in which they are empowered to carry out transactions on this account without referring back for approval to the principal. Principals normally set parameters for their accounts, but with a discretionary account the broker has more discretion, only reporting back on purchases, sales, profits and losses, and the value of the portfolio.
