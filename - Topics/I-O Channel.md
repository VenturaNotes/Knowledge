- An I/O channel is a piece of equipment in the input/output system of a computing device. The channel transfers data between the device's storage unit and computer peripherals, which are external devices such as keyboards and monitors. Data is transferred when a user executes the I/O commands. An I/O channel informs a computer's central processing unit (CPU) when an error occurs during data transfer.
