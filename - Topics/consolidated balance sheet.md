- The balance sheet of a group providing the financial information contained in the individual financial statements of the parent company of the group and its subsidiary undertakings, combined subject to any necessary consolidation adjustments. It must give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of a group as at the end of the financial year, and its form and content should comply with the Companies Act. If the balance sheet formats require the disclosure of the balances attributable to group undertakings (creditors, debtors, investments), the information should be analyzed to show the amounts attributable to parent and fellow subsidiary undertakings of the parent company, and amounts attributable to unconsolidated subsidiaries.
