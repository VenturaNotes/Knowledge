- Stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol
- In the application layer and used for sending emails
- Sends emails by transferring them from a client to a server and between servers until it reaches the recipient's [[email server]]
- SMTP is an application-layer protocol and doesn't directly operate in lower layers, though it relies on the [[transport layer]] (TCP) to function 
	- #question are we just saying here that TCP within the transport layer is needed for the application layer to function?
