- DEVA (document-enabled vertical application) is a Gartner concept of applying integrated document and output management (IDOM) technologies in specific industries to support vertical processes. Examples of this include claims processing in insurance, patient records management in healthcare, and mortgage origination for banks. DEVA may sometimes support horizontal processes, such as order processing, that are standard across many industries.
