- $n$. air or gas in the peritoneal or abdominal cavity, usually due to a perforation of the stomach or bowel. It is diagnosed by X-ray of the erect chest or by CT or ultrasound imaging. Pneumoperitoneum may be induced for diagnostic purposes (e.g. laparoscopy). A former treatment of tuberculosis was the deliberate injection of air into the peritoneal cavity to allow the tuberculous lung to be rested (artificial pneumoperitoneum); this was frequently combined with phrenic crush.
