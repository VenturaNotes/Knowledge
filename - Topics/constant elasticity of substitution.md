- The property of production or utility functions such that the ratio between proportional changes in relative prices and proportional changes in relative quantities is always the same. A CES function may be written$$y=k\left[\delta\left(x_{1}\right)^{\rho}+[1-\delta]\left(x_{2}\right)^{\rho}\right]^{1 / \rho}$$where $y$ is output or utility, $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ are inputs, and $k$ is a constant. The ratio of proportional changes in relative quantities to proportional change in relative prices is the elasticity of substitution, $\sigma=1 /(1-\rho)$; if $1>\rho>0$, then $\sigma>1$ and the goods are good substitutes; if $\rho<0$, then $\sigma<1$ and the goods are poor substitutes. The goods are perfect substitutes if $\rho=1$ ('infinitely large' elasticity of substitution). The Cobb-Douglas function is the limiting case corresponding to $\rho=0$; in this case $\sigma=1$.
