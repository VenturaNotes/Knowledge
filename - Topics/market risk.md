- The risk inherent in dealing on a market where prices may change. The obvious market risks are buying on a market that subsequently falls and selling on a market that rises; these risks can be reduced by hedging (see HEDGE), especially by means of futures contracts or options, but they can never be eliminated. These forms of market risk are the obverse of the market opportunities that provide speculators with the chance of making a profit.
