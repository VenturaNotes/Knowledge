- The risk inherent in dealing on a market where prices may change. The obvious market risks are buying on a market that subsequently falls and selling on a market that rises; these risks can be reduced by hedging (see HEDGE), especially by means of futures contracts or options, but they can never be eliminated. These forms of market risk are the obverse of the market opportunities that provide speculators with the chance of making a profit.

- The risk taken by any trader on a market who holds either a long or a short position, that the price will change. The holder of stocks of goods, securities, or currencies not hedged by futures sales runs the risk of losing if the price falls; the seller of futures for goods, securities, or currencies they do not hold runs the risk of losing if the market price rises. Market risk in some markets can be reduced by hedging. Market risk exists even if the other party delivers fully and promptly; it is contrasted with counter-party risk, which is the risk that the other party to a deal may fail to deliver punctually, or at all.
