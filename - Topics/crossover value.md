- (COV) The percentage of linked genes (see LINKAGE) that are exchanged during the process of crossing over during the first prophase of meiosis. The COV can be calculated by the percentage of offspring that show recombination and is used to map the genes on a chromosome (see CHROMOSOME MAP). A small COV for a given pair of genes indicates that the genes are situated close together on the chromosome.
