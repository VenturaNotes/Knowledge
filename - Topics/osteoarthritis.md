- (osteoarthrosis) $n$. a degenerative disease of joints resulting in loss of the articular cartilage, remodelling of adjacent bone, and inflammation. It can be primary or it can occur secondarily to abnormal load to the joint or damage to the cartilage from inflammation or trauma. The joints become painful and stiff with restricted movement. Osteoarthritis is recognized on X-ray by narrowing of the joint space (due to loss of cartilage) and the presence of osteophytes, osteosclerosis, and cysts in the bone. The condition is treated with analgesics, by reducing the load to the joint by weight loss or the use of a walking stick, or surgically by osteotomy, arthrodesis, or arthroplasty.
