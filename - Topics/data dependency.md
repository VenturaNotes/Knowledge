## Source [^1]
- A situation in which an instruction is dependent on a result from a sequentially previous instruction before it can complete its execution. In high-performance processors employing pipeline or superscalar techniques, a data dependency will introduce a disruption in the smooth operation of a processor pipeline or inhibit the parallel issue of instructions in a superscalar processor.
