- Rules and procedures that prevent unauthorized persons from gaining access to information. Together with availability and integrity, confidentiality is generally considered one of the three basic principles of security.

- $n$. an ethical and legal obligation that requires doctors to keep information about their patients private. It is the foundation on which trust and the therapeutic relationship is built. A doctor automatically assumes such an obligation during a patient consultation. Confidentiality is generally considered to be held within the health-care team rather than with one particular professional in order to facilitate effective care, although stricter rules can apply in genitourinary medicine and occupational health (among others). Confidentiality is not an unlimited duty and sometimes it is permissible or even obligatory to breach a patient's confidence, e.g. for child protection or when a patient suffers from a notifiable disease. Confidentiality may also be breached where there is a serious risk of physical harm to an identifiable individual or individuals. However, since there is no 'duty to warn' in the UK, doctors are not obliged to breach confidentiality where there is a serious risk of harm. The GMC requires that doctors should be prepared to justify their decision whether or not they decide to breach confidentiality in cases of serious risk. See also DATA PROTECTION; PRIVACY. $\textemdash$confidential adj.
