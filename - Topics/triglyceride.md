- $n$. a lipid or neutral fat consisting of glycerol combined with three fatty-acid molecules. Triglycerides are synthesized from the products of digestion of dietary fat: they are the form in which digested fat is transported in the bloodstream (see CHYLOMICRON). High concentrations of triglycerides in the blood predisposes to coronary heart disease (see HYPERTRIGLYCERIDAEMIA). Medium-change triglycerides (MCT) have short-chain fatty acids of 8-10 carbon atoms and can be useful for individuals with malabsorption problems as they can be absorbed without the need for bile salts.
