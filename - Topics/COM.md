- (1) (computer output (on) microfilm) Output recorded in miniaturized form on microfilm, either on a reel of film or on card-sized sheets of film known as [[microfiche]]. The term COM also applies to the techniques used to produce this form of output. Special optical viewers must be used to enlarge the information on the microfilm for reading purposes. The facility has been available since the early 1960s. Computer-assisted retrieval of information stored on microfilm usually involves the interrogation of an index, maintained on disk, of the documents stored on the microfilm. See also CIM. 
- (2) (component object model) A component software architecture that allows applications and systems to be built from components supplied by different software vendors.
