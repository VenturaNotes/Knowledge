## Source[^2]
- $n$. the minute gap across which nerve impulses pass from one neuron to the next, at the end of a nerve fibre. Reaching a synapse, an impulse causes the release of a neurotransmitter, which diffuses across the gap and triggers an electrical impulse in the next neuron. Some brain cells have more than 15,000 synapses. See also NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION.
