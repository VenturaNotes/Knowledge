## Source [^1]
- The ratio of a country's debt service payments to its total export earnings. This is normally expressed as a percentage. The higher a country's debt service ratio is, the more likely it is to have difficulty in servicing the debt, either from export earnings or by raising new loans.
## Source[^2]
- (DSR) The proportion of annual export earnings needed to service a country's external debts, including both interest payments and repayment of principal. The DSR is an important statistic, indicating the severity of a country's indebtedness. The effect of rescheduling programmes can be examined by comparing pre- and post-rescheduling DSRs.
