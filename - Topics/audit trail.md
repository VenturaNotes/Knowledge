- (1) A record showing the occurrence of specified events relevant to the security of a computer system. For example, an entry might be made in the audit trail whenever a user logs in or accesses a file. Examination of the audit trail may detect attempts at violating the security of the system and help to identify the violator. 
- (2) The external file that contains the sequential flow of information between the application and a graphics system.

- (paper trail) The sequence of documents, computer files, and other records examined during an audit, showing how a transaction has been dealt with by an organization from start to finish. Documents will require cross-referencing so the trail is not broken. For example, a sales transaction can be traced from the item of stock sold, to the invoice, through the sales day book, to the sales account, and finally to the bank account. In securities dealing the audit trail should enable supervisory bodies to follow transactions and ensure that fair prices have been paid. See also COMPUTER-ASSISTED AUDIT TECHNIQUES.
