## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A method for controlling the performance of an operating system by monitoring outputs and comparing them with the system's design parameters. Because the approach is based on past activities it is essentially reactive. Although it may allow adjustments to be made to avoid problems in the future, it cannot avoid the cost of the original divergence from targets. Compare CONCURRENT CONTROL; FEEDFORWARD CONTROL.
