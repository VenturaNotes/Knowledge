- (pointwise multiplication) Given two real-valued functions $f,g$ on a set $S$, their sum $f+g$ and product $fg$ can be defined pointwise on $S$ by $$(f+g)(s)=f(s) + g(s), \quad (fg)(s) = f(s)g(s),$$where $s \varepsilon S$. Addition and scalar multiplication of functionals in a dual space are likewise defined pointwise. Compare Componentwise.
