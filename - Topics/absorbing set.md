- A subset $S$ of a  vector space $X$ is an absorbing set if for any point $x$ in $X$ then $t x$ lies in $S$ if $t \in \mathbb{R}$ is small enough and positive. An alternative name is a 'radial set', which reflects the notion that the set $S$ will generate all elements of $X$ in the sense that any $x \in X$ can be written as $x=\alpha s$ for some $s \in S$ and some real $\alpha$.
