- The nonreciprocal transfer of genetic material from one homologous chromosome to another, thereby converting a normal (wild-type) allele to a mutant allele, or vice versa. It is believed to occur as a result of recombination between DNA strands of sister chromatids following a double-strand breakage in one chromatid and subsequent mismatch repair using the 'wrong' DNA strand as template. This mechanism can account for the nonMendelian segregation of genetic markers that can sometimes be observed, for example, following meiosis in yeast. Loss of wild-type alleles due to gene conversion is also implicated in the initiation of certain hereditary diseases and cancers in humans.
