- The concept that a single model may not be adequate to explain all the observations made of atomic or subatomic systems in different experiments. For example, electrons behave as particles in some experiments, but in other experiments, such as electron diffraction, they behave as waves. The idea of two different but complementary concepts to treat quantum phenomena was first put forward by the Danish physicist Niels Bohr (1855â€“1962) in 1927.
