- Suppose that certain values $f(x_0), f(x_1), ..., f(x_n)$ of a function $f$ are known, where $x_0 < x_1 < \cdots < x_n.$ A method of finding from these an approximation for $f(x)$, for a given value of $x$ that lies outside the interval $[x_0, x_n]$, is called extrapolation. Such methods are normally far less reliable than interpolation, in which x lies between $x_0$ and $x_n$.

- The estimation of the value of a function (given other values of the function) at a point beyond the interval in which the data lies. One possible approach is to use the value of an interpolation polynomial at this point. An important case arises when the data consists of approximations to the solution of a problem, for different values of a parameter controlling the magnitude of the acceptable error in the method used. A more powerful method can be constructed by extrapolating to the limiting case of the parameter, where the error is zero, using theoretical results giving the dependence of the error on the parameter. This is called [[Richardson extrapolation]] (or the deferred approach to the limit).
## Source[^3]
- Construction of new data points outside the given set of existing data points. Popular methods are linear and polynomial extrapolation; linear extrapolation uses regression-like techniques and is similar to linear prediction. The reliability of extrapolation is measured by the prediction error or the prediction confidence interval.
