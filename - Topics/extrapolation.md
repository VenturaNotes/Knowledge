- Suppose that certain values $f(x_0), f(x_1), ..., f(x_n)$ of a function $f$ are known, where $x_0 < x_1 < \cdots < x_n.$ A method of finding from these an approximation for $f(x)$, for a given value of $x$ that lies outside the interval $[x_0, x_n]$, is called extrapolation. Such methods are normally far less reliable than interpolation, in which x lies between $x_0$ and $x_n$.
