- $n$. A facial expression involving contractions of the muscles at the outer ends of the mouth (zygomatic major muscles), raising the corners of the mouth, and the muscles encircling the eyes (orbicularis oculi muscles), raising the cheeks, narrowing the eye apertures, and producing crows' feet wrinkles at the outer corners of the eyes. In contrast, a non-Duchenne smile involves only the zygomatic major muscles. A Duchenne smile is considered to be indicative of spontaneous and genuine happy emotion, rather than a mere affect display, because the orbicularis oculi muscles are more difficult to control voluntarily. \[Named after the French neurologist Guillaume Benjamin Amand Duchenne (1806-75) who discussed it in his book The Mechanism of Human Facial Expression (1862)]
