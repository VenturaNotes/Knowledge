- Mobile business (or m-business) refers to business models that support the buying and selling of goods or the exchange of information via mobile and wireless technologies. These technologies include smartphones, Bluetooth, e-purses, and WAP. M-business offers even greater mobility than eCommerce, allowing consumers to engage with organizations from a mobile or wireless device wherever they are in the world.
