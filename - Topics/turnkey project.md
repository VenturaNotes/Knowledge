- An investment project where a foreign firm contracts to build a factory, install equipment, and train local labour, and hand it over as a going concern ready to start production. This system means that the supplier's experience of similar plants elsewhere is made available, and unexpected problems have to be resolved before the host country takes over responsibility for the project. The name comes from the notion that the supplier simply hands over the keys when the project is completed.
