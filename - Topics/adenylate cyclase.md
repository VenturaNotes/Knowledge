## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (adenylyl cyclase) The enzyme that catalyses the formation of cyclic AMP. It is bound to the inner surface of the plasma membrane. Many hormones and other chemical messengers exert their physiological effects by increased synthesis of cyclic AMP through the activation of adenylate cyclase. The hormone binds to a receptor on the outer surface of the plasma membrane, which then activates adenylate cyclase on the inner surface via a G protein or calmodulin.
