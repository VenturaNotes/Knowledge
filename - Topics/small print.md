- Printed matter on a document, such as a life-assurance policy or hire-purchase agreement, in which the seller sets out the conditions of the sale and the mutual liabilities of buyer and seller.

This unfair practice has largely been remedied by the various Acts that provide consumer protection. See also COOLING-OFF PERIOD.
