- A trader who expects prices to rise. A trader on a stock or commodity market who believes that prices are more likely to rise than to fall will buy shares, in the hope of selling them at a profit when the price has risen. In extreme cases bulls speculate by contracting to buy forward shares or commodities for which they cannot afford to pay, hoping that when prices rise they will be able to borrow the cash needed for settlement. A bull market is a market dominated by bulls, in which for some time prices tend to rise persistently. See also BEAR; SPECULATION.

- A dealer on a financial market who expects prices to rise. A bull market is one in which prices are rising or expected to rise, i.e. one in which a dealer is more likely to be a buyer than a seller, even to the extent of buying without having made a corresponding sale, thus establishing a bull position or a long position. A bull with a long position hopes to sell these purchases at a higher price after the market has risen. Compare BEAR.
