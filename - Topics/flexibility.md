- The ability to adapt an operating system to respond to changes in the environment. Increasingly seen as a source of competitive advantage in a rapidly changing market, it is an area of operations management in which Japanese practices have had a major impact.

Changes may be called for in terms of the product or service, i.e. the flexibility to introduce new products; mix flexibility is the ability to provide a wide range or mix of products; volume flexibility is the ability to produce different volumes to suit demand; delivery flexibility is the ability to change (usually advance) the delivery date.
