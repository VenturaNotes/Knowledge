## Source [^1]
- A computer that operates on discrete quantities (compare ANALOGUE COMPUTER). All computation is done within a finite number system and with limited precision, associated with the number of digits in the discrete numbers. The numerical information is most often represented by the use of two-state electrical phenomena (on/off, high voltage/low voltage, current/no current, etc.) to indicate whether the value of a binary variable is a 'zero' or a 'one'. Usually there is automatic control or sequencing (through a program) of operations so that they can be carried through to completion without intervention. See also DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS.
