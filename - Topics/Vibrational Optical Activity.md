## Synthesis
- VOA is a technique used to study chiral molecules by analyzing how they interact with polarized light during their vibrational transitions (which means how their atoms move relative to each other in response to energy absorption).
## Source [^1]
- This refers to the difference in absorbance or scattering of a chiral sample when exposed to left versus right circularly polarized radiation, thus allowing the study of the chiral properties of molecules through vibrational transitions
