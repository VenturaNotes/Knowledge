- Interactive voice response (IVR) refers to an automated voice system. IVRs can direct callers to certain departments by establishing a phone tree. A user can enter important customer information with a few inputs and then be directed to a representative in the appropriate department. This can help businesses save time by minimizing staff resources. It can also ensure that a business's customer interactions are more focused.
