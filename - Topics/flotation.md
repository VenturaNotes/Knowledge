- The process of launching a public company for the first time by inviting the public to subscribe in its shares (also known as 'going public'). It applies both to private and to previously nationalized share issues, and can be carried out by means of an introduction, issue by tender, offer for sale, placing, or public issue. After flotation the shares can be traded on a stock exchange. Flotation allows the owners of the business to raise new capital or to realize their investments.
