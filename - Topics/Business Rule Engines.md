- Business Rule Engines (BRE) are a type of programming or software. They manage decision-making and act as a logic tree of "if/then" operations. They can also be viewed as more complex flow charts. Users can insert data into a BRE and it will determine the answer to a question. When executed correctly, they can enable decision-making and remove ambiguity or questions from making a business decision.
