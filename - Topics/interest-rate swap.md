- A form of dealing between banks, security houses, and companies in which institutions exchange interest-rate payments on a notional capital value. Swaps can be in the same currency or cross-currency (see CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST-RATE SWAP). If a swap is in the same currency it will usually involve a fixed interest payment in exchange for a floating interest payment; a swap involving two different floating rates is called a basis swap. See also RATE ANTICIPATION SWAP.
