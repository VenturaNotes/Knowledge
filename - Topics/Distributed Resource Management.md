- DRM is an evolving discipline that uses software, hardware, network tools, procedures, and policies to allow distributed enterprise systems to operate effectively in production. For instance, DRM tools make certain that computer resources are allocated properly to prevent service disruptions. One network component cannot use up all the available resources to the detriment of the others.
