- The implementation of economic policy, in particular monetary and fiscal policy, by means of small, incremental policy changes. Doubt has been cast on any real possibility of fine-tuning economies, given their lack of short-term forecastability. Critics argue that, if an economy is impossible to forecast in detail, then it follows that it is also impossible to determine appropriate short-term incremental policies.
## Source[^2]
- The effort to make precise adjustments in the level of activity via fiscal and monetary policies. Efforts at fine tuning are hampered by lags and minor inaccuracies in the data on which policies are based and the incomplete understanding of the mechanisms by which policies affect the economy.
