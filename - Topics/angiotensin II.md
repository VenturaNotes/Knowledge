- $n$. A polypeptide hormone that causes constriction of the blood vessels, raising blood pressure, precipitates adrenalin release and blocks its reuptake, and stimulates the release of aldosterone, thereby promoting sodium retention. The hormone renin, which is secreted by the kidneys in response to a decline in blood pressure, converts a plasma protein to angiotensin I, and this in turn is converted to angiotensin II by angiotensin converting enzyme. \[From Greek angeion a (blood) vessel + Latin tensus tight, from tendere to stretch $+$ -in(a) indicating an organic compound]
