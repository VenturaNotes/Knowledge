- $n$. a surgical operation for gastro-oesophageal reflux disease in which the upper part of the stomach is wrapped around the lower oesophagus. Nissen fundoplication (named after Swiss surgeon Rudolf Nissen, 1896-1981) consists of a complete (360-degree) wrap; toupe fundoplication is a partial (270-degree) wrap. Fundoplication is now more often performed laparoscopically than via open surgery.
