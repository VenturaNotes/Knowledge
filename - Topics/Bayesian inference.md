- It is a statistical method that uses probabilities to update our belief in a hypothesis based on new evidence or data.
- Grounded in [[Bayes' theorem]] which relates current evidence to prior beliefs

## Source[^2]
- Bayesian inference is a way of making [[statistical inferences]] in which the statistician assigns subjective probabilities to the distributions that could generate the data

## Source[^3]
- An approach to hypothesis testing that involves making an assessment of which of two hypotheses, the null $\left(H_{0}\right)$ or the alternative $\left(H_{1}\right)$, has a higher probability of being correct. First, prior probabilities of each of the hypotheses being correct, $P\left(H_{0}\right)$ and $P\left(H_{1}\right)$, are assumed, and the prior odds ratio, $P\left(H_{0}\right) / P\left(H_{1}\right)$, is formed. Then, based on the prior density functions and the likelihood functions of the data conditioned on each of the hypotheses, the prior odds ratio is modified to form a posterior odds ratio. In contrast to the classical approach, it is not necessary to accept or reject each hypothesis. If needed, such a decision can be made by minimizing the expected loss from making a wrong decision, using some specified loss function, where the expectations are calculated with respect to the posterior probabilities on each hypothesis.
