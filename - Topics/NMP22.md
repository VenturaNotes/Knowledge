- nuclear matrix protein 22, which is involved in DNA replication and gene expression. Significantly elevated levels of NMP22 have been detected in the urine of patients with bladder cancer, which can aid the diagnosis of primary cancer or identify recurrent cancer. The test has a higher sensitivity but lower specificity in comparison with urine cytology.
