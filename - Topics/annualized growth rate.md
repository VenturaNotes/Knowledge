- The rate of growth that would be achieved if the growth over a previous quarter or month were sustained for an entire year. The calculation of the annualized growth rate requires compounding of the quarterly or monthly growth. Multiplying the quarterly growth rate by four (or the monthly by twelve) gives the linear approximation to the annualized growth rate. See also ECONOMIC GROWTH.
