- adj. Of, relating to, or comprising a system of algebra or symbolic logic in which propositions (1) are represented by the binary digits 0 (false) and 1 (true), used especially in computing and electronics. A Boolean algebra comprises a set of elements together with two binary operations (the Boolean sum denoted by the symbol + and the Boolean product denoted by .) obeying certain axioms. In Boolean set theory the Boolean sum is interpreted as set union, the Boolean product as set intersection, 0 as the null set, and 1 as the universal set; in Boolean logic the Boolean sum is interpreted as or, the Boolean product as and, 0 as false, and 1 as true, so that $0+0=0,0+1=1,1+1=1,0 .0=0,0.1=0$, and 1. $1=1$. Boolean set theory and Boolean logic are isomorphic. See also bit, fUZZY LOGIC, SET THEORY. \[Named after the English mathematician George Boole (1815-64) who formulated the ideas in his books Mathematical Analysis of Logic (1847) and An Investigation of the Laws of Thought (1854)]
