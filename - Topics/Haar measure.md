- For a locally compact topological group G there exists a non-trivial measure $\mu$ on the Borel sets such that
	- $\mu$ is invariant meaning $\mu(gS) = \mu(S)$ for a Borel set S and g $\in$ G
	- $\mu$ is countably additive meaning $\mu(^{\infty}_{1}S_k) = \Sigma_1^{\infty}\mu(S_k)$ for disjoint $S_k$.
	- $\mu(S)$ is finite for any compact Borel set S
	- $\mu$ is unique up to a multiplication by a positive scalar
