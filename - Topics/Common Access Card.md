- A common access card (CAC) is a card or token that grants employees access to buildings and resources. Employees can also use it as photo I.D. A CAC has an embedded microchip that enables employees to log in to computers and networks. They can also access controlled spaces and purchase services, such as vending machines and catering services. The microchip includes a digital image of the employee's face, fingerprints, and other personally identifiable data. Some cards rely on two-factor authentication, so employees must swipe their card and then type in a pin code.
