- Brand essence is a short description—generally about three to five words—that describes a companyʻs identity, values, and fundamental nature. Not to be confused with a brand slogan, a brand essence defines a company’s competitive advantage, and helps guide marketing decisions. Therefore, an organization’s brand essence is often authentic to the brand and believable by both customers and their workforce. For instance, Nike’s brand essence is ʻAuthentic Athletic Performance.’ Their brand essence has influenced their company slogan ʻJust Do It’ and fully encompasses the distinctiveness of their brand.
