## Source [^1]
- An important enzyme complex that is present in those microorganisms that are capable of fixing atmospheric nitrogen (see NITROGEN FIXATION). Nitrogenase catalyses the conversion of atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, which can then be used to synthesize nitrites, nitrates, or amino acids. The two main enzymes within the nitrogenase complex are dinitrogenase reductase and dinitrogenase.
