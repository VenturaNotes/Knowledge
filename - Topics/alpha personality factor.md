- $n$. A higher-order factor, arising from the Big Five personality factors, suggested by the US psychologist John Digman (1923-98) in an article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 1997.

The US psychologist Colin G. DeYoung (born 1976) and others have suggested that it represents stability. See also BETA PERSONALITY FACTOR.
