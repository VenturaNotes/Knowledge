- Suppose that the meridian through a point P on the Earth's surface meets the equator at P'. Let O be the center of the Earth. The latitude of P is then the angle P'OP, measured in degrees north or south. Latitude and longitude uniquely fix the position of a point on the Earth's surface. The term also describes the circle of points of a given latitude; and more generally, on a surface of revolution, a latitude is any circle produced by the rotation of a point of the generating curve of the surface
