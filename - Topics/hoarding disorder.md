- a condition in which a person struggles to discard useless or worn-out possessions, acquires an excessive number of such items, and stores them in a chaotic manner resulting in unmanageable clutter. The items are nearly always of little or no monetary value, although valuable items are often found mixed indiscriminately with the rest. Hoarding disorder was included in DSM-5 in 2013 as a new disorder and has been considered for introduction in ICD-11.
