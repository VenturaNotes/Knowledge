## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Viewed as an object with direction and magnitude in [[Ordinary Space|ordinary]] three-dimensional space

## Source[^2]
### Angle Between Vectors
- $cos \theta = \frac {\vec u \cdot \vec v}{||\vec u||*||\vec v||}$

## Source[^3]
- A one-dimensional array. In computing, vectors are widely used since the memory is essentially a vector of words. The notation for vectors is determined by the programming language. In this dictionary a bold italic lower-case letter, e.g. v, is used to denote a vector in its entirety, and the corresponding plain italic lower-case letter indexed by a subscript, e.g. $v_{i}$, is used to denote an element of the vector.
- A vector may also be used to express a deficient matrix, in which case it is necessary to distinguish between a row vector and a column vector.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. 
- (1) an animal, usually an insect or a tick, that transmits parasitic microorganisms $\textendash$ and therefore the diseases they cause $\textendash$ from person to person or from infected animals to human beings. Mosquitoes, for example, are vectors of malaria, filariasis, and yellow fever. 
- (2) an agent used to insert a foreign gene or DNA fragment into a bacterial or other cell in genetic engineering and gene therapy. Viruses, especially retroviruses, are often used as vectors: once inside the host cell, the virus can replicate and thus produce copies (clones) of the gene.
