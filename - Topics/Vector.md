## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Viewed as an object with direction and magnitude in [[Ordinary Space|ordinary]] three-dimensional space

## Source[^2]
### Angle Between Vectors
- $cos \theta = \frac {\vec u \cdot \vec v}{||\vec u||*||\vec v||}$

## Source[^3]
- A one-dimensional array. In computing, vectors are widely used since the memory is essentially a vector of words. The notation for vectors is determined by the programming language. In this dictionary a bold italic lower-case letter, e.g. v, is used to denote a vector in its entirety, and the corresponding plain italic lower-case letter indexed by a subscript, e.g. $v_{i}$, is used to denote an element of the vector.
- A vector may also be used to express a deficient matrix, in which case it is necessary to distinguish between a row vector and a column vector.
