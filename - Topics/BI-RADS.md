- (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System) a standardized system of terminology, report organization, assessment, and classification for mammography and ultrasound or MRI of the breast. BI-RADS reporting enables radiologists to communicate results to the referring physician clearly and consistently, with a final assessment and specific management recommendations.
- The success of BI-RADS has inspired several other systems of the same kind: TI-RADS (Thyroid Imaging Reporting and Data System); LI-RADS (Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System); and PI-RADS (Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System).
