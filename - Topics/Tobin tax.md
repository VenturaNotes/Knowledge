- A proposed low-level tax on foreign-exchange dealings. It has been suggested that such a tax could have the effect of restraining destabilizing currency speculation while also raising large sums that could be used to aid developing nations. The tax was first proposed by the US economist James Tobin (1918-2002). In the wake of the global financial crisis of 2008 there has been considerable interest in the idea of implementing a wider Tobin tax in the form of a general Financial Transactions Tax (FTT) or Financial Activities Tax (FAT).

- An excise duty on cross-border currency transactions proposed by James Tobin, the 1981 Nobel Prize winner. Such a tax is supposed to reduce exchange rate fluctuations by discouraging short-term trading; at the same time, with a huge volume of transaction in the currency markets, the tax would generate substantial revenues that could be used for basic human and environmental needs. The term is often used more generally to describe any tax on financial transactions.
