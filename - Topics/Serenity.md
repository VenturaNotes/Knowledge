- The Serenity behavior-driven development (BDD) framework is an open source reporting library that helps software developers write acceptance criteria for automated software testing. This reporting library generates reports that show software development teams a list of the features tested in each test case, the details of the executed tests, and the requirements that were tested. By starting with the test requirements and allowing software tests to be traced back to specific requirements, this solution allows developers to ensure that their software testing needs are met.
