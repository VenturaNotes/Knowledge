- The use of a random mixture of strategies in a game. The choice between two or more strategies on any particular occasion depends on using some randomizing device, such as tossing a coin or rolling a die. An agent using a mixed strategy does not know what their own actions will be on any particular occasion until the randomizing device has been used, but they do know the probability with which different actions will be chosen. The benefit of adopting a mixed strategy is to make it impossible for any opponent to predict a player's actions with certainty, however well they understand the player's psychology.

- $n$. In game theory, a strategy that is chosen with a randomizing device, by assigning a certain probability to each pure strategy. For example, in the children's game of handy-dandy, mentioned by Shakespeare in King Lear (I.iv.94), one player conceals a small object in one fist and the second player guesses left or right. The first player wins if the guess is wrong, and the second if it is right. Any player who chooses according to any deliberate procedure risks being outguessed by the opponent, and for both players, the game-theoretic solution is a randomized 50-50 mixed strategy that assigns equal probabilities to left and right.
