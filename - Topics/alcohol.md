- An organic compound that contains the -OH group bound to a carbon atom. In systematic chemical nomenclature alcohol names end in the suffix -ol. Examples are methanol, $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}$, and ethanol, $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$. Alcohols that have two -OH groups in their molecules are diols (or dihydric alcohols), those with three are triols (or trihydric alcohols), etc.
