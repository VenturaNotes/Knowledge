- $n$. Control and regulation of information in order to influence impression formation or the attitudes or opinions of the people on whom such behavior is targeted. Through impression management one seeks to shape other people's impressions of a person (such as oneself, a friend, or an enemy) or of an event (such as an achievement or a failure). Impression management that is focused on controlling impressions of oneself is called self-presentation.
