The involuntary fanning of the toes when the sole of the foot is stroked with a hard object such as a metal key, observed in normal infants below 2 years of age but considered an abnormal neurological sign in older children and adults, suggestive of a lesion in the corticospinal tract. It is normally replaced around 2 years of age by the plantar response, which is a curling inwards of the toes. The Babinski sign is the presence of the Babinski reflex in a person over 2 years of age, an indication of neurological damage. \[Named after the French neurologist Josef F(rançois) F(élix) Babinski (1857-1932) who is credited with having discovered it]
