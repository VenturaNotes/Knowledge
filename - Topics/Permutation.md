- Combinatorics viewpoint
	- Number of permutations of length "n" from an "m" [[characters|letter]] alphabet is
		- $P(m,n) = m(m-1)(m-2)...(m-n+1)$
			- n is length
			- m is number of characters in alphabet
	- Example
		- How many permutations of 250 objects taken 3 at a time?
		- P(250, 3) = $250(250-1)(250-3+1)$ = $250*249*248$

### Definition
- Order matters
- Formula
	- $_nP_r$ = $\frac {n!}{(n-r)!}$

### Examples
- Given CAT, how many permutations of 2 letters are there?
	- $_3P_2 = 6$
		- CA, CT, AC, AT, TA, TC
- Given CAT, find the total number of permutations
	- Permutations = $n!$ = 3! = 6
		- CAT, CTA, TCA,
