## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The part of a flower situated outside the stamens and carpels. In dicotyledons it consists of two distinct whorls, the outer of sepals (see CALYX) and the inner of petals (see COROLLA). In monocotyledons the two whorls are similar and often brightly coloured. In wind-pollinated flowers both whorls may be reduced or absent. In many horticultural varieties the number of perianth parts is multiplied, but the resulting 'double' flowers are often sterile.
