## Source[^2]
- (pl. epiphyses) The terminal section of a growing bone (especially a long limb bone) in mammals. It is separated from the bone shaft (diaphysis) by cartilage. New bone is produced on the side of the cartilage facing the diaphysis, while new cartilage is produced on the other side of the cartilage disc. When the bone reaches adult length the epiphysis merges with the diaphysis.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Short for epiphysis cerebri, literally a growth on the brain, the rarely used technical name of the pineal gland. \[From Greek epi on + physis growth, from phyein to produce, alluding to its appearance as a pimple on the base of the brain]
