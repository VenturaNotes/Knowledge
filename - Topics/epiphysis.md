## Source[^2]
- (pl. epiphyses) The terminal section of a growing bone (especially a long limb bone) in mammals. It is separated from the bone shaft (diaphysis) by cartilage. New bone is produced on the side of the cartilage facing the diaphysis, while new cartilage is produced on the other side of the cartilage disc. When the bone reaches adult length the epiphysis merges with the diaphysis.
