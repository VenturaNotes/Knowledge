- (1) An accounting scheme for value added tax enabling a taxable person to account for VAT on the basis of amounts paid and received during the period of the VAT return. Relief for bad debts is automatically available under this scheme. In order to qualify for the scheme, expected turnover should not exceed $£ 1.35 \mathrm{M}$ in the next 12 months. A business already in the scheme is allowed a tolerance limit of $£ 1.6 \mathrm{M}$
- (2) (cash-flow accounting) A system of accounting that records only the cash payments and receipts relating to transactions made by a business, rather than when the money is earned or when expenses are incurred, as in accrual accounting. UK legislation does not permit this system of accounting to be used for published accounts.
