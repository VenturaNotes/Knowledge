- $n$. A generic name for a variety of experimental techniques in which a viewer fixates (1) on a point while visual stimuli are flashed briefly in the left or right visual field, and measures of response accuracy and reaction time are taken, in order to study lateralization of brain functions. It is based on the fact that the partial decussation of nerve fibers at the optic chiasm results in each half of the visual field being projected to the opposite-hemisphere primary visual cortex (Area V1). See also HOMONYMOUS HEMIANOPIA, LATERALITY.
