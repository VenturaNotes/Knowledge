- A piecewise polynomial function, defined over a knot sequence, that has local support and is nonnegative (see SPLINE). The B-spline of order $n$ (degree $n-1$ ) is zero everywhere except over the $n$ successive spans$$x_{i-n}<x_{i-n+1}<\ldots<x_{i}$$The importance of B-splines is that any spline can be expressed as a sum of multiples of B-splines, and if a spline of degree $n-1$ is expressed in terms of B-splines, then changing the coefficient of one of the B-splines alters precisely $n$ spans of the curve without affecting its continuity properties.
