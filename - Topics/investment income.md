- (1) A person's income derived from investments. 
- (2) The income of a business derived from its outside investments rather than from its trading activities.
## Source[^2]
- Income received from the interest on government or commercial bonds, from equity share holdings, or from deposits in building societies and other financial intermediaries. Individuals receive investment income both directly from their own holdings of financial assets, and indirectly in the form of payments from pension funds and insurance companies, which in turn derive their income from holding similar assets.
