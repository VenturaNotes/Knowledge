## Source [^1]
- aka linkage editor or linker
- A utility program that combines several separately compiled modules into one, resolving internal references between them. When a program is assembled or compiled, an intermediate form is produced into which it is necessary to incorporate library material containing the implementation of standard routines and procedures, and to add any other modules that may have been supplied by the user, possibly in other high-level languages. The final stages of binding references within the original program to storable address forms appropriate to the hardware is performed by the link editor. See also LINK LOADER, LOADER
