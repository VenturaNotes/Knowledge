- A Gram-negative soil bacterium that infects a wide range of plants and causes tumorous growths (galls), especially at the root/stem junction (crown gall). It is of interest because the bacterial cells contain a plasmid, the Ti plasmid (tumourinducing plasmid), a segment of which is transferred to cells of the plant host. This T-DNA (transfer DNA) segment, which comprises the genes responsible for the tumorous growth, becomes integrated into the genome of infected plant cells. Possession of the Ti plasmid has made $A$. tumefaciens an important tool in genetic engineering for the introduction of foreign genes into plant tissue. The tumour-inducing genes are usually replaced with the gene of interest, and a marker gene (e.g. the antibiotic resistance gene) is added to enable selection of transformed cells.
