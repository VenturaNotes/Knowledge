- $n$. (in obstetrics) an abnormal position of the fetal head when this is the presenting part in labour (see PRESENTATION). The head is in such a position that the diameter of the skull in relation to the pelvic opening is greater than normal (e.g. occipital transverse, occipital posterior: see OCCIPUT). This is likely to result in a prolonged and complicated labor.
