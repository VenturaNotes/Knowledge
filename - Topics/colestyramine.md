It is used to relieve conditions due to irritant effects of bile salts (such as the itching that occurs in obstructive jaundice), to treat diarrhoea, and to lower the blood levels of cholesterol and other fats in patients with hyperlipidaemia. Common side-effects include constipation, heartburn, and nausea.
