- A list of items in order. Thus the items are organized in such a way that they can be counted, and for each nonnegative integer $i$ within an appropriate range there is a unique item associated with it. An enumeration may be finite or infinite; when an infinite set is involved, the infinite set must be countable. An enumeration is said to be effective if there is an algorithm for producing the enumeration.
- Enumeration is used to define data types in languages of the Pascal and Jovial families. It also plays a significant role in combinatorics where one might typically talk of an enumeration of permutations or combinations, of binary trees, of graphs, of groups, etc.
