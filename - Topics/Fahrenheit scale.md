- A temperature scale in which (by modern definition) the temperature of boiling water is taken as 212 degrees and the temperature of melting ice as 32 degrees. It was invented in 1714 by the German scientist G. D. Fahrenheit (1686-1736), who set the zero at the lowest temperature he knew how to obtain in the laboratory (by mixing ice and common salt) and took his own body temperature as $96^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$. The scale is no longer in scientific use. To convert to the Celsius scale the formula is $$C = 5(F-32)/9$$
