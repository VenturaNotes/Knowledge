- (Hicksian demand) Demand for a good expressed as a function of prices and utility. Compensated demand functions are obtained by the minimization of expenditure subject to the achievement of a given level of utility. Assume there are two goods consumed in quantities $x_{1}$ and $x_{2}$ with prices $p_{1}$ and $p_{2}$. Represent the preferences of the consumer by the utility function $U\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right)$. The compensated demand functions for the two goods are obtained as the solution to $$\min p_{1} x_{1}+p_{2} x_{2} \text { subject to } U\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right) \geq U$$where $U$ is the utility level that must be achieved. The structure of the minimization shows that the compensated demand functions can be written in the form $x_{i}=h_{i}\left(p_{1}, p_{2}, U\right), i=1,2$. See also MARSHALLIAN DEMAND.
