- $n$. rapid involuntary movements of the eyes, which may be from side to side, up and down, rotatory, or a mixture. Nystagmus may be congenital and associated with poor sight; it also occurs in disorders of the part of the brain responsible for eye movements and their coordination (e.g. multiple sclerosis) and in disorders of the organ of balance in the ear or the associated parts of the brain. Certain drugs, especially in excessive doses (e.g. phenytoin), also cause nystagmus. Optokinetic nystagmus occurs in normal people when they try to look at a succession of objects moving quickly across their line of sight. Jerking eye movements sometimes occur in normal people when tired, on concentrating their gaze in any direction. These are called nystagmoid jerks and they do not imply disease.
