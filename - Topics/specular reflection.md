- Reflection from a glossy surface. Many real surfaces are not matte but reflect light, i.e. are glossy; the surfaces of billiard balls, apples, and china are glossy while mirrors are an extreme case, being perfect specular reflectors. If the surface is not a perfect mirror, the reflected light will occur in a cone centered around the perfect reflection direction. The amount of light reflected will be some fraction of the incident light. The result is a highlight that has the color of the light source rather than of the object. An empirical formula suggested by Bui Tuong Phong in 1975 is often used in computer graphics to define specular reflection. Compare DIFFUSE REFLECTION.

- (in ultrasonics) the reflection of sound waves from the surface of an internal structure, which can be used to produce a picture of the surface as a sonogram (see ULTRASONOGRAPHY). A specular reflection contrasts with vaguer diffuse echoes produced by minor differences in tissue density.
