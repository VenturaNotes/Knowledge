## Source[^2]
- Describing a nucleus, cell, or organism that has three times ($3 n$) the haploid number (n) of chromosomes (see also polyploid). Triploid organisms are normally sterile because one-third of their chromosomes will lack partners, and so are unable to pair during meiosis. This can be useful to plant breeders, for example in banana cultivation: sterile triploid bananas can be propagated asexually and will not contain any seeds.
