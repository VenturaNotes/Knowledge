- An activity stream refers to a series of texts or other notifications found in a centralized form of social media. They display summary information of the activity of other users, including comments they have made or media they have shared. Activity streams can be useful in monitoring the progress or comments of friends or followers.
	- #question What does an activity stream look like? 
### #comment
- An activity stream is used in social media to display a timeline of activities such as comments, shares, and media interactions.
- The content of an activity stream may contain comments, media shares, likes, and other interactions
	- #question What other interactions could there be?
- Activity streams benefit users by providing a real-time overview of the activities of others
- A technical challenge in building an activity stream is sorting and filtering large volumes of user activities in real-time
- A centralized activity stream means all content is hosted in one central server
- In a large-scale system, the architectural pattern which might be used to efficiently handle activity streams for millions of users would be a microservices architecture with distributed caching
- When designing an activity stream API, it would be important to consider providing real-time data and updates for users. 
- An activity stream benefits a software development process by providing feedback and progress updates to team members
	- #question I don't understand, what does this mean? 
- To paginate an activity stream means to load a limited number of items at once and allow navigation through multiple pages
- The database system most commonly used to store activity stream data would be NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, which can scale easily and store unstructured data
- A software engineer ensures that an activity stream remains responsive under heavy traffic by using load balancing and horizontal scaling to distribute the load across multiple servers
- The role caching plays in improving performance of an activity stream is that caching can store frequently accessed data temporarily, reducing database queries and improving load times
- A potential issue when designing an activity stream for social media platforms would be overloading the user interface with too much information. 
- Activity filters and sorting options are features in an activity stream which are often used to help users find relevant content
