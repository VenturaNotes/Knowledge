- A rule which assigns to a single element of the domain more than one element in the range. Consequently, any such assignment is not a function. For example, $tan^{-1}x$ takes not only the principal value, $\alpha$, lying between $-90\degree$ and $+90\degree$, but also $\alpha \pm$ $180n$ for any integer $n$. See MULTIFUNCTION
