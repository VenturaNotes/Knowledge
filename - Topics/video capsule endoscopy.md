- (VCE) an investigation for visualizing the intestinal lining (mucosa). A capsule containing a miniature digital video camera is swallowed by the patient and passively propelled through the intestine by peristalsis. The images are uploaded to a computer for subsequent analysis. Various capsules are available for investigation of oesophageal, small-intestinal, and colonic disorders. The commonest in use is the small-intestinal capsule, for investigation of obscure gastrointestinal bleeding, recurrent iron-deficiency anaemia, or in cases of suspected Crohn's disease, coeliac disease, or small-bowel tumors.
