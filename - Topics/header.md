- A header in networking is a section of data at the beginning of a packet that contains information about the packet
- Headers are important for reliable data transmission and network communication 

## Source[^2]
- Some coded information that precedes a more general collection of data and gives details about it.
- The header of a data-structure representation is logically distinct from the data elements themselves and may serve several purposes:
	- (a) to hold global information about the whole structure, e.g. list length, array index bounds;
	- (b) to represent an empty structure;
	- (c) to provide links into the structure, e.g. pointers to first and last nodes in a list;
	- (d) to represent the entire structure in any other data structures of which it may be a part. 
- In networking, the header (or head) of a cell or packet is the part that holds routing and control information used to control the passage of the cell or packet across a network.
