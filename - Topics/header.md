- A header in networking is a section of data at the beginning of a packet that contains information about the packet
- Headers are important for reliable data transmission and network communication 

## Source[^2]
- Some coded information that precedes a more general collection of data and gives details about it.
- The header of a data-structure representation is logically distinct from the data elements themselves and may serve several purposes:
	- (a) to hold global information about the whole structure, e.g. list length, array index bounds;
	- (b) to represent an empty structure;
	- (c) to provide links into the structure, e.g. pointers to first and last nodes in a list;
	- (d) to represent the entire structure in any other data structures of which it may be a part. 
- In networking, the header (or head) of a cell or packet is the part that holds routing and control information used to control the passage of the cell or packet across a network.
## Source[^3]
- The term header, in the computer science industry, refers to the supplemental information within a data packet (a unit of data that travels along a computer network). A header precedes the actual data within a data packet, providing the important information needed for data transmission. Headers typically include addressing information, routing information, and the protocol version that should be used to transmit the data packet. Headers help control the flow of data packets over a network, so that they can effectively be transmitted from system to system.
