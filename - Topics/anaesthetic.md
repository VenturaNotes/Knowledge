- (1) n. an agent that reduces or abolishes sensation, affecting either the whole body (general anaesthetic) or a particular area or region (local anaesthetic). General anaesthetics, used for surgical procedures, depress activity of the central nervous system, producing loss of consciousness. Anaesthesia is induced by intravenous anaesthetics, such as thiopental, etomidate, or propofol, and maintained by inhalation anaesthetics (such as sevoflurane). Local anaesthetics inhibit conduction of impulses in sensory nerves in the region where they are injected or applied; they include tetracaine, bupivacaine, and lidocaine. 
- (2) adj. reducing or abolishing sensation.
