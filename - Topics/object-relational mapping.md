## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A programming technique for converting data between incompatible type systems in object-oriented programming languages. It creates a “virtual object database” that can be used within the programming language.

## Source[^2]
- The conversion of data held in objects to a form that can be stored in a relational database and vice versa. This is a common activity; many programs need to persist their data and using a relational database is often an appropriate way to do this. However, the strict rules of relational database design mean that mapping the more flexible data structures natural to object-oriented languages onto a database can be an intricate and time-consuming operation. Software packages exist that create the necessary code automatically, the result being in effect an object-oriented database. See also OBJECT-RELATIONAL DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM.
