- (pl. pupae) The third stage of development in the life cycle of endopterygote insects. During the pupal stage locomotion and feeding cease and metamorphosis from the larva to the adult form takes place. There are three types of pupa. The commonest is the exarate or free pupa, in which the wings and other appendages are visible and movable. In the obtect type the wings are stuck to the body and immovable, as in the chrysalis of a butterfly or moth; and in the co-arctate type an exarate pupa develops within a hard barrel-shaped puparium, as in the housefly and other Diptera.
