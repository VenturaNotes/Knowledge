- (diffeomorphic) Two open subsets (see OPEN SET) $U$ and $V$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ are diffeomorphic if there is a diffeomorphism $\varphi: U \to V$ between them, that is a bijection such that both $\varphi$ and its inverse $\varphi ^{-1}$ are differentiable. These ideas then generalize to manifolds and subspaces of manifolds. See also DIFFERENTIAL, TRANSITION MAP; compare HOMEOMORPHISM.
