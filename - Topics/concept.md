- $n$. A mental representation, idea, or thought corresponding to a specific entity or class of entities, or the defining or prototypical features (1) of the entity or class, which may be either concrete or abstract. The traditional psychological definition is a category that divides some domain into positive and negative instances. According to some authorities, to qualify as a concept the mental process must be conscious: young children do not have concepts of noun or verb although their linguistic behavior shows that they understand these concepts and can discriminate between them. According to evidence, people can form concepts without awareness: in 1920 the US psychologist Clark L(eonard) Hull (1884-1952) reported one of the earliest experiments on concept formation in which participants or subjects sorted Chinese characters into two categories with the help of simple right/wrong feedback, the concept being based on the presence or absence of a certain radical element, but even after learning to sort the elements more or less correctly, some people were unable to describe or draw the defining attribute. See also basiC-LEVEL CATEGORY, COMPONENTIAL THEORY, CONJUNCTIVE CONCEPT, CONSTRUCT, DISJUNCTIVE CONCEPT, EXEMPLAR, INTENSION, INTUITION, PROTOTYPE THEORY. conceptual adj. Of, relating to, or based on a concept or concepts. \[From Latin conceptum something received or conceived, from concipere to take in or conceive, from con- with + capere, ceptum to take]
