- $n$. a medicinal preparation in solid form suitable for insertion into the rectum, vagina, or urethra. Rectal suppositories may contain simple lubricants (e.g. glycerin); drugs that act locally in the rectum or anus (e.g. corticosteroids, local anaesthetics); or drugs that are absorbed and act at other sites (e.g. analgesics, such as diclofenac). Vaginal suppositories are used in the treatment of some gynaecological disorders (see PESSARY). Urethral suppositories contain antibiotics, local anaesthetics (prior to a procedure), or medication used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction.
