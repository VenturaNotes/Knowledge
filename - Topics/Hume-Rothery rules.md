## Synthesis

- A set of empirical rules put forward in 1926 by William Hume-Rothery to describe when one metal can dissolve in another metal to form a solid solution. One metallic element will not dissolve in another metallic element if the difference between their atomic radii is more than about 15% or if the electronegativities of the elements are substantially different. A metal with a lower valence is more likely to dissolve in a metal of higher valence than vice versa. These rules are very similar to Goldschmidt’s rules for minerals, which were proposed in the same year. See also isomorphous substitution.
