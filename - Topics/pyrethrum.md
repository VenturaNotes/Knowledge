- (1) Any of several plants of the genus Chrysanthemum, especially C. cinerariifolium, grown for its flowers and seed cases, which contain natural insecticidal compounds (pyrethrins). Various synthetic insecticides$\textemdash$the pyrethroids$\textemdash$are chemically similar to pyrethrins. Examples include permethrin and cypermethrin. The pyrethrins penetrate the insect's cuticle and are fast-acting, nontoxic to many animals (although fish are highly susceptible) and to plants, and readily biodegradable. 
- (2) An insecticidal preparation containing natural pyrethrins.
