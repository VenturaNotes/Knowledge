- An inactive period in the life of an animal or plant during which growth slows or completely ceases. Physiological changes associated with dormancy help the organism survive adverse environmental conditions. Annual plants survive the winter as dormant seeds while many perennial plants survive as dormant tubers, rhizomes, or bulbs. Hibernation and aestivation in animals help them survive extremes of cold and heat, respectively. See also DIAPAUSE.
