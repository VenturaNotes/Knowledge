- $n$. a malignant tumor of the cervix, uterus, or vagina containing a mixture of adenocarcinoma and cells with a sarcoma appearance, previously called malignant mixed MÃ¼llerian tumors (MMMT). These tumors are actually epithelial in origin and should be treated as high-grade adenocarcinomas. Sarcomatoid differentiation of epithelial cancers often indicates a poor prognosis.
