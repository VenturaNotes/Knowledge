- $n$. in medical ethics, the principle that cases with an equal moral status should be treated equally. This means, most obviously, that patients with the same clinical needs should not be treated differently on morally irrelevant grounds, such as race (see DISCRIMINATION), and are afforded identical rights, respect, and value. However, there is much debate over what characteristics are morally important when medical resources need to be rationed; for example, whether a patient's age or quality of life is morally important. See JUSTICE.
