- (pl. hemipenes) Either of the paired male sex organs of snakes and lizards (i.e. Squamata). The hemipenes are contained inverted within the tail and are used alternately during repeated copulations. They are everted by means of erectile tissue, and sperm passes along a seminal groove to enter the female. Some have ridges, hooks, or spines to anchor the hemipenis inside the female for extended periods to ensure fertilization takes place.
