- $n$. the part of the eye that regulates the amount of light that enters. It forms a colored muscular diaphragm across the front of the lens; light enters through a central opening, the pupil. A ring of muscle round the margin contracts in bright light, causing the pupil to become smaller (see PUPILLARY REFLEX). In dim light a set of radiating muscles contract and the constricting muscles relax, increasing the size of the pupil. The outer margin of the iris is attached to the ciliary body.

- The pigmented ring of muscular tissue, lying between the cornea and the lens, in the eyes of vertebrates and some cephalopod molluscs. It has a central hole (the pupil) through which light enters the eye and it contains both circular and radial muscles. Reflex contraction of the former occurs in bright light to reduce the diameter of the pupil (see pupillary reflex); contraction of the radial muscles in dim light increases the pupil diameter and therefore the amount of light entering the eye. Color is determined by the amount of the pigment melanin in the iris. Blue eyes result from relatively little melanin; grey and brown eyes from increasingly larger amounts.

- $n$. The opaque contractile diaphragm suspended in aqueous humour between the cornea and the crystalline lens of the eye, surrounding and controlling the variable diameter of the pupil, attached around its rim to the ciliary body, its deeply pigmented appearance determining the color of the eye, containing the dilator pupillae muscle that contracts the iris and thus dilates the pupil and the sphincter pupillae muscle that expands the iris and thus constricts the pupil.
