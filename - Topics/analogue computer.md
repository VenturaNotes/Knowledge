## Source [^1]
- A computer that performs computations (such as summation, multiplication, integration, and other operations) by manipulating continuous physical variables that are analogues of the quantities being subjected to computation. The most commonly used physical variables are voltage and time. Some analogue computers use mechanical components: the physical variables become, for example, angular rotations and linear displacements. See also DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS.
