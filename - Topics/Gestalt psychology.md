- $n$. A school of psychology concerned largely with emergent Gestalt phenomena in perception. Its forerunners were the German poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe (1749-1832), the Austrian physicist, philosopher, and psychologist Ernst Mach (1838-1916), and especially the German philosopher Christian von Ehrenfels (1859-1932), but the emergence of the school is usually traced to 1912 and the publication of a seminal article on apparent movement by the German psychologist Max Wertheimer (1880-1943). The school was transplanted to the US with the rise of Nazism in Germany, as Wertheimer emigrated there together with the other founding German psychologists Kurt Koffka (1886-1941), Wolfgang Köhler (1887-1967), and Kurt Lewin (1890-1947). The cardinal principles of Gestalt psychology are the primary importance in psychology of subjective experience and of its forms and structures, and a rejection of elementalism.
