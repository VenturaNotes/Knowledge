- $n$. a vitamin of the B complex that is an essential coenzyme for several carboxylase enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids. A biotin deficiency is extremely rare in humans; it can be induced by eating large quantities of raw egg white, which contains a protein - avidin - that combines with biotin, making it unavailable to the body. Rich sources of the vitamin are egg yolk and liver. There are no known reports of biotin toxicity.
