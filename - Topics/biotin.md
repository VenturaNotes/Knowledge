- $n$. a vitamin of the B complex that is an essential coenzyme for several carboxylase enzymes involved in fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis, and the metabolism of branched-chain amino acids. A biotin deficiency is extremely rare in humans; it can be induced by eating large quantities of raw egg white, which contains a protein - avidin - that combines with biotin, making it unavailable to the body. Rich sources of the vitamin are egg yolk and liver. There are no known reports of biotin toxicity.

- (vitamin $\mathbf{B}_{7}$) A vitamin in the vitamin B complex. It is the coenzyme for various enzymes that catalyse the synthesis of fat, glycogen, and amino acids. Adequate amounts are normally produced by the intestinal bacteria in animals although deficiency can be induced by consuming large amounts of raw egg white. This contains a protein, avidin, that specifically binds biotin, preventing its absorption from the gut. Other sources of biotin include cereals, vegetables, milk, and liver. Symptoms of deficiency include skin inflammation and neuromuscular disorders.
