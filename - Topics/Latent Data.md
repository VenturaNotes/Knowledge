- Latent data, commonly referred to as ambient data, is computer data that is not viewable, and often no longer used by an end user through an operating system or a standard computer program. Typically, this type of data includes various deleted files and folders, slack space, memory dumps, printer spool files and temporary cache. Latent data is often used when a computer is prompted to recover lost data files or uncover malicious computer activity. Computer forensics experts often use latent data to uncover and rid systems of malware, whereas company employees often use latent data to retrieve accidentally deleted data.
