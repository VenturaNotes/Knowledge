- (glycosylated haemoglobin) any derivative of haemoglobin in which a glucose molecule is attached to the haemoglobin molecule. The most abundant form of glycated haemoglobin is haemoglobin $A_{1 \mathrm{c}}\left(\mathbf{H b A}_{1 \mathrm{c}}\right)$, levels of which are significantly increased in diabetes. The percentage of the HbA molecules that become glycated is dependent on the general level of glucose in the plasma over the lifetime of the molecule (generally three months); this percentage is therefore used as the standard measure of the degree of control of hyperglycaemia in a person with diabetes over this period. $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ values are now expressed in mmol per mol haemoglobin ( $\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{mol}$ ) rather than as a percentage. The use of $\mathrm{HbA}_{1 \mathrm{c}}$ as a screening tool for diabetes mellitus has become recognized.
