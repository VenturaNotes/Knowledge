- A type of response that may be either complete and of full intensity or totally absent, depending on the strength of the stimulus; there is no partial response. For example, when the membrane potential of a nerve cell exceeds a certain threshold, the cell transmits a complete nervous impulse, but otherwise no impulse occurs; a stinging thread cell of a cnidarian is either completely discharged or it is not.
