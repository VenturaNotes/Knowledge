- $n$. trade name for an airway support device, initially designed for use by relatively untrained personnel on the battlefield, that is referred to in modern hospital resuscitation guidelines but rarely used. The device has two tubes and is introduced through the mouth blindly into the back of the throat. It may end up in either the oesophagus or the airway: ventilation is provided either through the hole in the end of the tracheal tube or via perforations in the side of the oesophageal tube.
