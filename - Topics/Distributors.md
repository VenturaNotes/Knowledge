- Distributors are entities that buy a large number of products from a manufacturer with the intent of distributing them to customers. Distributors can either sell the products directly to customers or partner with retailers, who sell the products to their customers.
- Typically, distributors earn revenue by buying huge quantities of discounted products from the manufacturers and selling them directly to customers or retailers at an inflated price. Distributors are an important part of the supply chain because they help manufacturers sell their products to a wider customer base.
