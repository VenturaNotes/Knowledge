- The deep web, otherwise known as the invisible or hidden web, is the part of the World Wide Web in which contents are not indexed by search engines. Therefore, web users cannot use popular search engines to access deep web content. Deep web content is typically hidden behind login forms, as it often includes unindexed web content, private databases, the dark web, and paywalled websites. It is estimated that search engines only index less than 1% of all of the internet ªs content.
