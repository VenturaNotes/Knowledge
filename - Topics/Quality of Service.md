- Quality of service (QoS) is a measure of the performance of an information or communication system, particularly in terms of how well it meets the needs of its users. QoS is generally concerned with factors like throughput, latency, reliability, and jitter. It's often used to manage network traffic and ensure that high-priority applications receive the bandwidth they need to function correctly.
