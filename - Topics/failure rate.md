- The number of failures of a specified category in a given period, in a given number of computer runs, or in some other given unit of measure. The failure rate of a system or component varies during its lifetime, at first decreasing as problems are detected and repaired and finally increasing due to deterioration. Between these two periods the failure rate usually remains relatively steady.
