## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A type of point mutation that converts a codon normally specifying an amino acid to one of the stop codons, thus signalling termination of translation and causing synthesis of the polypeptide chain to cease prematurely.
## Source[^2]
- n. Any mutation that produces one of the stop codons, causing premature termination of protein synthesis by the gene in which it occurs. \[So called because a stop codon is also called a nonsense codon]
