- The termination of a contract as a result of an unforeseen event that makes its performance impossible or illegal. A contract to sell an aircraft could be frustrated if it crashed before the contract was due to be implemented. Similarly an export contract could be frustrated if the importer was in a country that declared war on the country of the exporter.
