- A soft tissue contained within the central cavity and internal spaces of a bone. At birth and in young animals the marrow of all bones is concerned with the formation of blood cells: it contains haemopoietic tissue and is known as red marrow . In mature animals the marrow of the long bones ceases producing blood cells and is replaced by fat, being known as yellow marrow.
