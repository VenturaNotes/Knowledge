## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A gamete is a reproductive cell of an animal or plant. 
- In animals, female gametes are called ova or eggs and male gametes are called sperm
- Ova and sperm are haploid cells, with each cell carrying only one copy of each chromosome
- During fertilization, a sperm and ovum unite to form a new [[diploid]] organism
## Source[^2]
- A sex cell; either an egg or a sperm
## Source[^3]
- $n$. a mature sex cell: the ovum of the female or the spermatozoon of the male. Gametes are haploid, containing half the normal number of chromosomes.
## Source[^4]
- A reproductive cell that fuses with another gamete to form a zygote. Examples of gametes are ova and spermatozoa. Gametes are haploid, i.e. they contain half the normal (diploid) number of chromosomes; thus when two fuse, the diploid number is restored (see FERTILIZATION). Gametes are formed by meiosis. Gametes often differ in size, the smaller (usually male) gamete being known as the microgamete and the larger (usually female) as the macrogamete. See also SEXUAL REPRODUCTION.
## Source[^5]
- $n$. A sexual reproductive cell, such as an ovum or a spermatozoon, that fuses with another during fertilization. Also called a germ cell. \[From Greek gamete a wife and gametes a husband, from gameein to marry]
