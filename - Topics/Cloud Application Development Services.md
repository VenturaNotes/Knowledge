- Cloud Application Development (AD) is a type of service that helps businesses develop and deploy cloud-based applications. It includes all aspects of the process, such as design, architecture, development, testing, and deployment, so that companies can have everything they need to get their app up and running in the shortest amount of time possible. With constant improvements in cloud technology, it's more important than ever for businesses to have a cloud-based application. One of the most significant advantages of CAD is that it allows companies to scale up as needed without incurring additional costs associated with new infrastructure investments.
