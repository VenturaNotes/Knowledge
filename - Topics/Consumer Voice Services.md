- Consumer voice services are analog or digital telecommunication connections provided to end-users. Traditionally, phones calls have been made through a public switched telephone network (PSTN) or landline phone. Voice calls through the Internet or other IP networks are made through voice over IP (VoIP) connections. Both require an associated telephone number.
