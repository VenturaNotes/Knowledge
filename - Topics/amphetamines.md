- pl. n. a group of sympathomimetic drugs that have a marked stimulant action on the central nervous system, alleviating fatigue and producing a feeling of mental alertness and wellbeing. Dexamfetamine (dexamphetamine) is used in the treatment of narcolepsy and in selected cases of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in children. Side-effects include insomnia and restlessness. Tolerance to amphetamines develops rapidly, and prolonged use may lead to dependence; these drugs should not be used to treat depressive illness or obesity.
