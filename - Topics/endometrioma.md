- n. a complex ovarian cyst, usually with 'chocolateâ€™ material (altered blood) inside and associated with endometriosis. A history of cyclical enlargement of the nodule and painful periods is highly suggestive. There is a characteristic ground-glass appearance on transvaginal ultrasound and these cysts may be associated with a raised CA125 level. Endometriomas are not amenable to medical therapy and should be surgically excised.
