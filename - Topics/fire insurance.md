- An insurance policy covering financial losses caused by damage to property by fires. Most fire insurance policies also include cover for damage caused by lightning and explosions of boilers or gas used for domestic purposes. On payment of an additional premium, fire insurers are usually prepared to widen the cover to include such special perils as those arising from various weather-related or man-made causes.
