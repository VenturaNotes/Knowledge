- The amount of change over a period in some of the financial characteristics of a company, such as sales revenue or profits. It is normally measured in percentage terms and can be compared to the Retail Price Index, or some other measure of inflation, to assess the real performance of the company.

- The proportional or percentage rate of increase of any economic variable over a unit period, usually a year. If a variable measured over discrete time intervals grows from 1 to $1+x$, this is a proportional growth rate of $x$, or a percentage growth rate of $100 x$. If working in continuous time, a continuous constant growth rate $g$ means that a variable grows from 1 at time 0 to $e^{g t}$ at time $t$. If $y_{t}=y_{0} e^{g t}, d y_{t} / d t=g y_{0} e^{g t}$, and $\left(d y_{t} / d t\right) / y_{t}=g$. As $\ln \left(y_{t}\right)=\ln \left(y_{0}\right)+g t, d \ln \left(y_{t}\right) / d t=g$; the rate of change of the natural logarithm of any variable equals its growth rate. See also NATURAL GROWTH RATE; WARRANTED GROWTH RATE.
