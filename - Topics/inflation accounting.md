- Any method of accounting that, unlike historical-cost accounting, attempts to take account of the fact that a monetary unit (e.g. the pound sterling) does not have a constant value; because of the effects of inflation, successive accounts expressed in that unit do not necessarily give a fair view of the trend of profits. The principal methods of dealing with inflation have been current-cost accounting and current purchasing power accounting.

- The production of meaningful company accounts under inflationary conditions. During inflation, depreciation allowances on capital goods based on historical cost do not provide for their replacement, and thus overstate profits, and increases in the prices of inventories also produce paper profits in excess of real ones. On the other hand, if interest rates increase in response to inflation, counting nominal interest payments as costs but taking no credit for the decrease in the real value of a firm's debts understates true profits. There are also difficulties if the prices of a firm's capital goods, inventories, or output change at different rates from the general price level.
