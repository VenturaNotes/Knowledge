- $n$. a rigid or flexible instrument that can be passed into the ureter and up into the pelvis of the kidney. It is most commonly used to visualize a stone in the ureter and remove it safely under direct vision with a stone basket or forceps. Larger stones need to be fragmented before removal with an ultrasound probe, lithoclast, or lasers. Ureteroscopy can also be used to visualize tumors in the ureter, and a flexible ureteroscope can be passed into the kidney to visualize and treat tumors or stones.
