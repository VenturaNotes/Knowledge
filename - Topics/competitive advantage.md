- An advantage a firm possesses over its competitors. There are numerous sources of competitive advantage, including more efficient production techniques, brand image, consumer loyalty, and location. Possession of a competitive advantage should deliver a firm a higher level of profit than obtained by its rivals.
## Source[^2]
- An advantage over competitors gained by offering consumers greater value, either by means of lower prices or by providing greater benefits and better servicing facilities that could justify higher prices. This advantage may be achieved in various ways, including increased product performance, superior distribution methods, or creative advertising. Most forms of competitive advantage cannot be sustained in the longer term because competitors will initiate or find substitutes for the innovations that created it. A firm is said to have sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) when it has resources that cannot readily be imitated or substituted (see CORE COMPETENCY; RESOURCE-BASED VIEW).
