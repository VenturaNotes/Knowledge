- bleeding from a cerebral blood vessel into the tissue of the brain. It is commonly caused by degenerative disease of the arteries and high blood pressure but it may result from bleeding from congenital abnormalities of blood vessels. The extent and severity of the symptoms depend upon the site and volume of the haemorrhage; they vary from a transient weakness or numbness to profound coma and death. See also ATHEROMA; HYPERTENSION; STROKE.
