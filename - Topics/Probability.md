- A number between 0 and 1 associated with an event (see RELATIVE FREQUENCY) that is one of a set of possible events: an event that is certain to occur has probability 1 . The probability of an event is the limiting value approached by the relative frequency of the event as the number of observations is increased indefinitely. Alternatively it is the degree of belief that the event will occur.
- The concept of probability is applied to a wide range of events in different contexts. Originally interest was in the study of games of chance, where correct knowledge of probability values allowed profitable wagers to be made. Later the subject was studied by insurance companies anxious to predict probable future claims on the basis of previously observed relative frequencies. Today probability theory is the basis of statistical analysis (see STATISTICAL METHODS).
- The probability calculus is the set of rules for combining probabilities for combinations of events, using the methods of symbolic logic applied to sets.
