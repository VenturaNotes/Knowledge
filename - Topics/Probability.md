- A number between 0 and 1 associated with an event (see RELATIVE FREQUENCY) that is one of a set of possible events: an event that is certain to occur has probability 1 . The probability of an event is the limiting value approached by the relative frequency of the event as the number of observations is increased indefinitely. Alternatively it is the degree of belief that the event will occur.
- The concept of probability is applied to a wide range of events in different contexts. Originally interest was in the study of games of chance, where correct knowledge of probability values allowed profitable wagers to be made. Later the subject was studied by insurance companies anxious to predict probable future claims on the basis of previously observed relative frequencies. Today probability theory is the basis of statistical analysis (see STATISTICAL METHODS).
- The [[probability calculus]] is the set of rules for combining probabilities for combinations of events, using the methods of symbolic logic applied to sets.

- Probability is the branch of mathematics that deals with numerical descriptions of the likelihood that an event will occur, or how likely it is that a proposition is truthful. The probability of an event is a number between zero and one. Zero indicates the impossibility that an event will occur and one indicates certainty that the event will occur. The formula used to calculate the probability of a single event occurring is (P = n / N), which means the probability (P) of an event occurring equals the number of ways an event can occur (n) divided by the total number of possible outcomes (N). The formula used to calculate the probability of multiple events occurring is P(A and B) = P(A) x P(B),which means the probability of both A and B events occurring (P(A and B)) is equal to the probability of event A occurring (P(A)) multiplied by the probability of event B occurring (P(B)).
## Source[^4]
- The likelihood that an event or a particular result will occur. It can be represented on a scale by a number between 0 (zero probability of the event happening, i.e. it is certain not to) and 1 (certainty that it will occur). It is treated mathematically on this basis in statistics.
## Source[^5]
- (of a random event) A quantitative measure of the chance that a random event will occur, expressed by a number between 0 and 1 . The probability is 0 if the event is certain not to occur, and 1 if it is certain to occur.
## Source[^6]
- $n$. A measure or index of degree of certainty regarding the occurrence of an event, on a scale from zero (indicating impossibility) to 1 (indicating certainty), interpreted as the relative frequency of the event (in classical statistics) or as one's subjective belief regarding the likelihood of the event (in Bayesian inference). Probabilities are nowadays usually assumed to obey Kolmogorov's axioms. The theory of probability is the foundation on which the whole of statistics is constructed. \[From Latin probabilis that may be proved, from probare to prove + -abilitas capacity, from habilis able]
