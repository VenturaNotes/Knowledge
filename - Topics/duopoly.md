- A market in which there are only two producers or sellers of a particular product or service and many buyers. The profits in such an imperfect form of competition are in practice usually less than could be achieved if the two suppliers merged to form a monopoly but more than if the two allowed competition to force them into marginal costing. See also COLLUSIVE DUOPOLY.
