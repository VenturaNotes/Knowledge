- The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (SOX) is a federal law passed by the United States Congress. The act is designed to protect investors from corporations with fraudulent financial reports. It was put in place in response to Enron and similar scandals of the 2000s. The law requires stricter record-keeping and penalties for lawbreakers. In addition, corporate whistleblowers receive protection when reporting illegal activities.
