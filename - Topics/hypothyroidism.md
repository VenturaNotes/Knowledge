- $n$. subnormal activity of the thyroid gland. If present at birth and untreated it leads to cretinism. When acquired in later life it causes mental and physical slowing, undue sensitivity to cold, slowing of the pulse, weight gain, and coarsening of the skin (myxoedema). Treatment is by thyroid hormone replacement therapy, usually in the form of thyroxine. Primary hypothyroidism is due to intrinsic underactivity of the thyroid gland; secondary hypothyroidism is reduced stimulation of the gland caused by a deficiency of thyroid-stimulating hormone due to disease of the pituitary gland.

- Underactivity of the thyroid gland, which is generally due to a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone. In adults hypothyroidism causes a decrease in basal metabolic rate, with tissue swelling and weight gain (myxoedema). In children thyroid hormone is required for development of the bones and nervous system, and hypothyroidism can result in cretinism. Compare HYPERTHYROIDISM.
