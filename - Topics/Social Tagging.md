- (Folksonomy)
- Social tagging, or folksonomy, refers to the collection of user metadata. Folksonomies are not intentionally designed communities. Instead, they tend to evolve naturally over time. For instance, individuals and businesses use websites or social media platforms to upload data or create hashtags. In so doing, they form a naturally-created community that tends to revolve around a specific item, product, or interest. The content of the folksonomy is not set and keeps evolvin. It may also be subjected to manipulation by outside actors who want to change the subject.
