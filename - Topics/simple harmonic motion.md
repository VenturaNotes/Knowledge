- Suppose that a particle is moving in a straight line so that its displacement $x$ at time $t$ is given by $x = Asin(\omega t + \alpha)$, where $A > 0, \omega$ and $\alpha$ are constants. Then the particle is exhibiting simple harmonic motion, with amplitude $A$, period $2\pi / \omega$, and phase $\alpha$. This equation gives the general solution of the differential equation $\ddot x + \omega^2x = 0$.
- An example of simple harmonic motion is the motion of a particle suspended from a fixed support by a spring (see Hooke's Law). Also, the motion of a simple pendulum performing oscillations of small amplitude is approximately simple harmonic motion.
