Typically, a rat is placed in a long, narrow alleyway with an electrified grid floor and can escape painful stimulation by running to the end of the alley and stepping into a nonelectrified goal box, learning being evidenced by progressively faster running speeds. Also called escape learning. Compare avoidance CONDITIONING.
