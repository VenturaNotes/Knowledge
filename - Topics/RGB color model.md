- A color model that defines color in terms of its red, green, and blue components, known collectively as RGB components. Red, green, and blue light are a set of primary colors: when mixed in equal proportions they produce white light and when mixed in other proportions they produce light of a range of different colors. The RGB model is the usual method of defining color on a cathode-ray tube or other light-emitting display device.
