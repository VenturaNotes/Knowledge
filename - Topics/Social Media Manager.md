- A social media manager is a business professional that corporations often hire to oversee and maintain their company profile and feed on social media platforms. Social media managers are tasked with ensuring that social media campaigns launch successfully,  interacting with customers on social media platforms on behalf of a business, and furthering a business’s brand awareness. Social media managers are considered a part of an organization's marketing team because they create and execute marketing campaigns, develop a social media marketing strategy, and monitor social media marketing metrics. Businesses hire social media managers to help them get in direct contact with their target customer base so that they can market their products and service offerings more effectively.
