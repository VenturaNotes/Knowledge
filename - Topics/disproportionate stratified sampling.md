- A sampling method in which the size of the sample drawn from a particular stratum is not proportional to the relative size of that stratum. For example, a stratum could be large supermarkets, which may only account for $20 \%$ of all grocery stores-although they account for $80 \%$ of grocery sales. In this case, a disproportionate sample would be used to represent the large supermarkets to reflect their sales (i.e. $80 \%$ ) rather than the number of stores. Compare PROPORTIONATE STRATIFIED SAMPLING. See STRATIFIED SAMPLING.
