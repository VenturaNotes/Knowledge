- a deeply ingrained and maladaptive pattern of behaviour, persisting over many years. It is usually manifest by the time the individual is adolescent. The abnormality of behaviour must be sufficiently severe that it causes suffering, either to the patient or to other people (or to both). Some individuals with such personalities mature into people who are less debilitated by their personality development. Certain types of psychotherapy are of some therapeutic value, but treatment is mostly aimed at mitigating the worst consequences of the personality disorder rather than cure. The International Classification of Diseases differs slightly from the DSM in its terminology and clustering of personality disorders. See ANTISOCIAL PERSONALITY DISORDER; AVOIDANT; EMOTIONALLY UNSTABLE PERSONALITY DISORDER; HISTRIONIC PERSONALITY DISORDER; SCHIZOTYPAL PERSONALITY DISORDER.
