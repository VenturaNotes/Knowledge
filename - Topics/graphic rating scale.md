- A technique for evaluating the performance of an employee that can be used as part of the formal appraisal process (see EMPLOYEE EVALUATION; PERFORMANCE APPRAISAL). It involves listing the desirable traits that the jobholder should possess (e.g. integrity, drive, reliability, etc.) and rating (on a 5-7 point scale) each employee for each of these traits. These trait scores can then be aggregated into overall performance scores.
