- A fixed area that an animal or group of animals defends against intrusion from others of its species by various types of territorial behavior. Outside the territory (which may contain food sources, hiding places, and nesting sites) others are not threatened (compare HOME RANGE). Many mammals indicate their territory boundaries with scent markings, while birds sing territorial songs that repel would-be intruders. Animals in neighboring territories normally respect each other's boundaries, which reduces overt aggression. Some animals are territorial only at certain times of the year, usually the breeding season (see COURTSHIP; LEK).
