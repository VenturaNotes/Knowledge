- any one of a rare group of inherited (autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive) disorders of the connective tissue involving abnormal or deficient collagen, the protein that gives the body tissues strength. There are several types of differing severity. The skin of affected individuals is very elastic but also very fragile: it bruises easily and scars poorly, the scars often being paper-thin. The joints of those affected tend to be very mobile (double-jointed) and dislocate easily. In some types the uterus or bowel can rupture or the valves in the heart can be weaker than normal. \[E. L. Ehlers (1863-1937), Danish dermatologist; H. A. Danlos (1844-1912), French dermatologist]
