- Risks on projects where there is no relation between the results of one and those of the other. Let the outcomes of two projects be represented by the random variables $x$ and $y$, with means $\mu_{x}$ and $\mu_{y}$. If the risks are independent then $\mathrm{E}\left[\left(x-\mu_{x}\right)\left(y-\mu_{y}\right)\right]=0$.
