- any sexual behavior regarded as abnormal by society. The deviation may relate to the sexual object (as in fetishism) or the activity engaged in (for example, paedophilia, sadism, and exhibitionism). The activity is sexually pleasurable.
- The definition of what is normal varies with different cultures and over time, and treatment is appropriate only when the deviation causes suffering. For this reason the term sexual variation is now sometimes preferred. Some people may find that counseling helps them to adjust to their deviation. Others may wish for treatment to change the deviation: aversion therapy may be used, also conditioning normal sexual fantasies to pleasurable behavior. The only helpful effect of drugs is to reduce sexual drive generally.
