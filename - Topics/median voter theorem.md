- A result showing that the outcome of majority voting is the option most preferred by the median voter. Assume that a choice has to be made from a set of alternatives that differ in only one dimension (such as a left-right spectrum). The strong form of the theorem states that, if all voters have single-peaked preferences, then the alternative that is the most preferred by the median voter will defeat any other alternative in a pairwise majority vote. The weak form of the theorem states that the median voter always votes for the winning alternative. See also CITIZEN CANDIDATE MODEL; VOTING.
