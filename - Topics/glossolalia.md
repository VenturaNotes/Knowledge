## Source[^2]
- $n$. Speech-like utterances with an impoverished range of syllabic and rhythmic patterns and no systematic grammatical structure, often believed by the speaker to be a real but unknown language, but on analysis quite unlike any natural language, commonly produced during Pentecostal Protestant and charismatic Roman Catholic religious services. Also called the gift of tongues or speaking in tongues. Glossolalia should be carefully distinguished from xenoglossia. glossolalic adj. \[From Greek glossa a tongue + lalein to babble]
