- The vegetation of the southern and south-western Cape region of South Africa, noted for its diversity of plants. Of more than 7,700 species found in the region, some $70 \%$ are endemic. These include many popular garden ornamentals, such as ericas, proteas, daisies, freesias, and gladioli. There are few trees or grasses, and vegetation is dominated by reeds, fine-leaved herbaceous species, and sclerophyllous shrubs with tough leathery leaves, all adapted to the poor soils and Mediterranean climate. Periodic wildfires prevent the growth of trees and help maintain the community by enabling the germination of new plants from seeds buried underground by native ants. The ants feed on special food bodies (elaiosomes) provided with the seeds (see MYRMECOCHORY). The spectacular variety of flowers also attracts numerous butterfly species, not to mention ecotourists. Many species unique to the fynbos are threatened with extinction.
