- an agent that prevents the development of new blood vessels (angiogenesis) by inhibiting the action of vascular endothelial growth factor (it is also known as anti-VEGF). Angiogenesis inhibitors are used as anticancer drugs, since growing cancers have a greater need for blood supply than normal tissue and must develop new blood vessels before progressing beyond a very small size. They include aflibercept, bevacizumab, and thalidomide. Because of their action, some of these drugs are used in the treatment of wet age-related macular degeneration.
