- A kill switch is an emergency safety mechanism that allows individuals and teams to shut down a piece of machinery when it cannot be shutdown in a typical manner. Industrial facilities often feature kill switches on dangerous machinery, so they can be quickly shut off if an accident occurs.
- Many company-issued mobile devices feature a remote kill switch that render the device useless or inaccessible when they are reported missing or stolen. This prevents sensitive company and customer information on such devices from being accessed by unauthorized users.
