- The last geological period in the Palaeozoic era. It extended from the end of the Carboniferous period, about 299 million years ago, to the beginning of the Mesozoic era, about 252 million years ago. It was named by the British geologist Roderick Murchison (1792-1871) in 1841 after the Perm province in Russia. In some areas continental conditions prevailed, which continued into the following period, the Triassic. These conditions resulted in the deposition of the New Red Sandstone. During the period a number of animal groups became extinct, including the trilobites, tabulate and rugose corals, and blastoids (see mass extinction). Amphibians and reptiles continued to be the dominant land animals and gymnosperms replaced ferns, clubmosses, and horsetails as the dominant plants.
