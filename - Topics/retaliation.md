## Synthesis

- A policy change made to punish another firm or country for its actions. In a trade war, for example, country $A$ retaliates to quotas on its exports to country $B$ by imposing quotas on $B$ 's goods. It is difficult in practice to distinguish between deliberate retaliation and policy changes which are simply a reaction to a worsening in country $A$ 's position. If a fall in exports to country $B$ worsens country $A$ 's balance of payments, $A$ may restrict imports for balance-of-payments reasons; while a fall in its exports injures country $B$, this is a side-effect rather than an objective of country $A$ 's policy.
