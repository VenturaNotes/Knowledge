- "terms that contain the same variable which is raised to the same power"

## Source[^2]
- Terms in an algebraic expression which are the same in relation to all variables and their powers and which are separated by addition or subtraction signs. Like terms can then be combined into a single term. So in $3x^2y + 6xy -5xy^2-2xy$ there are two like terms, the terms involving $xy$, but the other two terms are not 'like terms'. This expression could be simplified to $3x^2y+4xy-5xy^2$ but no further
