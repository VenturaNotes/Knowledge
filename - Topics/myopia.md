- Short-sightedness. It results from the lens of the eye refracting the parallel rays of light entering it to a focus in front of the retina generally because of an abnormally long eyeball. The condition is corrected by using diverging spectacle lenses to move the image back to the retina.
## Source[^2]
- (short-sightedness) $n$. the condition in which parallel light rays are brought to a focus in front of the retina (see illustration). Closer objects are clearer as compared to distant objects. Myopia is corrected by wearing spectacles with concave lenses; contact lenses and surgery can also be used to correct myopia (see EXCIMER LASER; LASEK; LASIK). Compare EMMETROPIA; HYPERMETROPIA. â€”myopic adj.
