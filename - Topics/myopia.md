- Short-sightedness. It results from the lens of the eye refracting the parallel rays of light entering it to a focus in front of the retina generally because of an abnormally long eyeball. The condition is corrected by using diverging spectacle lenses to move the image back to the retina.
## Source[^2]
- (short-sightedness) $n$. the condition in which parallel light rays are brought to a focus in front of the retina (see illustration). Closer objects are clearer as compared to distant objects. Myopia is corrected by wearing spectacles with concave lenses; contact lenses and surgery can also be used to correct myopia (see EXCIMER LASER; LASEK; LASIK). Compare EMMETROPIA; HYPERMETROPIA. â€”myopic adj.

	- Myopia (short-sightedness)
	- Parts
		- Uncorrected
			- Focusing point falls short of retina
		- Corrected
			- Concave lens diverges light rays falling on the eye
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Short-sightedness or difficulty in seeing distant objects clearly, caused by an excessively elongated eyeball in which light rays entering the eye are focused in front of the retina. Also called brachymetropia or near-sightedness. See also anomalous myopia. Compare emmetropia, hyperopia, PRESBYOPIA. myope or myops $n$. A short-sighted person. myopic adj. Short-sighted. \[From Greek myops short-sighted, from myein to close + ops an eye + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
