- A group of unsaturated hydrocarbons present in plants (see essential oil). Terpenes consist of isoprene units, $\mathrm{CH}_{2}\text{:} \mathrm{C}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right) \mathrm{CH}\text{:} \mathrm{CH}_{2}$. Monoterpenes have two units, $\mathrm{C}_{10} \mathrm{H}_{16}$, sesquiterpenes three units, $\mathrm{C}_{15} \mathrm{H}_{24}$, diterpenes four units, $\mathrm{C}_{20} \mathrm{H}_{32}$, etc. Derivatives of terpenes, known as terpenoids, include the plant hormones abscisic acid and gibberellin, and the carotenoid and chlorophyll pigments used in photosynthesis.
