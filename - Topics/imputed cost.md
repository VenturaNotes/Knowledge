- A cost that is not actually incurred by an organization but is introduced into the management accounting records in order to ensure that the costs incurred by dissimilar operations are comparable. For example, if rent is not payable by an operation it will be introduced as an imputed cost so that the costs may be compared with an operation that does pay rent.
