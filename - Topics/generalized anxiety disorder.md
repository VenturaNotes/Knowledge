- a condition characterized by inappropriate and sometimes severe anxiety, without adequate cause, that lasts for at least six months. It affects about $2 \%$ of the population, women twice as often as men, and often develops in early adult life. It can, however, start at any age. There is a hereditary tendency to develop the disorder and about $25 \%$ of immediate relatives of sufferers are also affected. The disorder is thought to be caused by a disturbance of the functions of neurotransmitters, such as adrenaline or GABA, in the frontal lobes or the limbic system of the brain. Symptoms affect all parts of the body. Palpitations, sweating, tremor, and dry mouth are core symptoms; additional symptoms include giddiness, bruxism, restlessness, fatigability, breathlessness, lightheadedness, headaches, pins and needles, chest pain, fear of imminent death or losing control, diarrhoea, flushing, dysphagia, cramps, and muscle ache. Treatment includes cognitive behavioural therapy and medication (SSRIs or SNRIs).
