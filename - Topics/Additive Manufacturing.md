- Additive manufacturing (AM), also called 3D printing, is a printing process that adds materials layer by layer to make a three-dimensional object from a digital design. AM uses computer-aided-design (CAD) software or 3D scanners to accurately deposit and layer the materials. In contrast, traditional methods remove materials through milling, machining, and other methods.
