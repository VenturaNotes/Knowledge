## Source [^1]
- $n$. A type of cell that is abundantly present in the adrenal medulla and that synthesizes adrenalin (epinephrine) from tyrosine in the presence of the cofactor vitamin C, stores it in vesicles, and secretes it into the bloodstream together with various other proteins and peptides in response to fear, anxiety, or stress. About 10 per cent of chromaffin cells synthesize and secrete the closely related substance noradrenalin (norepinephrine). \[From chromium + Latin affinis related to, alluding to the propensity of adrenalin to stain brown when exposed to chromium salts]
