A neurological test, designed to help in the diagnosis of loss of function and organic brain damage in children and adults, consisting of nine geometrical figures that are copied by the respondent, the drawings being evaluated according to the overall quality of the reproductions, their organization in relation to Gestalt grouping laws, and the errors made. It was constructed by the US neurologist Lauretta Bender (1897-1987) and first described by her in an article in the American Orthopsychiatric Association Research Monographs in 1938. It is sometimes used as a projective test. Also called the Bender Visual-Motor Gestalt Test or the Visual-Motor Gestalt Test. BGT abbrev.
