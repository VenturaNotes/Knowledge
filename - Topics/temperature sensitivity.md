- $\left(\boldsymbol{Q}^{\mathbf{1 0}}\right)$ A measure of how the rate of a reaction or metabolic process varies with temperature. It is given by the formula:$$Q_{10}=\frac{R_{T}}{R_{T-10}}$$where $R_{T}$ is the reaction rate at temperature $T$, and $R_{T-10}$ is the reaction rate at a temperature $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ lower. Values of $Q_{10}$ are typically between 2 and 3 for biological processes (a $Q_{10}$ of 2 means that the rate doubles for a temperature rise of $10^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ ).
