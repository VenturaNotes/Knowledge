- (synapsis) The close association between homologous chromosomes that develops during the first prophase of meiosis. The two chromosomes move together and a synaptonemal complex of proteins forms between them, ensuring exact pairing of corresponding points along their lengths as they lie side by side. The resulting structure is called a bivalent.
