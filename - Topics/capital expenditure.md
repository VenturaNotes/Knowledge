- Expenditure by a company which cannot be treated as a cost in calculating its profits. It thus has to be paid for either out of post-tax income, or by raising external finance. Capital expenditure may be on creating new capital goods, or, more often, on buying them from outside suppliers. It also includes the purchase of existing businesses, and of patents and trademarks.
