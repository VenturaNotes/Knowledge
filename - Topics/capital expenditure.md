- Expenditure by a company which cannot be treated as a cost in calculating its profits. It thus has to be paid for either out of post-tax income, or by raising external finance. Capital expenditure may be on creating new capital goods, or, more often, on buying them from outside suppliers. It also includes the purchase of existing businesses, and of patents and trademarks.
## Source[^2]
- (capital costs; capital investment; investment costs; investment expenditure) The expenditure by an organization of a significant amount for the purchase or improvement of a fixed asset; the amount expended would warrant the item being depreciated over an estimated useful life of a reasonably extended period. Capital expenditure is not charged against the profits of the organization when it takes place, but is regarded as an investment to be capitalized in the balance sheet as a fixed asset and subsequently charged against profits by depreciating the asset over its estimated useful life. Relief against taxation is available through capital allowances.
