### Example
- Given $3x^2$, take the derivative of the expression
	- $\frac{d}{dx}3x^2$ (taking the derivative)
	- $3\frac{d}{dx}x^2$ (factoring out the constant using the constant multiple rule)
	- $3*2x^{2-1}$ (Using the [[power rule]])
	- 6x (simplified)
## Source [^1]
- $\frac{d}{dx}[k*f(x)] = k*\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$
