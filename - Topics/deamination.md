## Source [^1]
- The removal of an amino group ($â€“NH_2$) from a compound. Enzymatic deamination occurs in the liver and is important in amino-acid metabolism, especially in their degradation and subsequent oxidation (see also OXIDATIVE DEAMINATION). The amino group is removed as ammonia and excreted, either unchanged or as urea or uric acid.
