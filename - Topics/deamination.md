## Source [^1]
- The removal of an amino group ($â€“NH_2$) from a compound. Enzymatic deamination occurs in the liver and is important in amino-acid metabolism, especially in their degradation and subsequent oxidation (see also OXIDATIVE DEAMINATION). The amino group is removed as ammonia and excreted, either unchanged or as urea or uric acid.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a process, occurring in the liver, that occurs during the metabolism of amino acids. The amino group $\left(-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)$ is removed from an amino acid and converted to ammonia, which is ultimately converted to urea and excreted.
