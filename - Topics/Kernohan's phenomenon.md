- (Kernohan's syndrome) hemiplegia that is ipsilateral to the brain lesion that caused it, due to pressure of the lesion (which is often a haematoma) on surrounding structures in the brain. It is unusual because normally a lesion of the brain causes dysfunction in the contralateral limbs. \[J. W. K. Kernohan (20th century), US pathologist]
