- $n$. A perceptual configuration or structure that possesses qualities transcending the sum of its constituent elements or parts and that cannot be described simply in terms of its parts. A classic example underlies melodic constancy: the sequence of notes C, D, E, C, C, D, E, C played evenly on any musical instrument is instantly recognizable as the well-known folk tune Frère Jacques; and the sequence F, G, A, F, F, G, A, F, which does not contain a single element in common with the first, sounds like exactly the same tune; but the sequence E, D, C, C, E, D, C, C, which contains the same elements as the first sequence in a new configuration, sounds like Three Blind Mice, an entirely different Gestalt. See also autochthonous, bundle hypothesis, Gestalt psychology, Gestaltqualität, grouping law, member, membership character, PrágNANZ, precision law, trait centrality. Gestalten $p l$. \[From German Gestalt shape or form, from Old High German stellen to shape]
