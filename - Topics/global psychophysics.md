- $n$. A term used by the US psychologist James Jerome Gibson (1904-79) to characterize his approach to the study of perception, in which an attempt is made to establish psychophysical correspondences between perceptions and behavior by examining relations between stimulus information and response, in contrast to classical psychophysics in which relations between stimulus intensity and response are examined. See also DIRECT PERCEPTION.
