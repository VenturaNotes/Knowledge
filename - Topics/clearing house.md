- A centralized and computerized system for settling indebtedness between members. The best known in the UK is Bacs (see UK Payments Administration), which enables the member banks to offset claims against one another for direct debits and credits. Similar arrangements exist in financial exchanges, in which sales and purchases are registered with the clearing house for settlement at the end of the accounting period. See also Clearstream; Euroclear; London Clearing House; Recognized Clearing House.
