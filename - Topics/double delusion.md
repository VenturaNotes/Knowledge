- the situation in which a patient (the inducer) presents with delusional symptoms that he or she believes to be shared by someone else who is incapable of expressing them (typically a child or a pet). This is different from a delusion by proxy, in which the inducer does not claim to be experiencing the symptoms himself or herself. The term was introduced in 2015 by Peter Lepping, Mark Rishniw, and Roland Wolfgang Freudenmann. Compare FOLIE Ã€ DEUX.
