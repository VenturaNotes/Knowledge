- $n$. diagnostic radiology: traditionally, the technique of examining the body by directing X-rays through it to produce images (radiographs) on photographic film or a fluoroscope. Increasingly radiography involves the production of images by computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine. It is used to produce images of disease in all parts of the body, to be interpreted by radiologists for physicians and surgeons. It is also widely used in dentistry for detecting dental caries, periodontal disease, periapical disease, the presence and position of unerupted teeth, and disease of the jaws. See also RADIOGRAPHER; RADIOLOGY.

- The process or technique of producing images of an opaque object, traditionally on photographic film or on a fluorescent screen, by means of radiation (either particles or electromagnetic waves of short wavelength, such as X-rays and gamma-rays). The data are now generally converted into images (radiographs) by a computer, using electronic detectors such as flat panel screens to produce digital data for analysis, viewing, and storage. Tomography employs numerous X-ray measurements processed by computer to build up a detailed picture of particular 'slices' of the body. Fluoroscopy is used to produce real-time moving images of internal organs, such as the heart; it is so named because traditionally it used a fluorescent screen to convert the X-rays into a visible image. See also AUTORADIOGRAPHY.
