- $n$. diagnostic radiology: traditionally, the technique of examining the body by directing X-rays through it to produce images (radiographs) on photographic film or a fluoroscope. Increasingly radiography involves the production of images by computerized tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and nuclear medicine. It is used to produce images of disease in all parts of the body, to be interpreted by radiologists for physicians and surgeons. It is also widely used in dentistry for detecting dental caries, periodontal disease, periapical disease, the presence and position of unerupted teeth, and disease of the jaws. See also RADIOGRAPHER; RADIOLOGY.
