- A business strategy in which decisions are made according to a preconceived plan and outcomes are realized as planned. In 1978 the business academic Henry Mintzberg contrasted such a strategy with an emergent strategy, in which some or all decisions occur in response to events. According to Mintzberg (who defines a strategy as a 'pattern in a stream of decisions'), a pure deliberate strategy must satisfy three conditions: that intentions are precise and detailed; that these intentions are known to all within an organization; and that they are realized exactly as they were formulated. In practice this is very rare, with most real-world strategies occurring somewhere along a continuum from purely deliberate to purely emergent. See also PRESCRIPTIVE STRATEGY.
