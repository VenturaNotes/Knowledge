- (ADLs) the tasks of everyday life. Basic ADLs include self-care tasks, such as bathing, dressing, eating, grooming, toileting, and moving. Instrumental ADLs include housework, shopping, managing finances, taking medication, and cooking. Inability to perform ADLs is a practical measure of disability in many disorders; problems are much more prevalent in the elderly.
