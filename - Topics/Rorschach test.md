- a test to measure aspects of personality, consisting of ten inkblots, half of which are in various colors and the other half in black and white. The responses to the different inkblots are used to derive hypotheses about the subject. The use of the test for the diagnosis of brain damage or schizophrenia is no longer generally supported. See also PROJECTIVE TEST. \[H. Rorschach (1884-1922), Swiss psychiatrist]
