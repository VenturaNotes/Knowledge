- An important probability distribution used instead of the normal distribution when the standard deviation is estimated from data. Discovered by W. S. Gosset ('Student') in 1908, the [[t distribution]] gives wider confidence intervals than the normal distribution because of the uncertainty in the estimate of the standard deviation (see MEASURES OF VARIATION). The probability values depend on an integer $f$, the number of degrees of freedom, which is the number associated with the estimate of the standard deviation. Tables of the $t$ distribution are widely available, but algorithms for direct computation are relatively lengthy.
- The most common applications are:
	- (a) testing differences between means of two samples;
	- (b) testing differences from zero of estimated parameters in regression analysis and experimental design;
	- (c) evaluation of confidence intervals for means and other estimated quantities.
