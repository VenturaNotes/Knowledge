- one of a group of drugs that includes the penicillins and the cephalosporins. All have a four-membered betalactam ring as part of their molecular structure. Beta-lactam antibiotics function by interfering with the growth of the cell walls of multiplying bacteria. Bacteria become resistant to these antibiotics by producing betalactamases, enzymes (such as penicillinase) that disrupt the beta-lactam ring. To counteract this, beta-lactamase inhibitors (e.g. clavulanic acid) may be added to beta-lactam antibiotics. For example, co-amoxiclav is a mixture of amoxicillin and clavulanic acid.
