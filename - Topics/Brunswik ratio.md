- n. An index of perceptual constancy given by $(R-S) /(A-S)$, where $R$ is the physical magnitude or intensity of the stimulus chosen as a match, $S$ is the physical magnitude or intensity for a stimulus match with zero constancy, and $A$ is the physical magnitude or intensity that would be chosen under 100 per cent constancy. The ratio is equal to zero when there is no perceptual constancy and 1 when there is perfect constancy. Because sensation increases as the logarithm of physical magnitude or intensity, according to Fechner's law, a modified version called the Thouless ratio was introduced in 1931. See also Brunswikian. \[Named after the Hungarian-born US psychologist Egon Brunswik (1903-55), who introduced it in 1929]
