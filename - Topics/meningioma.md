- $n$. a benign tumor arising from the fibrous coverings of the brain and spinal cord (meninges). It is usually slow-growing and produces symptoms by pressure on the underlying nervous tissue. In the brain the tumor may cause focal epilepsy and gradually progressive neurological disability. In the spinal cord it may cause paraplegia and the Brown-SÃ©quard syndrome. Rarely, meningiomas may behave in a malignant fashion and can invade neighboring tissues. Treatment of the majority of cases is by surgical removal if the tumor is accessible. The histological classification of malignancy is controversial, but some tumors may also require additional radiotherapy. Some patients have been known to have symptoms for as long as 30 years before the tumor has been discovered.
