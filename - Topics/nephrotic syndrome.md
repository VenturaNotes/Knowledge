- (NS) a condition defined by the triad of peripheral oedema, heavy proteinuria ( $>3.5 \mathrm{~g}/\text{day}$), and hypoalbuminaemia (serum albumin usually $>25 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ ). In most cases there is hypercholesterolaemia and lipiduria. There are many causes of the nephrotic syndrome. In children, the main cause is minimal change nephropathy, which is usually steroidresponsive. In adults, minimal change disease is still an important cause of NS, but is responsible for only a minority of cases. Many of the other causes of NS in adults are unlikely to respond to steroids and it is therefore usual practice to perform a biopsy before considering specific treatment. The commonest causes of NS in adults are diabetic nephropathy, focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, and membranous nephropathy. Preeclampsia is an important cause in late pregnancy.
