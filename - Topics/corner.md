- (a market) In a futures market, to create a situation where other people have between them contracted to deliver more of a good or security than is available. However high a price has to be agreed to obtain such contracts, the holder can make a large profit by forcing the counter-parties who cannot deliver to pay to be released from their contracts. In a commodities market, to buy and hoard a large amount of commodity sufficient for the price to be manipulated. Attempts to create a corner may fail if a high price brings in supplies from unexpected sources.

- The situation in which an individual or organization succeeds in establishing a controlling influence over the supply of a particular good or service. It will then force the price up until further supplies or substitutes can be found. This objective has often been attempted, but rarely achieved, in international commodity markets. Because it is undesirable and has antisocial effects, 'cornering the market' in this way is now generally prevented by government restrictions on monopolies and antitrust laws.
