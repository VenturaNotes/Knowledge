- abbrev. Electroencephalogram, a graphical representation of the gross electrical activity of the brain, recorded via electrodes attached to the scalp by an instrument called an electroencephalograph, first demonstrated in 1924 and examples published in 1929 by the German psychiatrist Hans Berger (1873-1941). EEGs manifest approximately periodic oscillating waves (see illustration) because of a form of feedback in which groups of excitatory neurons stimulate inhibitory neurons, which in turn stimulate excitatory neurons, creating negative-feedback circuits that cycle indefinitely. See also alpha blocking, alpha wave, beta wave, brain IMAGING, DEFAULT MODE NETWORK, DELTA WAVE, DESYNCHRONIZED EEG, GAMMA WAVE, MU WAVE, SENSORIMOTOR RHYTHM, THETA WAVE. Compare ELECTROCORTICOGRAM, ENCEPHALOGRAM. \[From Greek elektron amber (in which electricity was first observed) + en in + kephale the head + gramme a line]
