- the act of helping a patient to commit suicide by giving them the means (e.g. drugs) to do so. Aiding and abetting a suicide is a criminal offense in England and Wales by virtue of the Suicide Act 1961, section 2. Guidance on whether those who assist terminally ill patients in suicide - e.g. by accompanying people to jurisdictions where euthanasia is lawful, such as Switzerland - would be prosecuted for this offense, issued by the Director of Public Prosecutions in 2010, lists 6 'public interest factors' against and 16 in favor of prosecution. Those against include that the person assisted had reached a voluntary, clear, settled and informed decision to commit suicide and that the person assisting them was wholly motivated by compassion. Those factors in favor of prosecution include that the person assisting was acting in his or her capacity as a medical doctor, nurse, or other caring or custodial professional. For doctors to respect the decision of a patient with capacity to refuse life-saving or lifepreserving treatment, however, is not legally regarded as assisted suicide. See also EUTHANASIA.
