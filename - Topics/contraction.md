## Source[^2]
- (in animal physiology) The shortening of muscle fibres in order to exert a force on a tissue or organ of the body. In striated muscle contraction is brought about by interaction of actin and myosin filaments (see SARCOMERE; SKELETAL MUSCLE; SLIDING FILAMENT THEORY): it provides a force for locomotion and plays a role in maintaining the balance and posture of the animal. See also SMOOTH MUSCLE.
