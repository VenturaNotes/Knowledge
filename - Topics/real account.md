- A ledger account for some types of property (e.g. land and buildings, plant, investments, stock) as distinct from a nominal account, which would be for revenue or expense items (e.g. sales, motor expenses, discount received, etc.). This distinction is now largely obsolete and both sets of accounts are maintained in the same ledger, usually referred to as the nominal ledger.
