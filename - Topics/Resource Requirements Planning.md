- Resource requirements planning (RRP) converts an organization's production plan or master production schedule into the impact of key resources such as labor, storage, shipping dollars and inventory levels. It allows companies to optimize the resources they need to execute day-to-day tasks based on their existing plans and schedules. RRP calculates the requirements for each resource based on planned production so managers can improve planning, capacity and financials.
