- a dangerous situation in which there is a build-up of fluid around the heart within the pericardial sac. This causes compression of the heart, which is therefore unable to fill with blood adequately in order to pump effectively. Cardiac tamponade can result in heart failure, a drop in blood pressure, or cardiac arrest. It requires treatment by drainage of the fluid. The classical diagnostic features, known as Beck's triad, consist of dilated neck veins, a fall in blood pressure, and muffled heart sounds.
