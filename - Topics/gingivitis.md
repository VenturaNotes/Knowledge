- $n$. a reversible inflammation of the gums (see GINGIVA) caused by plaque on the surfaces of the teeth at their necks. The gums are swollen and bleed easily. Chronic gingivitis can be an early precursor to periodontal disease but is reversible with good oral hygiene. Ulcerative gingivitis is painful and destructive. Gingival overgrowth may be caused by drug therapy, e.g. phenytoin, or hormones during pregnancy.
