- Enterprise architecture defines the policies and processes an organization uses to minimize business disruption. That means making changes in an organization to reduce the risk of downtime, network disruption, adverse weather, loss of talent, and other negative events. Companies make these changes to achieve their business vision. For example, enterprises might create guidelines for responding to a cyberattack. If a cyberattack happens, these enterprises can reduce any disruptions, such as data loss, and protect their business. Enterprise architecture mitigates the risks associated with negative events, such as high financial costs and reputation loss.
