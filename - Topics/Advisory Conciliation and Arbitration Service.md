- (ACAS) A UK government body set up in 1975 to mediate in industrial disputes in both the public and private sectors. Its findings are not binding on either side, but carry considerable weight. In some cases, especially those involving a dispute over the recognition of a trade union, it will refer a matter to the Central Arbitration Committee. Its members include employers and trade unionists as well as academics and other independent persons. Since 1998 ACAS has also appointed arbitrators to give binding decisions in cases of alleged unfair dismissal. Under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013, anyone intending to bring a claim to an employment tribunal must first approach ACAS, with a view to achieving a pre-hearing settlement.
