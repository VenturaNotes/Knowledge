- Wi-Fi calling is a service that allows mobile device users to place and receive calls over a wireless connection, rather than using a cellular signal. Wi-Fi calling is powered by Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). When Wi-Fi calling is enabled on a device, the user’s phone will identify the strongest network available and route the call through the Wi-Fi network. However, if a cellular signal is available and stronger than the Wi-Fi networkʻs connection, the phone will route the incoming or outgoing call through the user’s cellular network. Users can make Wi-Fi calls directly from their mobile device using their device’s built-in dial pad or messaging application. Wi-Fi calling allows mobile device users to make free calls when connected to a reliable Wi-Fi network and is one of the best alternatives for users that reside in areas with poor cellular coverage.
