- $n$. an infectious bacterial disease that usually takes the form of painful abscesses in the jaw. It is caused by the genus Actinomyces, with Actinomyces israelii and Actinomyces gerencseriae being responsible for the majority of infections. The bacterium is normally present in the mouth but it may become pathogenic following a dental infection, radiation therapy, or trauma causing local tissue damage (including a dental extraction). It can also affect the lungs, breast, or gastrointestinal tract. Treatment is by surgical drainage of pus and a prolonged course of antibiotics. Hyperbaric oxygenation may also be used.
