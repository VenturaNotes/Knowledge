- $n$. The process of attempting to produce radical changes in a person's attitudes or beliefs through the application of techniques such as sensory deprivation, sleep deprivation, induced hunger, pain, extreme physical discomfort, and the alternation of interrogations by kind and cruel inquisitors. The word was first used in print by the US journalist and (as it transpired) CIA agent Edward Hunter (1902-78) in an article in the Miami News entitled '"Brain-Washing" Tactics Force Chinese into Ranks of Communist Party' on 24 September 1950 and widely adopted after the publication in 1951 of Hunter's book, Brain-washing in Red China: The Calculated Destruction of Men's Minds. \[From Mandarin Chinese xĭ-năo brain-washing, from xĭ to wash or bathe + năo brain]
