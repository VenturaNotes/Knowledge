- the use of enteral feeding tubes or cannulas to administer nutrients and fluids directly into the gastrointestinal tract or bloodstream when the oral route cannot be used owing to disability or disease. When other intensive treatments are judged futile, artificial nutrition and hydration are considered extraordinary means of prolonging life in patients who have no prospect of recovery. It is permissible to withdraw such treatment when it is no longer in the patient's interests and when the primary intention is not to kill the patient, although death is foreseen (see DOCTRINE OF DOUBLE EFFECT). In cases of patients in a persistent vegetative state in England and Wales, the matter must be referred to the courts following the case of Tony Bland. Where food and water are withdrawn it is still considered important to moisten the patient's lips and to keep him or her comfortable until death.
