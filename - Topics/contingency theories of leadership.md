- In industrial and organizational psychology, various models stating that the performance of a leader will depend not only on his or her qualities or methods but also on certain key aspects of the work situation. The leader will be most effective when his or her leadership style is best suited to the characteristics of the group (e.g. level of experience) and the nature of the group task (e.g. whether clearly structured or not). One of the earliest and most influential of such theories, that of Fred Fiedler, proposes that task-motivated leaders will be most successful in very favourable or very unfavourable situations and that relationship-motivated leaders will be most successful when the situation is not so extreme. Some other models suggest that it may be easier for the leader to alter the work situation to suit his or her style than vice versa. See LEADERSHIP THEORIES.
