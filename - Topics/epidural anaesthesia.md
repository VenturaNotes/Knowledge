- suppression of sensation in the lower part of the body by the injection of a local anaesthetic into the epidural space. The injection site is often the sacral or lumbar regions of the vertebral column, and a special blunt needle with a side-hole is used to reduce the chance of penetrating the dura. A fine catheter is passed through the needle to enable repeated or continuous infusion of anaesthetic solution. Epidural anaesthesia is particularly useful for providing pain relief during childbirth, to reduce the need for deep general anaesthesia, and for postoperative analgesia.
