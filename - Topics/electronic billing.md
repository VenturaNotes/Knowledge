- (e-billing) The facility to send invoices and accept payments for goods and services over the Internet. The payment and presentment services can be divided into two types: biller-direct payments, in which the supplier sends the consumer a statement of account by electronic means and receives payment in the same way; and bankaggregator payments, in which online banking enables a bank-account holder to pay bills to a variety of other users.
