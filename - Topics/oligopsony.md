- A market in which there are numerous potential sellers but a small number of buyers. Under oligopsony, buyers are in a strong position to dictate terms and can pass many costs and risks on to the supplier. Markets in soft commodities are often oligopsonistic, especially where large Western companies buy from numerous small producers in the developing world.

- A market with a small number of buyers in which the choice of one buyer affects the pay-offs of the others. This is the equivalent on the demand side of oligopoly on the supply side of a market.
