- (HNPCC, Lynch syndrome) an inherited disorder in which there is an increased incidence of colorectal polyp formation, although to a lesser extent than in familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). HNPCC has also been associated with other types of tumour, particularly ovarian and endometrial tumours. This increased risk is due to inherited mutations that impair DNA mismatch repair.
