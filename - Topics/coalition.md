- A group of individuals or firms who have separate objectives, but combine to adopt strategies or advocate policies. A coalition government is one relying on the support of two or more political parties. A coalition may be unstable and eventually dissolve or collapse with the emergence of new situations or policy issues that have different impacts on its members, whenever the members of the coalition are interested in exploring the possibility that an alternative alliance might enable them to achieve more of their own objectives.
