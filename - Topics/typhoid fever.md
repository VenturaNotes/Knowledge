- an infection of the digestive system by the bacterium Salmonella typhi, causing general weakness, headache, high fever, a rash (rose spots) on the chest and abdomen, chills, and sweating. In serious cases inflammation of the spleen and bones, delirium, and intestinal haemorrhage may occur. It is transmitted through food or drinking water contaminated by the faeces or urine of patients or carriers. Often recovery occurs naturally but relapses are common. Treatment is usually with antibiotics, such as ciprofloxacin or ceftriaxone. Vaccines that provide temporary immunity are available. Compare PARATYPHOID FEVER.
