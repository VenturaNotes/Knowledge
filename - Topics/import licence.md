- A permit allowing an importer to bring a stated quantity of certain goods into a country.

They also function as a means of exchange control, the licence both permitting importation and allowing the importer to purchase the required foreign currency.

- A permit from the government to import particular goods. The requirement for import licences may be intended to protect domestic producers from competition, to improve the balance of trade by restricting imports, or to facilitate government control over dangerous materials such as explosives.
