- A lifetime gift that is not covered by any of the exemptions and is therefore liable to inheritance tax. A potentially exempt transfer becomes a chargeable transfer where the death of the donor occurs within seven years of the transfer being made. A chargeable lifetime transfer is one that is neither an exempt transfer nor potentially exempt; in practice, this applies only to payment into a discretionary trust. Such a transfer is liable to inheritance tax at the lifetime rate of $20 \%$, payable at the time of the transfer.
