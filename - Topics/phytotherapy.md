- $n$. medical treatment based exclusively on plant extracts and products. Plants have provided a wide range of important drugs (taxanes among others) and current research into drugs from plants continues to be fruitful. However, it is essential that any drugs derived directly from plants should be extracted, purified, assayed, and tested before being used as medication. The use of crude plant extracts as medicines can be dangerous because seemingly identical samples of the same plant may contain widely differing amounts of the active ingredient.
