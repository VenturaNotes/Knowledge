## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An amino acid that also functions as a neurotransmitter
## Source[^2]
- The anion of the amino acid glutamic acid. It functions as a neurotransmitter at excitatory synapses in the vertebrate central nervous system and at excitatory neuromuscular junctions in insects and crustaceans. In plants, glutamate is the initial acceptor molecule in the assimilation of the ammonium ion $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{4}{ }^{+}\right)$, combining with it to form glutamine in a reaction involving ATP. See also GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A salt of glutamic acid, the main excitatory neurotransmitter for all nerve impulses in the diencephalon and telencephalon and for sensory impulses in the peripheral nervous system. See also KAINIC ACID, lithium. \[From glutamic acid + -ate indicating a salt or ester of an acid]
