- $n$. A diagram representing an interaction effect in multifactorial analysis of variance (ANOVA). For the simplest two-way interaction, the vertical axis represents scores on the dependent variable, the horizontal axis different levels of one independent variable, and each line on the graph a different level of another independent variable. If the lines are parallel, there is no interaction effect; if the lines cross or are non-parallel, then there is an interaction effect that can be tested for statistical significance.
