- $n$. an ablation technique in which extreme cold is used to destroy tumor or abnormal tissue. Nitrogen or argon gas is passed through the ablation probe to freeze the tissue around it. The technique is mostly used to destroy abnormal conducting tissue in the heart, especially abnormal cells around the pulmonary veins as they enter the left atrium in patients with atrial fibrillation. However, it is also used for kidney, prostate, and bone tumours. Radiofrequency ablation is an alternative approach.
