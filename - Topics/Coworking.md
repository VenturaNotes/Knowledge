- The term coworking is used to describe an arrangement in which a single office space is shared by business professionals in order to save costs on equipment, utilities, custodial services, and workspace rentals. Private coworking spaces are often rented out by companies to provide a working space for large teams within their organization. On the other hand, open workspaces often feature business professionals from various companies that occupy the open office space for a set fee. Coworking spaces are popular among contract workers and corporate employees that work remotely, as they allow them to work in an environment with other business professionals and avoid the feeling of social isolation. Coworking spaces typically feature office machinery such as printers, copiers, and fax machines, in addition to shared bathrooms, kitchen spaces, and lounges.
