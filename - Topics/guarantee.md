- (2) A promise made by a third party (guarantor), who is not a party to a contract between two others, to accept liability if one of the parties fails to fulfil the contractual obligations. For example, a bank may make a loan to a person, provided that a guarantor is prepared to repay the loan if the borrower fails to do so. The banker may require the guarantor to provide some security to support his guarantee. See also BANK GUARANTEE.
