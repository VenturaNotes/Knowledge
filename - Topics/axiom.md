- A statement whose truth is either to be taken as self-evident or to be assumed. Many areas of pure mathematics, such as group theory, involve assuming a set of axioms and discovering what results can be logically deduced from them. See ABSTRACTION
## Source[^2]
- A sentence or proposition that is not proved or demonstrated but is used as a starting point for deducing other conclusions. When used in economics, an axiom is any initial assumption from which other statements are logically derived. In this use, an axiom is not necessarily a self-evident truth but is instead a formal statement used in further deduction.
## Source[^3]
- In logic, a statement that is stipulated to be true for a particular chain of reasoning. See DEDUCTION.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. A statement or proposition that can be accepted without proof or evidence and that may therefore occur as a premise but not the conclusion of an argument. In formal proofs in logic and mathematics, axioms are stipulated as true for the purposes of the chain of argument that follows. Also called a postulate. axiomatic adj. \[From Greek axioma a self-evident truth, from axioein to consider worthy, from axios worthy]
