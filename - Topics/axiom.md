- A statement whose truth is either to be taken as self-evident or to be assumed. Many areas of pure mathematics, such as group theory, involve assuming a set of axioms and discovering what results can be logically deduced from them. See ABSTRACTION

## Source[^2]
- A sentence or proposition that is not proved or demonstrated but is used as a starting point for deducing other conclusions. When used in economics, an axiom is any initial assumption from which other statements are logically derived. In this use, an axiom is not necessarily a self-evident truth but is instead a formal statement used in further deduction.
