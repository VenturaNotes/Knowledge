- $n$. Any internal source of motivation that impels an organism to pursue a goal or to satisfy a need, such as sex, hunger, or self-preservation. A primary drive is an innate physiological urge or need, such as hunger, thirst, or the need for sex; a secondary drive is an acquired non-physiological urge, such as the need for achievement or the need for affiliation. More generally, a person's energy and determination to achieve something (We're looking for a salesman with a lot of drive). In psychoanalysis, another name for instinct (3). See also NEED (2).
