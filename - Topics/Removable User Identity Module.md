- A Removable User Identity Module (R-UIM) is a specific type of data card. R-UIMs were invented for the express purpose of taking GSM SIM cards and extending them to a CDMA network. This made phones compatible on both GSM and CDMA networks, something that was previously not possible. R-UIMs were supplanted by later technological innovations, though they are still in limited use today.
