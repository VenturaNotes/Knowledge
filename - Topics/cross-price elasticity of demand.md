- The ratio between the proportional change in demand for a good and the proportional change in the price of a different good. This is calculated assuming that the price of the good itself is constant. Thus if $q_{x}$ is the quantity of good $x$, and $p_{y}$ is the price of good $y$, the cross-price elasticity of demand is given by$$\varepsilon_{x y}=\frac{\partial q_{x}}{q_{x}} / \frac{\partial p_{y}}{p_{y}}=\frac{p_{y}}{q_{x}} \frac{\partial q_{x}}{\partial p_{y}}$$If $\varepsilon_{x y}>0, x$ and $y$ are substitutes; if $\varepsilon_{x y}<0, x$ and $y$ are complements.
