- A technique of time division multiplexing of a number of subchannels onto a common wider-bandwidth channel, where the total bandwidth required by the individual subchannels exceeds the bandwidth of the multiplex channel. Since the maximum rate required by any one channel is seldom used, due to breaks in transmission, this technique is possible through judicious use of buffering. In this system bandwidth is not allocated permanently to each subchannel but only as required.
## Source[^2]
- Statistical multiplexing is a technique that is used for the allotment of channel slots in network transmission. Transmission channels are allotted automatically, based on need. If there are available channels, data can be transmitted over multiple channels. This has the effect of speeding up the rate of transmission. If channels are more limited, the information is transmitted based on how much data is needed for each channel. It can also be used when transmitting multiple types of data over the same network. This occurs when data is divided and sent over the total allotment of available channels.
