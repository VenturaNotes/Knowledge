## Synthesis

- A technique of time division multiplexing of a number of subchannels onto a common wider-bandwidth channel, where the total bandwidth required by the individual subchannels exceeds the bandwidth of the multiplex channel. Since the maximum rate required by any one channel is seldom used, due to breaks in transmission, this technique is possible through judicious use of buffering. In this system bandwidth is not allocated permanently to each subchannel but only as required.
