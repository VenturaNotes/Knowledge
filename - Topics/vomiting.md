- $n$. the reflex action of expelling the contents of the stomach through the mouth. Vomiting is controlled by a special centre in the brain that may be stimulated by certain drugs or by nerve signalling from the stomach (e.g. after ingesting toxic substances or in stomach diseases, such as peptic ulceration or pyloric stenosis), the intestine (e.g. in intestinal obstruction), or from the inner ear (in motion sickness). The stimulated vomiting center sets off a chain of nerve impulses producing coordinated contractions of the diaphragm and abdominal muscles and relaxation of the sphincter between the gullet and the stomach, leading to the forcible ejection of stomach contents. Medical name: emesis.
