- an X-ray technique for examination of the coronary arteries, often taken to also include examination of the chambers of the heart. A catheter is introduced via the radial artery at the wrist or the femoral artery at the groin and manipulated into the heart under X-ray control. Contrast medium is then injected to outline the ventricles and coronary arteries. Digital video images are recorded during contrast-medium injection. Coronary angiography is used to diagnose cardiac disease, specifically narrowing or blockage in the coronary arteries, and plan treatment by surgery or radiological interventional techniques (see CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT; PERCUTANEOUS CORONARY INTERVENTION). It has now largely been replaced by CT coronary angiography.
