- Abstract algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies algebraic structures, which are sets equipped with operations that satisfy specific rules and properties
	- #question Are all algebraic structures sets in abstract algebra?
- The structures formalize and generalize mathematical concepts like numbers, operations, and [[symmetry]]
	- #question Is there a different meaning of symmetry in abstract algebra?
	- Main focus is understanding the properties of these structures and how they relate to one another
### Core Topics
- [[set|Sets]] and their operations
