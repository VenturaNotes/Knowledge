## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Abstract algebra is the branch of mathematics that studies algebraic structures, which are sets equipped with operations that satisfy specific rules and properties
	- #question Are all algebraic structures sets in abstract algebra?
- The structures formalize and generalize mathematical concepts like numbers, operations, and [[symmetry]]
	- #question Is there a different meaning of symmetry in abstract algebra?
	- Main focus is understanding the properties of these structures and how they relate to one another
### Core Topics
- [[set|Sets]] and their operations

## Source[^2]
- The area of mathematics concerned with algebraic structures, such as groups, rings, and fields, involving sets of elements with particular operations satisfying certain axioms. The theory of certain algebraic structures is highly developed; in particular, the theory of vector spaces is so extensive that its study, known as linear algebra, and is essentially a separate subject from abstract algebra.
