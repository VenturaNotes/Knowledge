- $n$. The second Kohlberg stage of moral development, in which right and wrong are defined in terms of convention and 'what people would say'. It is divided into two levels: at Level 3 the child's moral behavior is guided by the goal of gaining approval and avoiding disapproval of others (I should not tell lies because then people will respect me), and at Level 2 by rigid codes of 'law and order' (I should not tell lies because it is forbidden). Compare postconventional morality, PRECONVENTIONAL MORALITY.
