- a malignant tumor of bone occurring in children and young adults. Distinguished from osteosarcoma by J. Ewing in 1921, it commonly arises in the femur but is liable to spread to other bones and to the lung. It usually presents with pain, often associated with fever and leucocytosis. The tumor is sensitive to radiotherapy, and systemic therapy with cytotoxic drugs has greatly improved its prognosis. \[J. Ewing (1866-1943), US pathologist]
