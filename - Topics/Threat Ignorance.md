- Threat ignorance is a cybersecurity concept that cybersecurity professionals often use to determine how susceptible a company is to a system cyberattack. High levels of threat ignorance on a companyâ€™s behalf often result in data breaches, credential theft, denial-of-service attacks, phishing schemes, and other forms of cyberattacks. Businesses can better address their threat ignorance by simply learning what cyberthreats their business computer systems may encounter and putting the necessary cybersecurity protections in place.
