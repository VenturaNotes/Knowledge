- (nearthrosis) n. a 'false' joint. Congenital pseudarthrosis occurs in childhood, when an apparent fracture in the tibia or clavicle is followed by non-union. A pseudarthrosis can form in adulthood when a fracture fails to unite and the bone ends are separated by fibrous tissue, which allows some movement across the fracture site.
