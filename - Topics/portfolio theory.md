- A theoretical approach to investment choices based on the assumption that for any given expected return, rational investors will seek to minimize their risk and that for any given level of risk they will seek to maximize their return. On this basis a set of efficient portfolios can be calculated from which the investor will choose the one most appropriate for their risk profile. The practical conclusions of the theory are that investors should diversify widely and hold a mixture of long and short positions to minimize systematic risk. Portfolio theory was influential in the 1960s and 1970s but many of its assumptions have since been questioned by behavioral finance. See also MARKOWITZ MODEL; PORTFOLIO INSURANCE.

- The analysis of how individual assets should be selected for a portfolio to achieve the most preferred combination of risk and return. Portfolio theory studies how the returns and risks of individual assets interact when combined into a portfolio. The fundamental results of the theory are the characterization of the portfolio frontier (the set of portfolios that maximize return for a given level of risk) and the identification of the minimum variance portfolio (the portfolio with the least variance). Any risk-averse investor will select a portfolio from the efficient frontier according to their degree of risk aversion. The higher the degree of risk aversion, the closer will be the chosen portfolio to the minimum variance portfolio. See also MEAN-VARIANCE PREFERENCES.
