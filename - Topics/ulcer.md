- (1) a break in an epithelial surface. See also DENDRITIC ULCER. 
- (2) a break in the skin extending to all its layers, or a break in the mucous membrane lining the alimentary tract, that fails to heal and is often accompanied by inflammation. Of the many types of skin ulcer, the most common is the venous (or hypostatic) ulcer of the leg, known incorrectly as a varicose ulcer, which is caused by increased venous pressure and usually occurs in older women. See also ARTERIAL ULCER; PRESSURE SORE.
- For ulcers of the alimentary tract, see APHTHOUS ULCER; DUODENAL ULCER; GASTRIC ULCER; PEPTIC ULCER; STRESS ULCERS.
