- a group of insulins in which the insulin molecules are combined with protamine molecules to slow down their rate of absorption from the injection site. The insulin is released steadily from the skin into the bloodstream to stabilize blood sugar over a longer period. Mixtures of isophane and fast-acting insulins are also available (biphasic insulin aspart, biphasic insulin lispro, biphasic isophane insulin).
