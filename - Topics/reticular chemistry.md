## Source [^1]
- The branch of chemistry concerned with constructing molecular frameworks with strong bonds between atoms from smaller molecular units. Reticular chemistry has led to the synthesis of covalent organic frameworks, metal-organic frameworks, and new types of zeolites. The field has been developed extensively in the 21st century and has many possible applications in environmental chemistry.
