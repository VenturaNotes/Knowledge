- The paradox in logic where an ass is exactly halfway between two buckets of water and dies of thirst because it has no logical basis on which to decide to move to either one.

- $n$. A problem of decision making typified by a hungry ass standing between two equidistant and equally attractive bales of hay who starves to death because reason provides no grounds for choosing one rather than the other. See also APPROACH-APPROACH CONFLICT. \[Named after the French scholastic philosopher Jean Buridan (?1295-1358) to whom the example is attributed]
