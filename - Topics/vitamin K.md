## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- a fat-soluble vitamin occurring in two main forms: phytomenadione (of plant origin) and menaquinone (synthesized by bacteria in the large intestine; deficiency is rare). It is necessary for the formation of prothrombin in the liver, which is essential for blood clotting, and it also regulates the synthesis of other clotting factors. Good dietary sources are green leafy vegetables and meat. Large changes in the dietary intake of vitamin K should be avoided by people taking warfarin.
## Source[^2]
- Any of several related fat-soluble compounds, including vitamins $\mathbf{K}_{1}$ (phylloquinone) and $\mathbf{K}_{2}$ (menaquinone), that act as coenzymes in the gamma-carboxylation of glutamate amino acid residues in certain proteins. Such a reaction is essential for the function of various proteins involved in blood coagulation (e.g. prothrombin and certain other coagulation factors) and bone metabolism. Deficiency of vitamin K, which leads to extensive bleeding, is rare because a form of the vitamin is manufactured by intestinal bacteria. Green vegetables and egg yolk are good sources.
