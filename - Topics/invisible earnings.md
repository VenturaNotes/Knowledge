- (invisibles) The earnings from abroad that contribute to the balance of payments as a result of transactions involving services, such as insurance, banking, shipping, and tourism (often known as invisibles), rather than the sale and purchase of goods. Invisibles can play an important part in a nation's current account, although they are often difficult to quantify. The UK relies on a substantial invisible balance in its balance of payments.
