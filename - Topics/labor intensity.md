- The proportion of labor in the total inputs to a productive process. A process is called labor-intensive if the ratio of labor to other inputs is large relative to other production processes. When a production process permits substitution between inputs, labor intensity can be varied in response to changes in the relation between real wages and the cost of using other inputs.
