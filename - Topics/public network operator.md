- An organization authorized to offer network services to other organizations, or directly to members of the public. In those countries with a government monopoly in the provision of network services the only PNO will be the PTT. In those countries with a deregulated market in the provision of network services, it is still only appropriately licensed organizations that are allowed to act as PNOs.
