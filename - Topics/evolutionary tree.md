- (phylogenetic tree) A diagram depicting the evolutionary relationships between species or groups of organisms as (usually) dichotomously branching lines to form a treelike pattern. In some trees, changes in the relative abundance of a lineage are indicated by the width of the branch. A phylogram is a special type of evolutionary tree constructed so that the branch lengths reflect the evolutionary distance separating ancestors and descendants. See also CLADISTICS.
