## Source [^1]
- The structural and functional arrangement of the parts of an organism. The 'blueprint' according to which an organism develops a predetermined number, arrangement, and size of body components is embodied and implemented by the organism's genes (e.g. homeotic genes), but can be influenced by environmental factors, such as malnutrition or exposure to toxic agents (e.g. teratogens). See also bilateral SYMMETRY; radial SYMMETRY.
