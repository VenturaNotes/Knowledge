- An economic variable that has a time dimension. For flow variables an indication of the unit of time over which they are measured is essential: for example, output per hour worked, or pay per week. Income, expenditure, and exports are other examples of flow variables. These are contrasted with stock variables, which are defined as quantities existing at a moment of time. Capital, the labour force, and debt are stocks.
