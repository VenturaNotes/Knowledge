- (1) The unit of information transferred by a message switching system. Messages may be of any length, from a few bits to a complete file, and no part of a message is released to its final recipient until all of the message has been received at the network node adjacent to the destination. 
- (2) Another name (deprecated) for packet. The distinction between packet and message is valuable, since it refers to whether or not a partial transmission of a complete document can occur; a packet switching system may allow this whereas a message switching system may not. 
- (3) See Shannon's MODEL (of a communication system). 
- (4) A specially formatted document sent in an email system. 
- (5) See OBJECT, OBJECT-ORIENTED PROGRAMMING.
