- (1) The maximin principle is a theory of distributive justice proposed by John Rawls (1921-2002). The principle states that the social objective should be the maximization of the utility of the worst-off person (the person with the minimum utility). This objective is represented by the maximin, or Rawlsian, social welfare function $W=\min \left\{U^{h}\right\}$.
- (2) In decision theory and game theory, maximin is the objective of maximizing the minimum gain. The maximin strategy represents a conservative play of a game and need not be a Nash equilibrium strategy. The terminology first arose in two-player zero-sum games. In such a game the gain for one player is the loss of another. Hence, the game can be represented by a pay-off matrix that displays only the pay-offs to player 1. Player 1 will choose a strategy to maximize the pay-off while player 2 will choose a strategy to minimize it. The resulting equilibrium is termed maximin.

- $n$. In decision theory and game theory, an alternative or strategy (2) that ensures the best of the worst possible payoffs, thereby maximizing the minimum possible payoff. Thus if there are three available alternatives, and if the worst that can happen is a small loss if the first alternative is chosen, a medium loss if the second alternative is chosen, and a large loss if the third alternative is chosen, then the first alternative is the maximin alternative irrespective of what other payoffs are possible.
