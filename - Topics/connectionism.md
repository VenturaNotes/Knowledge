- A branch of artificial intelligence that advocates the use of massively parallel systems based on many simple processing elements with large numbers of connections between them. Inspiration is derived from brain models, with neural networks providing the classic example of connectionism.
- The connectionist approach to machine learning is based on the idea that all learning may be achieved through the local or global adjustment of weights that express the strength of connections between elements in the network.

- n. 
- (1) An approach to artificial intelligence involving the design of intelligent systems composed of neural networks in which items of knowledge are represented not by single locations or units but by patterns of activation over collections of units, these patterns being adaptive inasmuch as they are capable of learning from experience. It was first introduced in 1948 in an article on 'Intelligent Machinery' by the English mathematician Alan Mathison Turing (1912-54) but became popular only after the publication in 1981 of a connectionist model of human memory developed by the US cognitive scientist James L(loyd) McClelland (born 1948). Turing's article was partly anticipated by an article in 1943 by the US neurophysiologist Warren S(turgis) McCulloch (1898-1968) and the self-taught US logician Walter Pitts (1923-69), but that early version crucially lacked the ability to learn. Also called parallel distributed processing . See also back-propagation algorithm, CASCADE processing, delta rule, distributed network model, gradient descent, Hebbian rule, hill climbing, knowledge representation, teacher unit. Compare Distributed Cognition. 
- (2) A term used by the US psychologist Edward Lee Thorndike (1874-1949) to refer to his interpretation of trial-and-error learning as the formation of associations between situations (not ideas) and responses. See also law of effect. Compare associationism. 
- connectionist n. 
	- (1) One who practises or advocates connectionism (1, 2). adj. 
	- (2) Of or relating to connectionism $(1,2)$.
