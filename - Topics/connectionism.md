- A branch of artificial intelligence that advocates the use of massively parallel systems based on many simple processing elements with large numbers of connections between them. Inspiration is derived from brain models, with neural networks providing the classic example of connectionism.
- The connectionist approach to machine learning is based on the idea that all learning may be achieved through the local or global adjustment of weights that express the strength of connections between elements in the network.
