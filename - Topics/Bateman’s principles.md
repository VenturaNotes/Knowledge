- $n$. A set of three principles put forward by the English geneticist Angus J(ohn) Bateman (1919-96) in an article in the journal Heredity in 1948 that, if correct, lead to the conclusion that natural selection should always favor 'an undiscriminating eagerness in the males and a discriminating passivity in the females' to obtain mates. The principles are:
	- (1) Males show greater variance in number of offspring than females;
	- (2) Males show greater variance in number of sexual partners than females; and
	- (3) There is a stronger relationship between reproductive success and mating success among males than females.
- The fundamental ideas are that females generally invest more energy in producing offspring than males do, and that females are a resource over which males compete; this leads to competition among males, and the resulting sexual selection generates greater variability in reproductive success among males than females. Although Bateman's own research with fruit flies was flawed, biologists generally accept his principles and the implication that males tend to be promiscuous and undiscriminating, whereas females tend to be coy and choosy, although there are exceptions in some species, and the relevance to humans is controversial.
