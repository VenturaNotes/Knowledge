- System integration combines hardware, software, networking resources, and IT infrastructure into one system. It ensures all these technologies work together as part of a single framework. There are two main types of system integration:
	- Horizontal system integration creates a new system that serves a single interface for all other systems.
	- Vertical system integration combines subsystems based on their functionality.
