- A technique that takes into account the reduction in time taken to carry out production as the cumulative output rises. The concept is based on a doubling of output, so that a $70 \%$ learning curve means that the cumulative average time taken per unit falls to $70 \%$ of the previous cumulative average time as the output doubles. The cumulative average time per unit is measured from the very first unit produced. The formula for the learning curve is: $$y=a x^{-b}$$where $y$ is the cumulative average time per unit of production, $a$ is the time taken to produce the first unit, $x$ is the cumulative number of units manufactured to date, and $b$ is the learning coefficient.

- A relationship between the duration of learning and the amount of accumulated knowledge or skills, or between experience and efficiency. The learning curve effect states that as a task is performed more and more often the cost of doing this task falls.
