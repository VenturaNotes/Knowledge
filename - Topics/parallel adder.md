- A binary adder that is capable of forming sum and carry outputs for addend and augend words of greater than one bit in length by operating on corresponding pairs of addend and augend bits in parallel, i.e. at the same time. Parallel adders normally incorporate carry lookahead logic to ensure that carry propagation between subsequent stages of addition does not limit addition speed. See also ADDER, SERIAL ADDER.
