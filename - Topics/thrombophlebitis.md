- $n$. inflammation of the wall of a vein (see PHLEBITIS) with secondary thrombosis occurring within the affected segment of vein. Pregnant women are more prone to thrombophlebitis because of physiological changes in the blood and the effects of pressure within the abdomen. It may involve superficial or deep veins of the legs (the latter being less common in pregnancy than the former). Deep vein thrombosis may precede pulmonary embolism.
