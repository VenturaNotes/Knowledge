- (logical expression) An expression in Boolean algebra, i.e. a well-formed formula of Boolean variables and constants linked by Boolean operators. An example is$$a \wedge(b \vee \neg c)$$Any combinational circuit can be modeled directly and completely by means of a Boolean expression, but this is not so of sequential circuits.
