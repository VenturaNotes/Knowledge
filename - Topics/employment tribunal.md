- Any of the bodies established under the UK employment protection legislation to hear disputes between employers and employees or trade unions relating to statutory terms and conditions of employment. For example, the tribunals hear complaints concerning unfair dismissal, redundancy, equal pay, and maternity rights. Tribunals may also hear complaints from members of trade unions concerning unjustifiable disciplining by their union. The tribunal often consists of a legally qualified chairperson and two independent lay members, but employment judges may also sit alone. Under the Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013 legal officers may decide certain claims, provided both parties agree. The tribunal differs from a civil court in that it cannot enforce its awards (this must be done by separate application to a court) and it can conduct its proceedings informally. Strict rules of evidence need not apply and the parties can present their own case or be represented by anyone they wish at their own expense. From 2013 fees must be paid by anyone bringing a claim. The tribunal has powers to declare a dismissal unfair and to award compensation; in some cases it may order the reinstatement or re-engagement of a dismissed employee.
