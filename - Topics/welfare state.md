- A state committed to ensuring for all its citizens at least some minimum standard of living, including housing, education, and medical services. The size of the welfare state varies across economies. Economies in Northern Europe tend to have larger welfare systems than those in Southern Europe, North America, and Asia. The welfare state also represents the ideal of a state that provides universal comprehensive support. The term can be used in a derogatory sense to describe over-dependence on welfare benefits and the stifling of individual initiative.
