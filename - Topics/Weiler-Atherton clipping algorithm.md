- A polygon clipping algorithm that is capable of clipping a concave polygon with interior holes to the boundaries of another concave polygon also with interior holes. (A concave polygon has an interior angle greater than $180^{\circ}$.) It is thus more general, though more complex, than the Sutherland-Hodgman clipping algorithm.
