- (production system) A programming language in which the programs consist of condition $\implies$ action rules; these rules are known as productions or production rules. The programs are processed by an interpreter which repeats the following operations: all rules whose conditions are satisfied are found (rule matching), one of them is selected (conflict resolution), and its action is called (rule firing). Such systems are often known as [[rule-based system|rule-based systems]] in artificial intelligence and form the basis of many expert systems.
