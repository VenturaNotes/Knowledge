- An alternative approach to human-resource management put forward by William Ouchi, as a way of enabling US companies to integrate aspects of the Japanese approach to human resource management (compare Theory X and Theory Y). The theory proposes: more secure employment, better career prospects, greater employee participation in decision making, greater emphasis on the team spirit, recognition of the contributions of employees, and the development of greater mutual respect between managers and employees. The implementation of this theory requires a commitment to consultation and to training by top management.
