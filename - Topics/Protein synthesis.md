## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The process by which living cells manufacture proteins from their constituent amino acids, in accordance with the genetic information carried in the DNA of the chromosomes. This information is encoded in messenger RNA, which is transcribed from DNA in the nucleus of the cell (see GENETIC CODE; TRANSCRIPTION): the sequence of amino acids in a particular protein is determined by the sequence of nucleotides in messenger RNA. At the ribosomes the information carried by messenger RNA is translated into the sequence of amino acids of the protein in the process of translation.
