- A niche application is a specialized program that is created with a specific purpose and targets a specific market or industry. These types of programs typically provide a specific service to their users or connect people who share similar interests. Niche apps often have social networking built into them and are optimized for mobile devices. An example of a niche app would be Dig, a dating app that was specifically designed for dog lovers to connect with other dog lovers.
