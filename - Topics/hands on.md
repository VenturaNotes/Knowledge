- A mode of operation of a system in which an operator is in control. The operator literally has hands on a keyboard and other switches to control the processes to be carried out by the system. The dependence on the capability of the operator to run a medium-size or large computer has been reduced by the introduction of supervisor programs or operating systems.
- When no operator intervention is required the mode of operation can be described as hands off.
