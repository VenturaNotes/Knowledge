- (flexihours) A system of working, especially in offices, in which employees are given a degree of flexibility in the hours they work. Provided they work an agreed number of hours per day, they may start or finish work at different times. The object is usually to reduce time spent in rush-hour travelling or to adjust work schedules to other demands, such as responsibility for children.
