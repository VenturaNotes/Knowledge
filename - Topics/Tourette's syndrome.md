- (TS, Gilles de la Tourette syndrome) a condition characterized by the simultaneous appearance of verbal and motor tics within one year. Motor tics can be simple (eye rolling, flicking, incomplete movements) or complex (involuntary movements consisting of several components, mostly involving the arms). Verbal tics can be simple (grunts, throat clearing) or complex (uttering of words or, in $30 \%$ of patients, involuntary obscene speech). Rarely, the patient may also involuntarily repeat the words or imitate the actions of others (see PALILALIA). The condition usually starts in childhood and commonly improves with age. The prevalence is about $1 \%$ with a male preponderance. There is a strong hereditary element. Drug treatment and psychological support are sometimes helpful. \[G. Gilles de la Tourette (1857-1904), French neurologist]
