- (Stokes-Cartan theorem) (generalized form) If M is a smooth orientable manifold with boundary $\partial M$ and $\upomega$ is a differential form on M, then $$\int_M d \upomega = \int_{\partial M} \upomega$$When M is 1-, 2-, or 3-dimensional, this gives the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus, Stokes' theorem, or the divergence theorem respectively.
