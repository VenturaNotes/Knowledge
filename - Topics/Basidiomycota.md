- A phylum of fungi, formerly classified as a class (Basidiomycetes) or a subdivision (Basidiomycotina). Sexual reproduction is by means of basidiospores produced externally on a club-shaped or cylindrical basidium. Basidia are often grouped together on fruiting structures, such as mushrooms, puffballs, and bracket fungi. Exceptions are the rusts and smuts, which do not produce obvious fruiting bodies.
