- The taking possession of property by a government, usually during a national emergency, with or without the consent of the owner. When the emergency has ended, the property may be derequisitioned, i.e. returned to its owner. A requisition differs from a compulsory purchase in that ownership does not pass in a requisition as it does in a compulsory purchase.
