- The shipment of goods from one port to another with a change of ship at an intermediate port. Transhipments are usually made because there is no direct service between the ports of shipment and destination, or because it is necessary for some political reason, e.g. wishing to conceal the port of shipment from the buyers, whose government may have embargoed goods from the country of that port.
