- n. a genus of large tropical parasitic flukes that are particularly prevalent in the Far East. The adults of P. westermani live in the human lungs, where they cause destruction and bleeding of the tissues (see PARAGONIMIASIS). However, they may also be found in other organs of the body. Eggs are passed out in the sputum and the larvae undergo their development in two other hosts, a snail and a crab.
