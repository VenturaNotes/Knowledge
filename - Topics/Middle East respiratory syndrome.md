- (MERS) a viral respiratory infection that was first identified in 2012. Humans seem to be infected most easily by contact with dromedary camels (hence the informal name camel flu), although human-to-human infection also occurs. Symptoms include fever, cough, and shortness of breath. Although the syndrome is often mild, death occurs in about a third of diagnosed cases. Most reported cases have been in the Arabian Peninsula, although there was a major outbreak in South Korea in 2015. At present there is no vaccine or treatment.
