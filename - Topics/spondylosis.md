- $n$. a spinal condition resulting from degeneration and flattening of the intervertebral discs in the cervical, thoracic, or lumbar regions. Symptoms include pain and restriction of movement, and in advanced cases tingling, numbness, and weakness may develop due to pressure on nerve roots. Spondylosis produces a characteristic appearance on X-ray, including narrowing of the space occupied by the disc and the presence of osteophytes; these features of the disease (radiological spondylosis) may not be accompanied by any signs and symptoms. Pain is relieved by analgesics, NSAIDs, and physiotherapy; painful movements are prevented by wearing a neck orthosis (when the neck region is affected) or a lumbosacral corset (for the lower spine). Very severe cases sometimes require surgical fusion.
