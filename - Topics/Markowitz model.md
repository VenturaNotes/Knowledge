- A method of selecting the optimum investment portfolio devised by H. M. Markowitz (1927$-$), who received the Nobel prize in Economics for this work in 1990. It assumes that investors are risk-averse$\textemdash$i.e. they are attracted by high average returns on an investment but dislike high standard deviations of returns. It concludes that investors should diversify as widely as possible and opt for the level of risk and return they find most acceptable by varying the proportions they borrow, lend, and invest in risky assets.
