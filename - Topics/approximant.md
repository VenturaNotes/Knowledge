- $n$. A consonant speech sound in which the organs of articulation approach each other, but not so closely as to cause audible friction. There are two major classes of approximants: semivowels such as the initial phonemes in the English words win and yes, and liquids such as the initial phonemes in the English words love and road. \[From Latin proximare to draw near or approach]
