- (routine maintenance) Maintenance performed on a regular basis, and intended to prevent failures or to detect incipient failures. An example of the former is routine lubrication and cleaning of devices that have moving magnetic media. An example of the latter is a marginal check in which electrical parameters may be varied to induce failures in marginally performing circuits. Compare REMEDIAL MAINTENANCE.
