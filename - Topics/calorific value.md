- The heat per unit mass produced by complete combustion of a given substance. Calorific values are used to express the energy values of fuels; usually these are expressed in megajoules per kilogram $\left(\mathrm{MJ}~ \mathrm{kg}^{-1}\right)$. They are also used to measure the energy content of foodstuffs; i.e. the energy produced when the food is oxidized in the body. The units here are kilojoules per gram $\left(\mathrm{kJ}~ \mathrm{g}^{-1}\right)$, although Calories (kilocalories) are often still used in nontechnical contexts.
