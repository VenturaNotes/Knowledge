- (universe) In marketing research, any complete group of entities sharing a common set of characteristics. For example, a population could be all the companies in the car-supplying industries or all the consumers in the South West of England. A population is the group from which a sample is taken. Population specification error is the error that results from an incorrect definition of the population from which the sample is chosen. For example, a population of consumers defined as buyers of Brand X may contain some non-buyers in the sample.
