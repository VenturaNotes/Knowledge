- (bond washing) The practice of buying gilt-edged securities after they have gone ex-dividend (see EX-) and selling them cum-dividend just before the next dividend is due. This procedure enables the investor to avoid receiving dividends, which in the UK are taxable as income, and to make a tax-free capital gain. Dividend stripping was once popular among higher-rate taxpayers but has now become of little interest since the rules regulating the taxation of accrued interest were changed.
