- a condition featuring recurrent episodes of acute distress, mental confusion, and fear of impending death or disaster. The core symptoms of anxiety are often present in an acute panic attack (palpitations, sweating, and tremor). Overbreathing (hyperventilation) often makes the attack worse and can cause tingling in the hands and arms and giddiness. These attacks last ten minutes or less and usually self-terminate; they are especially common in people with agoraphobia. Treatment is with antidepressant drugs and cognitive behavioral therapy. Anxiety management can also be helpful.

An anxiety disorder in DSM-5 characterized by recurrent, unexpected panic attacks, followed by persistent apprehension about further attacks, concern about the possible effects of the attacks (such as having a heart attack or going insane), or a significant alteration in behavior brought about by the attacks (such as resigning from a job). Panic disorder may occur with or without agoraphobia. PD abbrev.
