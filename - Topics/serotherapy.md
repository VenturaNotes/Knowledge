- $n$. the use of serum containing known antibodies (see ANTISERUM) to treat a patient with an infection or to confer temporary passive immunity upon a person at special risk. The use of antisera prepared in animals carries its own risks (for example, a patient may become hypersensitive to horse protein); the risk is reduced if the serum is taken from an immune human being.
