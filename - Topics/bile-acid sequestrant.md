- a drug that binds to bile acids, forming a complex that is excreted in the faeces. Bile acids are formed in the liver from cholesterol and the effect of loss of bile acids is a reduction in total body cholesterol and a decrease in low-density lipoprotein serum levels. These drugs, which include colestyramine and colestipol, are used to treat patients with abnormally high blood cholesterol levels who are liable to develop coronary heart disease.
