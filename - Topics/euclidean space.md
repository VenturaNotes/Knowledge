- (Cartesian space) The number line $\mathbb{R}$, plane $\mathbb{R}^2$, and 3-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be generalized to $n$-dimensional Euclidean or Cartesian space $\mathbb{R}^n$ with coordinates $(x_1, x_2,...,x_n$) on which the operations of addition and scalar multiplication are extended in the obvious way. While $\mathbb{R}^n$ is hard to visualize for $n > 3$, it provides a powerful framework in linear algebra and multivariable analysis
- If the points P and Q have coordinates $(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, and $(y_1, y_2, ...y_n)$ respectively, then the distance PQ can be defined to be equal to $$\sqrt{(x_1-y_1)^2+...+(x_n-y_n)^2.}$$
- Sometimes $n$-dimensional Euclidean space is denoted as $E^n$, signifying that space has no predetermined coordinates, no natural origin or axes. Once an origin, perpendicular axes, and unit length have been decided, coordinates may be assigned and $E^n$ can now be identified with $\mathbb{R}^n$
