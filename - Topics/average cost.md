- Total cost of production divided by quantity produced. Average cost is the sum of average fixed cost and average variable cost. Average fixed cost necessarily decreases with output. Average variable cost may decrease with output up to the point where limits to capacity become a constraint, after which it tends to rise. If average variable cost rises faster than average fixed cost falls, this produces a U-shaped average cost curve. Where a firm has multiple products average cost can be defined only if it is possible to attribute particular costs to particular products.

- (1) The average cost per unit of output calculated by dividing the total costs, both fixed costs and variable costs, by the total units of output. 
- (2) (AVCO; weighted-average cost) A method of valuing units of raw material or finished goods issued from stock; it involves recalculating the unit value to be used for pricing the issues after each new consignment of raw materials or finished goods has been added to the stock. The average cost is obtained by dividing the total stock value by the number of units in stock. Because the issues are at an average cost, it follows that the valuation of the closing stock should be made on the same average cost basis. The method may also be used in process costing to value the work in process at the end of an accounting period.
