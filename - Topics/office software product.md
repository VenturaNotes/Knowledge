## Source [^1]
- (office suite) A collection of items of software from a single supplier that is useful in an office environment and is sold as a single item. The components typically include a selection from a word processor, spreadsheet, presentation graphics package, meeting scheduler and appointment manager, email manager, and perhaps a database system as an optional extra. There are significant cost savings over buying the items separately or making a selection from different suppliers, and there may be compatibility advantages. Compare INTEGRATED OFFICE SYSTEM.
