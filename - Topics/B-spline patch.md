- A surface patch defined by B-spline curves in the same way that a Bézier patch is defined by Bézier curves. Given a characteristic polygon defined by vertices $\mathbf{r}_{i j}, i=0,1, \ldots p, j=0,1, \ldots q$, the B-spline patch is defined by$$\mathbf{r}(u, v)=\sum_{i=0}^{p} \sum_{j=0}^{q} \mathbf{r}_{i j} B_{\rho, i+1}(u) B_{\rho, j+1}(v)$$where $B$ is the B-spline basis function of degree $\rho$.
