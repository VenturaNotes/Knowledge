- The system by which repayment of a loan after $n$ periods requires payment of a sum equal to the principal plus $n$ times the interest payable for a single period. If the principal is $P$ and the interest rate per period is $r$, at the end of $n$ periods payment of $P(1+n r)$ is required. As $n$ increases, the proportional rate of return to the lender goes down, as the proportional return for the $(n+1)$th period is $r P /[(1+n r) P]$, which is a decreasing function of $n$. Simple interest is very rarely used, except for loans of very short duration.
