- An equivalence class associated with a special kind of relation defined on functions. Let$$F=\{f \mid D \rightarrow A\}$$be a set of functions mapping elements from some domain $D$ into some set $A$, which can be regarded as an alphabet. With each function $f$ in $F$ is associated a weight $w(f)$, defined as the formal multiplication of all the images $f(x)$ under $f$. In effect $w(f)$ describes the number of occurrences of the different images in $A$.
- An equivalence relation can then be defined between two functions of $F$ in such a way that equivalent functions have equivalent weights, though the reverse is not in general true. The patterns of $F$ are the equivalence classes that emerge from this equivalence relation.
- The weight of a pattern is just the weight of any member of that pattern; the weight of the equivalence class $[f]$ containing $f$ is just $w(f)$. The formal sum of the weights $w(f)$ taken over all the equivalence classes in $F$ gives the pattern inventory of the set $F$. An important theorem due mainly to George PÃ³lya indicates the close link between pattern inventory and cycle index polynomial.
- These ideas are often applied in combinatorics and switching theory. For example, a pattern inventory can indicate the number of essentially different wiring diagrams or logic circuits needed to realize the different possible logic functions.
