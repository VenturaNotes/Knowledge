- An optical device consisting of two quartz prisms; the first, cut parallel to the optic axis, receives the light; the second, with the optic axis at right angles, transmits the ordinary ray without deviation but the extraordinary ray is deflected and can be absorbed by a screen. The device can be used to produce plane-polarized light and it can also be used with ultraviolet radiation.
