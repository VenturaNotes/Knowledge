- A method of determining the depreciation charge on a fixed asset against profits for an accounting period. The asset to be depreciated is revalued each year; the fall in the value is the amount of depreciation to be written off the asset and charged against the profit and loss account for the period. It is often used for such depreciating assets as loose tools or a mine from which materials are extracted.
