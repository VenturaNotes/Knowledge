## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Similar to list comprehension but crates a generator instead of a list. It uses `()`
	- #question What kind of properties does a generator object have which makes it a generator?
### Format
```python
(expression for item in iterable if condition)
```
- Reads as
	- "Do the `expression` for the `item` in the `iterable` if the `condition` is satisfied"
