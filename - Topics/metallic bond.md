## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A chemical bond of the type holding together the atoms in a solid metal or alloy. In such solids, the atoms are considered to be ionized, with the positive ions occupying lattice positions. The valence electrons are able to move freely (or almost freely) through the lattice, forming an 'electron gas'. The bonding force is electrostatic attraction between the positive metal ions and the electrons. The existence of free electrons accounts for the good electrical and thermal conductivities of metals. See also energy bands.
