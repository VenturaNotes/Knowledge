- An electronic logic gate whose output is logic 0 (false) only when any one of its inputs is logic 1 (true) and all the others are logic 0 , otherwise the output is logic 1 . It implements the logical operation of equivalence and has the same truth table. It is thus also known as an equivalence gate. Like the exclusive-OR gate it can be used as a simple digital comparator. The diagram shows the circuit symbol and truth table of a two-input gate.
