- In economic theory, an alteration in the allocation of resources is said to be Pareto efficient when it leaves at least one person better off and nobody worse off. A state of Pareto optimality occurs when no further Pareto-efficient changes can be made. The concept was first described by the Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923). Compare Kaldor-Hicks EFFICIENCY.
