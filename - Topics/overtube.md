- $n$. a semirigid plastic tube (25-45 cm long) designed to fit over the shaft of an endoscope in order to minimize the risk of trauma. It can be used with a gastroscope, cholangioscope, enteroscope, or colonoscope (see COLONOSCOPY). An overtube is placed over the shaft of an endoscope prior to its insertion; once the endoscope is in the desired place, the overtube is lubricated and slid into position over the shaft. It is commonly used in combination with a gastroscope for the removal of ingested foreign bodies (especially those with sharp or serrated edges that may cause significant trauma as they are being extracted).
