## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An alternative expression for an algebra. Sometimes there is a technical difference: algebras are always sets with constants and functions; algebraic structures are sometimes algebras to which are added relations. A common term for this latter case is [[algebraic system]] (or model).

## Source[^2]
- The term used to describe an abstract concept defined as consisting of certain elements with binary operations satisfying given axioms. Thus groups, rings, fields, vector spaces and modules are algebraic structures. The aim is to recognize similarities that appear in different contexts within mathematics and to encapsulate these by means of a set of axioms.
