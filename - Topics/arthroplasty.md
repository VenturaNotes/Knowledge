- $n$. surgical refashioning of a diseased joint to relieve pain and to maintain or regain movement. An excision (or resection) arthroplasty involves the excision of enough bone to create a gap at which movement can occur. In an interposition arthroplasty a biological or artificial barrier is placed between the two bony surfaces. In a total arthroplasty both joint surfaces are replaced by prostheses; in a hemiarthroplasty, performed for some fractures of the hip and shoulder, only one end of a joint is replaced.
