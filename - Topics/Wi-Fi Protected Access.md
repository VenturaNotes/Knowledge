- Wi-Fi protected access (WPA) is a specific type of security that is used for computers that have wireless internet. Specifically, WPA took over for Wired EquivalentÂ Privacy (WEP) in 1999. It used the latest technology at the time to provide enhanced security and encryption. This, in turn, protected the information of users who were using WPA and made it harder for hackers and other bad actors to alter data as it was being sent.
