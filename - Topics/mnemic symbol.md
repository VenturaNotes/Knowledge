- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a hysterical symptom arising from a memory of a trauma or a conflict that has been repressed. In a key passage in an article on 'The Neuro-Psychoses of Defence' (1894), Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) described it as follows: 'By this means the ego succeeds in freeing itself from the contradiction; but instead, it has burdened itself with a mnemic symbol which finds a lodgement in consciousness, like a sort of parasite, either in the form of an unresolvable motor innervation or as a constantly recurring hallucinatory sensation' (Standard Edition, III, pp. 45-61, at p. 49).
