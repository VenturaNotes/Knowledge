- The risk when selling goods on credit that the purchaser may fail to make payments when they become due. Credit for short periods can be given against a trade bill, which can be discounted, so that the seller receives cash immediately and passes the credit risk to whoever buys the bill. For longer-term credits it may be possible to insure the risk, possibly via an official agency such as the UK Export Credits Guarantee Department or the US Export-Import Bank.
