- (LPC Scale) A measure used to identify the extent to which a leader is predominantly task-motivated or relationship-motivated. The participant is asked to think of the co-worker with whom he or she has had the most problems in the past and to rate this person on a series of dimensions, such as intelligent-unintelligent, honest-dishonest, and so on. A total score is then derived from these ratings. Leaders who score their least preferred co-worker relatively highly are assumed to be relationship-motivated; those who are more critical are assumed to be task-motivated. See also CONTINGENCY THEORIES OF LEADERSHIP; LEADERSHIP STYLE.
