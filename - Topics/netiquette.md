- (Informal) (network etiquette) The guidelines that constitute good behavior on a network, especially the Internet, and that, like all forms of etiquette, tend to be determined by a self-appointed group. A breach of netiquette, such as spamming, may attract a flame as a response. Netiquette should not be confused with the behavior formalized in an acceptable use policy, contractual commitments, or the results of properly enacted legislation.
