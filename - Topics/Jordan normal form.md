- A block diagonal matrix where every block is a Jordan block. Every complex square matrix is similar to a matrix in Jordan normal form. The geometric multiplicity of an eigenvalue $\lambda$ equals the number of Jordan blocks involving $\lambda$; the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda$ is the sum of those block's orders. The characteristic polynomial of the matrix is the product of all the block's characteristic polynomials; the minimal polynomial of the matrix is the product of the each eigenvalue's largest block's characteristic polynomials. Two such matrices are: $$\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0& 0\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 1 &0 \\ 0&0&0&0&2&1 \\ 0&0&0&0&0&2\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0& 0\\ 0 & 0 & 2 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 2 & 0 &0 \\ 0&0&0&0&2&1 \\ 0&0&0&0&0&2\end{bmatrix}$$
- Both matrices have characteristic polynomials $(x-1)^2(x-2)^4$; the minimal polynomials are $(x-1)(x-2)^4$ and $(x-1)(x-2)^2$ respectively.
