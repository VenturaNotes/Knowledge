- a mental disorder characterized by systematic delusions and commonly auditory hallucinations, but without any other marked symptoms of mental illness; it was formerly known as paraphrenia. The only loss of contact with reality is in areas affected by the delusions and hallucinations. It is typically seen in the elderly and can also occur in people with severe hearing impediments. Some people develop other symptoms of schizophrenia over time but in many the personality remains intact over years. Antipsychotic medication is often useful in treating the illness.
