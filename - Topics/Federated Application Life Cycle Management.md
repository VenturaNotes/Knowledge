- Federated application life cycle management (FALM; also known as federated ALM) is a federated architecture approach that deals with multiple phases in an application life cycle, from the first stage of development to its final release. Federated architecture is a type of architecture that integrates decentralized and autonomous systems and processes. The components can still operate autonomously but also have integration between them. This approach helps avoid the possibility of information becoming isolated and therefore useless.
