- A rich internet application (RIA) refers to the technologies that let organizations build applications for rich, responsive user experiences. The term, inconsistently used in the software development industry, is more of a concept than a particular set of tools. It describes different approaches and technologies that span browsers and other subcategories. These include the plug-in enhanced browser, HTML5-powered browser, and JavaScript-enhanced browser.
