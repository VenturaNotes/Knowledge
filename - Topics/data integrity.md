- The maintenance of, and the assurance of, data accuracy and consistency over its entire life-cycle.
## Source[^2]
- The accuracy, completeness, and quality of data as it's maintained over time

## Source[^3]
- Resistance to alteration of data stored in a computer by system errors, so that only authorized and proper alteration occurs. Data integrity is a general concept with a number of different facets. Most obviously, it is a measure of the reliability of data read from magnetic media, in terms of the absence of undetected errors (see ERROR RATE). However, it is also a property of structured data (e.g. a database) that ensures that collections of data items are consistent with one another, particularly when copies of the same data are kept at different locations.
## Source[^4]
- The accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the information held on a computer database. Data integrity can be compromised by human error (e.g. in inputting), software or mechanical faults, and system errors (e.g. inadequate procedures to make sure that changes made to local files are transferred to master files). Various checks, mechanisms, and standards have been developed to protect data integrity.
