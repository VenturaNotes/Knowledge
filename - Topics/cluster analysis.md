- The general name for a number of different methods for grouping objects that have similar characteristics into sets or 'clusters'. Cluster analysis is used to explore data by sorting different objects into sets so that the degree of association between two objects is maximal if they belong to the same set. It can be used to discover structures in data but provides no explanation for the structure.

## Source[^2]
- Any statistical technique for grouping a set of units into clusters of similar units on the basis of observed qualitative and/or quantitative measurements, usually on several variables. Cluster analysis aims to fulfill simultaneously the conditions that units in the same cluster should be similar, and that units in different clusters should be dissimilar. It is not usually possible to satisfy both conditions fully, and no single method can be recommended as best for all sets of data. Among other desirable properties of clusters are that some variables should be constant for all units within a cluster, which makes it possible to provide a simple scheme for identification of units in terms of clusters.
- Most cluster analysis methods require a similarity or distance measure to be defined between each pair of units, so that the units similar to a given unit may be identified. Similarity measures have been proposed for both quantitative (continuous) variables and qualitative (discrete) variables, using a weighted mean of similarity scores over all variables considered. The term distance comes from a geometric representation of data as points in multidimensional space: small distances correspond to large similarities.
- [[Hierarchical cluster analysis]] methods form clusters in sequence, either by amalgamation of units into clusters and clusters into larger clusters, or by subdivision of clusters into smaller clusters and single units. Whichever direction is chosen, the results can be represented by a [[dendrogram]] or family tree in which the units at one level are nested within units at all higher levels.
- [[Nonhierarchical cluster analysis]] methods allocate units to a fixed number of clusters so as to optimize some criterion representing a desired property of clusters. Such methods may be iterative, involving transfer of units between clusters until no further improvement can be achieved. The solution for a given number of clusters need bear little relation to the solution for a larger or smaller number.
- Cluster analysis is often used in conjunction with other methods of multivariate analysis to describe the structure of a complex set of data.

## Source[^3]
- The task of assigning objects to recognizable groups called clusters, according to various measurements. These clusters commonly show correlation between different attributes. The notion of a cluster cannot be precisely given, and many different algorithms are hence used in cluster analysis.
