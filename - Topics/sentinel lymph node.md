- the first lymph node to show evidence of metastasis (spread) of a malignant tumor (e.g. breast cancer) via the lymphatic system. Absence of cancer cells in the sentinel node indicates that more distal lymph nodes will also be free of metastasis. In breast cancer, the change in practice to perform axillary lymph node dissection only if the sentinel node contains metastatic tumor has reduced the risk of arm lymphoedema. Similarly, in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, the sentinel lymph node procedure is used as an alternative to neck dissection.
