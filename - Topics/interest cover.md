- (fixed-charge-coverage ratio) A ratio showing the number of times interest charges are covered by earnings before interest and tax (see EBIT). For example, a company with interest charges of $£ 12$ million and earnings before interest and tax of $£ 36$ million would have its interest covered three times. The ratio is one way of analyzing gearing and reflects the vulnerability of a company to changes in interest rates or profit fluctuations. A highly geared company, which has a low interest cover, may find that an increase in the interest rate will mean that it has no earnings after interest charges with which to provide a dividend to shareholders.
