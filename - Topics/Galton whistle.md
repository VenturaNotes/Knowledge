- $n$. An instrument for emitting high-pitched tones and ultrasound for determining the upper limits of the audibility range in humans and other animals. The original version, which the English explorer, amateur scientist, and psychologist Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911) first described in 1876, was a whistle attached to a hollow walking-stick, with a rubber bulb for its operation in the handle, which he used to experiment on animals at London Zoo and elsewhere.
