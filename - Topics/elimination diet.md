- a diet in which foods suspected of not being tolerated are removed for a period of time and then reintroduced sequentially to identify any that then precipitate symptoms (e.g. FODMAPS). An exclusion diet is a variant of this, in which a single food is excluded and symptoms monitored for any improvements (e.g. a lactose-free diet).
