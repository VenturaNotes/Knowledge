- Redistribution that takes the form of the gift of goods or services rather than cash. The benefit of in-kind redistribution is that it removes choice from the recipient and helps ensure that they consume the intended goods and services. For example, the provision of food vouchers to households on low incomes ensures they eat, whereas a gift of cash may be spent on goods other than food. Underlying these observations are merit goods arguments.
