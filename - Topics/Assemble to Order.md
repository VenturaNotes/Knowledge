- Assemble to order (ATO) is a business strategy for companies that provide physical products. In ATO, products are made from a particular range of components that are manufactured in advance and left unassembled until a customer places an order. Once an order is placed, the components are put together to match the customer's requirements. An example is computer hardware providers that stock a range of components and put them together as and when orders are received.
