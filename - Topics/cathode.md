## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A negative electrode. In electrolysis cations are attracted to the cathode. In vacuum electronic devices electrons are emitted by the cathode and flow to the anode. It is therefore from the cathode that electrons flow in these devices. However, in a primary or secondary cell the cathode is the electrode that spontaneously becomes negative during discharge, and from which therefore electrons emerge.
