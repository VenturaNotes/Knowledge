- A futures contract in currencies, interest rates (see INTEREST-RATE FUTURES), or other financial assets. The contract is a standard one, which is exchange-traded. Until about 1970 trading in financial futures did not exist, although futures and options were dealt in widely on commodity markets. However, instantaneous trading across the world coupled with accelerated international capital flows combined to produce great volatility in interest rates, stock-market prices, and currency exchanges. The result has been an environment in which organizations and individuals responsible for managing large sums need a financial futures and options market both to manage risks effectively and as a source of additional profit. In the UK financial futures and options are traded on the LIFFE (now effectively integrated with ICE Futures Europe). See also HEDGE; INDEX FUTURES; PORTFOLIO INSURANCE.

- Futures contracts in currencies, interest rates, or stock indices. Futures contracts, like forward contracts, commit both sides to a transaction on a future date at a pre-arranged price. Futures contracts are traded in futures markets on organized exchanges. These contracts can be used either for hedging to reduce the risks traders are exposed to, or for speculation, taking on extra risk for the sake of expected profits. Financial futures are traded in the UK on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange.
