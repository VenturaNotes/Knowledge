## Source [^1]
- The passage of material from the inside of the cell to the cell surface within membrane-bound vesicles. The membranes of the vesicles fuse with the plasma membrane, a process involving various docking proteins in both the vesicle coat and target membrane. The vesicle contents are then released to the exterior. Exocytosis is used both for the removal of waste material from the cell and for secretion; for example of mucus by goblet cells. Compare ENDOCYTOSIS.
