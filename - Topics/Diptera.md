- $n$. a large group of insects, including mosquitoes, gnats, midges, house flies, and tsetse flies, that possess a single pair of wings. The mouthparts of many species, e.g. mosquitoes and tsetse flies, are specialized for sucking blood; these forms are important in the transmission of disease (see VECTOR). See also FLY.

- An order of insects comprising the true, or two-winged, flies. Flies possess only one pair of wings$\textemdash$the forewings; the hindwings are modified to form small clublike halteres that function as balancing organs. Typically fluid feeders, flies have mouthparts adapted for piercing and sucking or for lapping; the diet includes nectar, sap, decaying organic matter, and blood. Some species prey on insects; others are parasitic. Dipteran larvae (maggots) are typically wormlike with an inconspicuous head. They undergo metamorphosis via a pupal stage to the adult form. Many flies or their larvae are serious pests, either by feeding on crops (e.g. fruit flies) or as vectors of disease organisms (e.g. the house fly (Musca domestica) and certain mosquitoes).
