- nerve tissue of the central nervous system that is paler in color than the associated grey matter because it contains more nerve fibres and thus larger amounts of the insulating material myelin. In the brain the white matter lies within the grey layer of cerebral cortex; in the spinal cord it is between the arms of the X -shaped central core of grey matter.
