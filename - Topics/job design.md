## Source [^1]
- The process of putting together the various elements of work that constitute an operating system, to form jobs that individuals will perform (see WORK STUDY). The process involves a balance between the needs of the individual to be healthy, safe, and motivated and the needs of the organization to be economic, efficient, and effective. There is no single solution: each compromise will reflect the strategy and management philosophy favoured by a particular organization.
