- $n$. discomfort caused by exposure to light. In most cases the light simply aggravates already existing discomfort from eye disease; contraction of the eyelids and other reactions aimed at avoiding the light follow. Photophobia may be associated with dilation of the pupils as a result of eye drops or with migraine, measles, German measles, meningitis, iritis, or disruption of the sensitive corneal epithelium.
