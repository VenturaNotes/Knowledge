## Source [^1]
- A hormone produced by the adrenal glands (see CORTICOSTEROID); it controls excretion of sodium by the kidneys and forms part of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which regulates blood volume and blood pressure (see RENIN). Aldosterone promotes the reabsorption of sodium ions from the collecting ducts and distal tubules of nephrons in the kidneys, thereby causing enhanced reabsorption of water. See also angiotensin.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A corticosteroid hormone belonging to the mineralocorticoid group, secreted by the adrenal cortex in response to the kidney hormone angiotensin II, involved in the regulation of mineral and water balance by its reciprocal action in causing the kidneys to retain sodium and excrete potassium while forming urine from venous blood. \[From ald(ehyde) + ster(ol) + (ket)one]
## Source[^3]
- $n$. a steroid hormone (see CORTICOSTEROID) that is synthesized and released by the adrenal cortex and acts on the kidney to regulate salt (potassium and sodium) and water balance.
