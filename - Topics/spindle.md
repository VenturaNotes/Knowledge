- $n$. a collection of fibres seen in a cell when it is dividing. The fibres radiate from the two ends (poles) and meet at the centre (the equator) giving a structure shaped like two cones placed base to base. It plays an important part in chromosome movement in mitosis and meiosis and is also involved in division of the cytoplasm.
