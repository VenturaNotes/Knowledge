- $n$. A subsystem of the visual system that enables the movement of objects in the environment to be computed from the image-retinal system, discounting movements of the eyes and head, necessary because movements of images across the retinas provide insufficient information for determining movement of objects in the environment, given that eye and head movements cause retinal images to move even when the objects themselves are stationary. See also REAFFERENCE.
