- ITCH protocol is a data feed protocol that stock market subscribers can use to get fast quotes on stock prices on the stock exchange. A basic stock quote will typically include the asking price, stock's bid, last traded price, and the stock volume traded. The ITCH protocol takes nanoseconds to relay real-time quote information to a network, which is the key to winning trades at an optimal price before the market shifts. ITCH protocol is commonly used on NASDAQ-owned liquidity pools and exchanges, as well as other trading platforms such as the ASX Trade.
