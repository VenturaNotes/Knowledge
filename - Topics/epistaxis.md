- $n$. bleeding from the nose, which is a very common condition. Although there is usually no obvious underlying cause, epistaxis can be caused by low-grade bacterial infection of the front of the nose, hypertension, clotting disorders, or tumors of the nose or sinuses. Treatments include pinching the bottom part of the nostrils together, cauterizing the bleeding vessel, or packing the nose with preformed packs, antiseptic gauze, or specially designed inflatable balloons. Occasionally surgery is required to interrupt the flow of blood to the nose. See Little's AREA; KiESSELBACH's PLEXUS.
