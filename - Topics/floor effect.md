- $n$. In statistics and measurement theory, an artificial lower limit on the value that a variable can attain, causing the distribution of scores to be skewed. For example, the distribution of scores on an ability test will be skewed by a floor effect if the test is much too difficult for many of the respondents and many of them obtain zero scores. Also called a basement effect. Compare CEILING EFFECT.
