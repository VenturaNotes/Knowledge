- A sale made on the basis of sample, i.e. that the quality and condition of the bulk of the goods will be at least as good as that of the selling sample. In contracts in which goods are sold by sample, the contract may stipulate how and by whom the bulk should be sampled and what tests should be used to compare it to the selling sample. The contract will also usually lay down the procedure to be adopted if the bulk sample is not as good as the selling sample. Compare SALE AS SEEN; SALE BY DESCRIPTION.
