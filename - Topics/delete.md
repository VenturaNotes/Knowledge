- (1) To remove or obliterate a record or item of data, such as by overwriting data on disk or tape with new data or null characters. 
- (2) To remove permanently an object, such as a character, word, paragraph, or graphic, from a document, or to remove an entire document file from permanent storage. In either case there is usually a period of grace during which the decision to delete can be rescinded, and after which the action is irreversible. 
- (3) One of the basic actions performed on sets that, when applied in the form$$delete(el,S)$$removes the element $e l$ from $S$; if $e l$ was not present in $S$ the action has no effect on the membership of $S$. See also OPERATIONS ON SETS.
