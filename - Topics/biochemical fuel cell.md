## Source [^1]
- A system that exploits biological reactions for the conversion of biomass (chemical energy) to electricity (electrical energy). One potential application is the generation of electricity from industrial waste and sewage. Methyltrophic organisms (i.e. organisms that use methane or methanol as their sole carbon sources) are being investigated for their potential use in biochemical fuel cells.
