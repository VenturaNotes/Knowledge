- The idea that data from multiple sensors should be combined so as to remove or reduce noise and uncertainty and increase confidence in the result. Redundancy, majority voting, and probability methods can be used for sets of simple sensors of the same modality, but major research issues are involved where the sensors are complex, as in vision, or operate across different modalities. See also DATA FUSION.
