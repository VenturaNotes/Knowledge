- A core banking system is a back-end system that handles tasks such as reporting, deposits, loans, and credit processing using an IT infrastructure that extends throughout several bank branches. This centralized system makes it possible for customers of the bank to access and manage their accounts from various platforms (mobile apps, websites, and ATMs) without the need to visit one of the bank's branches.
