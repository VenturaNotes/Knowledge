- a variety of leukaemia in which the type of blood cell that proliferates abnormally originates in the blood-forming (myeloid) tissue of the bone marrow. Myeloid leukaemias may be acute or chronic and may involve any one of the cells produced by the marrow. Blood cells in patients with chronic myeloid leukaemia contain a reciprocal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 (see PhiladelphIA CHROMOSOME); molecular characterization of the translocation has led to the development of specific drugs to block the effects of this abnormality (see TYROSINE KINASE INHIBITOR).
