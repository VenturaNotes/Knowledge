- $n$. A type of center-surround receptive field characteristic of neurons belonging to blobs in the primary visual cortex in which stimulation of the center with light of a particular range of wavelengths elicits neural responses and stimulation with the complementary-color wavelength inhibits responses, whereas stimulation of the immediately surrounding area elicits the reverse responses, the commonest type, involving red $(r)$ and green $(g)$, being a $r^{+} g^{-}$center surrounded by a $r^{-} g^{+}$ring.
