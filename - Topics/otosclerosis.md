- (otospongiosis) n. a disorder causing conductive deafness in adult life. An overgrowth of the bone of the inner ear leads to the third ear ossicle (the stapes) becoming fixed to the fenestra ovalis, which separates the middle and inner ears, so that sounds cannot be conducted to the inner ear. Deafness is progressive and may become very severe, but treatment by surgery is usually highly effective (see FENESTRATION; STAPEDECTOMY). Nonsurgical treatments include fluoride tablets and the provision of suitable hearing aids.
