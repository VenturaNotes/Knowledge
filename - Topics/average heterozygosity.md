- $n$. A measure of the genetic variability within a population, being the average proportion of organisms that are heterozygous for a specified set of gene loci. Low genetic variability, such as is found for example among cheetahs in Africa, can result from an evolutionary bottleneck and can make the species vulnerable to extinction.
