## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A method used in computer graphics for producing photorealistic images but originating from thermal engineers in the 1950s. The scene is divided into many small objects and accurate modelling of diffuse interreflection between objects is calculated (see DIFFUSE REFLECTION). This results in a large number of simultaneous equations to be solved, so the method is not the fastest available. The energy input to the system comes from the light sources. See also CLUSTERING.
