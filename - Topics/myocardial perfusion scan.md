- (thallium scan) a method to detect and quantify myocardial ischaemia. An intravenously injected radionuclide that is taken up by normal heart muscle can be imaged using a gamma camera. Areas of scar due to myocardial infarction emit little or no radioactivity and are seen as 'cold spots'. Exercise is mimicked by infusing drugs to increase the heart rate in order to provoke cold spots in the diagnosis of ischaemic heart disease.
