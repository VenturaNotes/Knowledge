- An order by a court that a person shall do, or refrain from doing, a particular act. This is an equitable remedy that may be granted by the court wherever 'just and convenient'. An interim injunction, lasting only until the main action is heard, may be granted on the application of one party without the other being present if there is great urgency. Prohibitory injunctions forbid the doing of a particular act; mandatory injunctions order a person to do some act. Failure to obey an injunction is contempt of court and punishable by a fine or imprisonment.
