- (NHS) The UK system of state-financed medical treatment, covering general practitioner (GP) services, pharmaceuticals, hospitals, and dentistry. NHS treatment is available to all; some forms of treatment are charged for, with exemptions for children, pensioners, and those on very low incomes. The NHS makes some use of an internal market based on fund-holding GP practices and hospital trusts.
## Source[^2]
- (NHS) (in Britain) a comprehensive service offering therapeutic and preventive medical and surgical care, including the prescription and dispensing of medicines, spectacles, and medical and dental appliances. Exchequer funds pay for the services of doctors, nurses, and other professionals, as well as residential costs in NHS hospitals, and meet a substantial part of the cost of the medicines and appliances. Legislation enacted in 1946 was implemented in 1948 and the services were subjected to substantial reorganization in 1974 and again in 1982, 1991, 1999, and in 2013 as a result of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. In England overall responsibility is vested in the Secretary of State for Health. Responsibility for commissioning most services is held by clinical commissioning groups, consisting of GPs in a local area, and commissioning for primary care services and some specialized services is undertaken by NHS England. Public health functions are largely delivered by local authorities, though some specialist functions are provided by Public Health England. The relationship between the Secretary of State for Health and the NHS also changed in 2013. The Secretary of State for Health, via the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC), no longer has direct control of the day-to-day operation of the NHS. This has passed to NHS England. However, the DHSC continues to provide strategic leadership for the NHS.
