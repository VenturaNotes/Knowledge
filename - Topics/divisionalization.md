- (1) The splitting up of a large organization into separate divisions, based on the products or services provided or on the geographical location of a particular plant. Although some management functions are repeated separately in each division, and economies of scale are not maximized, many large organizations that encompass a diversity of activities are structured in this way. Because decision making is decentralized to the divisional managers, a swift response to a change in markets is possible. Coordination between divisions is achieved by a central management. See DECENTRALIZATION. 
- (2) The process of transforming the subsidiary organizations in a group into divisions of a single integrated company.
