- a personality disorder characterized by a tendency to act impulsively without consideration of the consequences, unpredictable and capricious mood, a tendency towards outbursts of emotion, inability to control behavioral explosions, quarrelsome behavior, and conflict with others. There is an impulsive type, with particular emphasis on impulsivity and quarrelsome behavior, especially when criticized; and a borderline type, with an emphasis on disturbance and uncertainty about self-image (including sexual preference), liability to become involved in intense and unstable relationships, excessive efforts to avoid abandonment, recurrent threats or acts of self-harm, and chronic feelings of emptiness. Treatments include cognitive analytical therapy (see COGNITIVE THERAPY), antipsychotic medication, and occasionally SSRIs and lithium. In DSM-5 the disorder is called borderline personality disorder.
