- HiPPO is the acronym for the highest paid personâ€™s opinion or the highest paid person in the office. HiPPO is used to describe how some companies make decisions by deferring to the opinion of the person with the highest pay rate. However, referring to the highest paid or most senior employee when making business decisions is not necessarily the best way to run a company. Since past success is not a definitive indicator of future success, data-driven decision-making is a more optimal way to facilitate a businesses decision-making processes. Most teams default to the HiPPO in the room because most junior professionals lack the confidence to offer their opinion, challenge the assumptions of senior employees, or give honest feedback to their team.
