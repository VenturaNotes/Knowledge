## Source [^1]
- Describing or involving the form of electromagnetic signal that is carried by a waveguide with a cross section that is large compared with the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave. The wave can propagate in directions at an angle to the axis of the waveguide, undergoing a series of internal reflections along its length. This causes a gradual degradation of the signal. See also FIBRE OPTICS, MONOMODE.
