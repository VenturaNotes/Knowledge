- A substance or other stimulus that triggers the hypersensitive response in a plant (see Hypersensitivity). Most elicitors are polysaccharides, small proteins, or lipids associated with the fungal or bacterial cell wall. However, pectic fragments resulting from microbial damage to the plant's own cell walls may also act as elicitors. See immunITY (sense 2).
