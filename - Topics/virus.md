## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Program code written to replicate by attaching copies of itself to other objects within the system, and normally also having a detrimental effect. This may range from generation of irritating messages, through denial of service, to corruption or complete destruction of data. A [[program virus]] will seek out and copy itself into other program files whenever a previously infected program is run. A boot sector virus copies itself into that sector of a disk and spreads whenever a system is boot loaded from an infected disk. Viruses are spread when infected programs or disks are transferred to previously clean systems. See also LOGIC BOMB, TROJAN HORSE, WORM.

- $n$. a minute particle that is capable of replication but only within living cells. Viruses are too small to be visible with a light microscope and too small to be trapped by filters. They infect animals, plants, and microorganisms (see BACTERIOPHAGE). Each consists of a core of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein shell. Some bear an outer lipid capsule. Viruses cause many diseases, including the common cold, influenza, measles, mumps, chickenpox, herpes, AIDS, polio, and rabies. Antiviral drugs are effective against some of them, and many viral diseases are controlled by means of vaccines. $\textemdash$viral adj.

- A particle that is too small to be seen with a light microscope or to be trapped by filters but is capable of independent metabolism and reproduction within a living cell. Outside its host cell a virus is completely inert. A mature virus (a virion) typically ranges in size from 20 to 600 nm in diameter. It consists of a core of nucleic acid (DNA or RNA) surrounded by a protein coat (see CAPSID). Some (the enveloped viruses) bear an outer envelope consisting of proteins and lipids. Inside its host cell the virus initiates the synthesis of viral proteins and undergoes replication. The new virions are released when the host cell disintegrates. Viruses are parasites of animals, plants, and some bacteria (see BACTERIOPHAGE). Viral diseases of animals include the common cold, influenza, AIDS, herpes, hepatitis, polio, and rabies (see adenovirus; arbovirus; herpesvirus; hiv; MYXOVIRUS; PAPOVAVIRUS; PICORNAVIRUS; POXVIRUS); some viruses are also implicated in the development of cancer (see retrovirus). Plant viral diseases include various forms of yellowing and blistering of leaves and stems (see tobacco mosaic virus). Antiviral drugs are effective against certain viral diseases and vaccines (if available) provide protection against others. See also interferon; NUCLEOCYTOPLASMIC LARGE DNA VIRUS; PANDORAVIRUS. See Feature.
### Viruses
- The first evidence that certain diseases could be caused by agents smaller than bacteria was published in 1892 by Russian microbiologist Dmitri Ivanowski, who showed that an agent capable of passing through a filter for bacteria could cause tobacco mosaic disease in plants. A few years later, Dutch microbiologist Martinus Beijerinck (1851-1931) confirmed that this agent had certain properties of living things and called it a 'filterable virus'.
- Subsequently many other diseases of plants and animals were shown to be caused by these agents, which came to be called simply viruses. The term bacteriophage (often shortened to phage) for bacterial viruses was coined in 1917 by French scientist F. d'Herelle. Today thousands of different viruses have been discovered, and a wealth of knowledge exists about their structure and mode of life. Virusinfected cells have proved extremely useful experimental systems for studying aspects of cell metabolism, including DNA replication and protein synthesis, and viruses are commonly used as vectors for cloning DNA.
#### Structure
- Virus particles (virions) come in various shapes and sizes, ranging from about 20 nm (e.g. parvoviruses) to 1500 nm for Pithovirus, a nucleocytoplasmic large DNA virus. Essentially they fall into two structural classes$\textemdash$helical and icosahedral$\textemdash$depending on how the viral nucleic acid and protein subunits of the capsid are arranged.

	- Descriptions
		- In rod-shaped viruses, such as the tobacco mosaic virus, the protein subunits form a helical array and the nucleic acid (RNA) runs along an internal groove
		- The capsid of an icosahedral virus, such as human adenovirus, takes the form of a polyhedron with 20 triangular faces (an icosahedron). The projecting protein fibres attach to surface receptors of their host cell in the initial phase of infection.
		- Some bacteriophages, such as the T4 phage, have a more complex structure. The capsid is equipped with a hollow helical tail and tail fibers. After the tail fibers attach tot he surface of a host cell, the tail contracts and injects the viral DNA into the host bacterium. 

#### Baltimore classification
- A common method of classifying viruses is based on the nature of their genetic material (DNA or RNA) and how they convert that genetic information into viral messenger RNA (mRNA). It was devised by US biologist David Baltimore (1938- ). The viral mRNA strand that is translated into viral proteins by the host cell is always denoted the positive (+) sense strand, and the template strand from which it is copied is denoted as the negative (-) sense strand.
