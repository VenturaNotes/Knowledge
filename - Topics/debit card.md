- A plastic card issued by a bank or building society to enable its customers to pay for goods or services at certain retail outlets by using the telephone network to debit their accounts directly. It is also known as a payment card. The retail outlets need to have a computerized input device, into which the card is inserted; the customer is usually required to tap in a personal identification number. Most debit cards also function as cash cards and cheque cards. In the USA these cards are sometimes called asset cards.
