- $n$. The eccentric (1) localization of a sensation at the position in space of the stimulus object rather than at the point where the sense organ is stimulated, so that the greenness of a leaf is perceived as being on the tree rather than on the retina. Visual sensations are projected eccentrically in most cases, but touch sensations are projected only with haptic touch when objects are held in the hand, smells have indefinite spatial location, and eccentric projection is not possible for tastes. Also called extradition.
