- Digital Audio Broadcasting Plus (DAB+) is an upgraded version of DAB radio. It supports new and more efficient codecs, i.e., devices that compress and decompress digital media files, and provides a better error connection. Traditional DAB signals use an MPEG audio file format called MP2 for encryption. However, DAB+ signals use AAC+ encoding, making audio sound better at a lower bit rate. DAB+ also has a more advanced reception quality, larger bandwidth scope, and incorporates more data formats so listeners can find out information such as song titles and program names. Listeners who have a DAB radio cannot listen to DAB+ stations.
