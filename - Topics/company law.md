- The law relating to the formation and operation of companies. Laws are necessary for the existence of companies, which are artificial persons whose rights and obligations exist only in a legal framework provided by the state. Company law lays down the rights and duties of directors and shareholders, and determines the extent of limited liability for a company's debts, and the amount of information a company is obliged to provide for its shareholders, the Registrar of Companies, and the tax authorities.
