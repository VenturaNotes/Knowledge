- A defined benefit plan is a type of retirement or pension plan arranged and managed by the employer. Upon retirement, employees get regular payments to support their cost of living; they may also opt for a lump-sum payout. Some defined benefit plans allow spouses to pool their pension funds. Employers can often claim tax deductions on this type of pension plan. Businesses of all sizes, even small startups, can set up defined benefit plans for their employees.
