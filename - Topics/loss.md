- The result of a business operation where expenditures exceed receipts. Business losses may arise internally, through failure to produce enough of anything the market will buy to cover production expenses, or externally, through failure of others to pay bills due, or to repay debts. The effect of losses is to reduce a business's capital. If losses proceed so far that the total assets of a business become less than its liabilities, the business becomes insolvent, and should be either closed or rescued by a fresh injection of capital. See also CAPITAL LOSS; DEADWEIGHT LOSS; TRIANGLE OF LOSS.

- $n$. no longer having some valued aspect of one's life, such as a relationship, a job, or a home, that one has previously enjoyed. This may have health consequences: shock, disbelief, and emotional numbness may be followed by anger, guilt, anxiety, or profound sadness. Such emotions may lead to behavioral changes or symptoms that bring people to health care. Encouraging the patient to talk about the loss will require empathy, sensitivity, and judgment from the professional, both to obtain the history of the events and to provide helpful advice and direction to assist in adjustment. See also BEREAVEMENT.
