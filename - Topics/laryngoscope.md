- $n$. a device used to inspect the larynx. This can be for diagnostic purposes, to facilitate surgery on the laryngeal structures, or to aid insertion of an endotracheal tube (see intubation). Diagnostic laryngoscopes for use on awake patients are generally fibreoptic devices that are introduced through the mouth or nose. Surgical laryngoscopes are hollow tubes that are passed through the mouth and pharynx and are often used in conjunction with an operating microscope. Intubating or anaesthetic laryngoscopes consist of a handle and a curved blade, fitted with a light, for moving the tongue and epiglottis aside.
