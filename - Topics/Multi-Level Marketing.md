- Multi-level marketing (MLM) is a business strategy used by direct sales companies. MLMs encourage existing members to sell their offerings in addition to recruiting others to join the business. This type of business strategy is also commonly referred to as network marketing. The structure of MLMs is made up of a hierarchy of roles that can be ascended through either sales success or successful recruiting practices. MLM participants are often paid a percentage of their own sales and their recruits' sales, meaning that the more layers of recruits there are, the more money the business ªs salespeople can earn.
