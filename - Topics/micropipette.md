- $n$. an extremely fine tube from which minute volumes of liquid can be delivered. It can also be used to draw up minute quantities of liquid for examination. Using a micropipette it is possible to add or take away material from individual cells under the microscope.
## Source[^2]
- A glass pipette with an ultrafine tip, typically less than $1 ~\mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter. It can be inserted into single cells or other microscopic structures and used, for example, to inject materials (see MICROINJECTION). The micropipette is usually held by a micromanipulator, a mechanical device that allows precise movement of the tip. See also MICROELECTRODE.
