- (in statistics) a test to determine if the difference between two groups of observations is statistically significant (see SIGNIFICANCE), used in controlled trials and other studies. It measures the differences between theoretical and observed values and identifies whether or not variables are related.

- $n$. In statistics, a test based on the chi-square distribution to test for a possible association between two variables measured on nominal scales (called the chi-square test of association) or to determine the goodness of fit (1) of observed frequencies to a theoretical frequency distribution (called the chi-square goodness of fit test), the same formula being used for both types of test. In both cases, researchers most commonly use the Pearson chi-square test, the formula for calculating the test statistic being $\chi^{2}=\Sigma(O-E)^{2} / E$, where $O$ represents an observed frequency, $E$ an expected frequency under the null hypothesis, and the summation is over all pairs of observed and expected frequencies. The main alternative is the likelihood ratio chi-square test. See also NON-PARAMETRIC STATISTICS. Compare LOG-LINEAR ANALYSIS. Symbol: $\chi^{2}$.
