- $n$. a drug that enhances the expulsion of sputum from the air passages. Mucolytic expectorants act by decreasing the viscosity of the bronchial secretions so that they are easier to cough up. Drugs such as ipecacuanha and ammonium chloride are claimed to be stimulant expectorants in small quantities: they irritate the lining of the stomach, which is said to provide a stimulus for the reflex production of sputum by the glands in the bronchial mucous membrane. At higher doses they produce vomiting.
