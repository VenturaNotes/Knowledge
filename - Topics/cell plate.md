- The structure that forms in a dividing plant cell at the end of mitosis; it separates the cytoplasm of the two daughter protoplasts. The cell plate is formed from vesicles made by dictyosomes and arranged by the microtubules of the phragmoplast in the equatorial region of the spindle. These vesicles contain pectin, cellulose, and hemicellulose, which contribute to the middle lamella and the primary wall of the new cell wall. The cell plate eventually fuses with the cell wall of the parent cell, dividing it into two daughter cells.
