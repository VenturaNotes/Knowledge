- An employee resource group (ERG) is an employee-led initiative within an organization. It is voluntary and driven by an aspect unique to the group of employees. This aspect may include common interests, backgrounds, and social initiatives. ERGs are supported in many ways by the parent company. Still, they are not directly affiliated with or supervised by the company. Instead, they are driven by employees.
