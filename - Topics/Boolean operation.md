- (logical operation) An operation on Boolean values, producing a Boolean result (see also Boolean algebra). The operations may be monadic or dyadic, and are denoted by symbols known as Boolean operators. In general there are 16 Boolean operations over one or two operands; they include AND, OR, NOT, NAND, NOR, exclusive-OR, and equivalence. Boolean operations involving more than two operands can always be expressed in terms of operations involving one or two operands.
- In constructive solid geometry, Boolean operations are the three set operations union, set difference, and intersection.
