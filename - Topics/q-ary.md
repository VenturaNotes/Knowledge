- ($q$-valued) Having $q$ values, where $q$ is a positive integer not less than 2. In logic circuits, the treatment of $q$ values is called multivalued logic, or binary logic for $q=2$. In coding theory, some codes are restricted to the binary case; others can operate with arbitrary $q$ or with $q$ a prime number. Throughout switching and coding theory, the binary case is by far the most important. See also POLYNOMIAL.
