- $n$. a specialized sensory nerve ending (see RECEPTOR) that monitors internal changes in the body brought about by movement and muscular activity. Proprioceptors located in muscles and tendons transmit information that is used to coordinate muscular activity (see STRETCH RECEPTOR; TENDON ORGAN). See also MECHANORECEPTOR.

- Any receptor that is sensitive to movement, pressure, or stretching within the body. Proprioceptors occurring in muscles, tendons, and ligaments are important for the coordination of muscular activity and the maintenance of balance and posture. See MECHANORECEPTOR; STRETCH RECEPTOR.
