### Definition
- The transpose of a matrix is when the rows become columns and the columns become the rows
	- Given A = $\begin{bmatrix}2 & 1 \\ 3 & 5\end{bmatrix}$, $A^{T}$ = $\begin{bmatrix}2 & 3 \\ 1 & 5\end{bmatrix}$
### Rules
- Given A is a matrix
	- $|A| = |A^{T}|$
		- The determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of the transpose of that matrix

## Source[^2]
- (of an $m \times n$ matrix $A$ ) The $n \times m$ matrix, symbol $A^{\mathrm{T}}$, given by interchanging rows and columns. Thus the $i, j$th element of $A^{\mathrm{T}}$ is equal to the $j$, $i$th element of $A$.
