### Definition
- The transpose of a matrix is when the rows become columns and the columns become the rows
	- Given A = $\begin{bmatrix}2 & 1 \\ 3 & 5\end{bmatrix}$, $A^{T}$ = $\begin{bmatrix}2 & 3 \\ 1 & 5\end{bmatrix}$
### Rules
- Given A is a matrix
	- $|A| = |A^{T}|$
		- The determinant of a matrix is equal to the determinant of the transpose of that matrix
