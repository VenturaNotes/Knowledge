- The amount by which the cost of a service or product has been increased to arrive at the selling price. It is calculated by expressing the profit as a percentage of the cost of the good or service. For example, if a product cost $\textsterling8$ and is sold for $\textsterling 12$, the mark-up would be: $$\textsterling 4/\textsterling 8 \times 100 = 50\%.$$Note that the margin is calculated by expressing the profit as a percentage of the selling price; in this case it would be:$$\textsterling4/\textsterling12 \times 100 = 33.3\%$$The mark-up is widely used in retailing, both for setting prices and as a ratio for control and decision making. See gross profit percentage; net profit percentage

- The excess of the selling price of a product over the cost of making or buying it. The mark-up on any product has to cover the overhead costs of the firm, as well as provide a profit margin.
