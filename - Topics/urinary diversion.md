- any of various techniques for the collection and diversion of urine away from its usual excretory channels, after the bladder has been removed (see CYSTECTOMY) or bypassed. These techniques include ureterosigmoidostomy and the construction of an ileal conduit. Continent diversion, usually after cystectomy, may be achieved by constructing a reservoir or pouch from a section of small or large intestine or a combination of both. This can be emptied by catheterization via a small stoma and has the advantage over an ileal conduit in not requiring a urinary drainage bag.
