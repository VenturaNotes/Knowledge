- A type of hybrid cell that is produced by the fusion of a tumor cell (a myeloma cell) with a normal antibody-producing B cell (see CELL FUSION). The resulting hybrid cell line is able to produce large amounts of normal antibody, which is described as monoclonal (see MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY) as it results from a cloned cell line.
