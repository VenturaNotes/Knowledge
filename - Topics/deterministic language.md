- Any context-free language recognized by a deterministic pushdown automaton. An example of a simple nondeterministic language is the set of all palindromes over an alphabet with two or more letters. A language is deterministic if and only if it is $\operatorname{LR}(k)$ for some $k$ (see LR PARSING).
