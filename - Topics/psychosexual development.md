- the process by which an individual becomes more mature in his or her sexual feelings and behavior. Gender identity, sex-role behavior, and choice of sexual partner are the three major areas of development. In Freudian psychoanalysis the phrase is sometimes used specifically for a sequence of stages, supposed by psychoanalytic psychologists to be universal, in which oral, anal, phallic, latency, and genital stages successively occur. These stages reflect the parts of the body on which sexual interest is concentrated during childhood development.
