- A control code that is used in the formatting of printed or displayed output. It indicates that the next data character is to appear in the leftmost position on a line. In some serial printers, the CR code may cause a physical movement of the printing carriage to the leftmost print position. In other types of printer the characters will be correctly positioned on the line although they may be printed in some other sequence or even simultaneously. Some operating systems use CR to terminate a line of input and often an implied line feed is added.
