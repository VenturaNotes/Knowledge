- a hereditary condition in which the corneal endothelium loses its functional ability, usually with age. It may result in thickening and swelling of the cornea (bullous keratopathy) and thus affect vision. Cornea guttata, small whitish deposits of hyalin, are seen on the inner surface of the cornea and signify a reduced number of endothelial cells. A corneal transplantation (see KERATOPLASTY) may become necessary in certain cases. \[E. Fuchs (1851-1913), German ophthalmologist]
