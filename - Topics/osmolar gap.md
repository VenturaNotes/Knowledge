- the difference between the measured serum osmolality and the calculated osmolality using the following formula:
	$$\text{calculated osmolality} =2\left[\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right.(\text{in}~ mmol / l) + \text{glucose}(\text{in}~ mmol / l) + \text{urea}(\text{in}~ mmol / l)]$$
- It is an aid to the diagnosis of severe anion gap acidoses. The normal range for the difference is $\pm ~10~ \mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{kg}$. A high osmolar gap is normally due to the presence of acetone, mannitol, or an alcohol.
