- (COM) A system that produces computer output on microfilm or microfiche. The information is recorded on film either by a camera that photographs a miniature screen displaying the computer output, or by a laser beam recorder, which writes directly onto the film. COM is used where there is a large volume of output, particularly where immediate reference is not required.
