## Synthesis
- Refers to the specific arrangement of layers, patterns, and interconnections that constitute an integrated circuit, embodying the design of the circuit. 
- Semiconductor topography rights protect the original layout design itself, rather than the underlying ideas or processes, preventing unauthorized reproduction, importation, or distribution of the topography or products incorporating it. The protection is typically granted for a limited period, often 10 years, and aims to incentivize innovation in microchip design.
