- (columnar-lined oesophagus) a condition in which the squamous epithelium lining the oesophagus is replaced by columnar epithelium of the type normally lining the intestine ('intestinal metaplasia'). Barrett's oesophagus is caused by chronic inflammation and damage resulting from gastro-oesophageal reflux or (less frequently) corrosive oesophagitis. The appearance of Barrett's epithelium seen at endoscopy must be confirmed by biopsy. Patients with confirmed Barrett's oesophagus are at a higher risk of developing oesophageal adenocarcinoma and may be kept under surveillance with regular endoscopies. \[N. R. Barrett (1903-79), British thoracic surgeon]
