- (WHO) an international organization working to improve global public health. Membership is open to all countries, and the member states are divided into six regions; the United Kingdom is part of the WHO European Region. Health issues are discussed and policies evolved mainly through topic-specific working groups. WHO staff are seconded by invitation to advise countries on solving public health problems (especially infectious disease control). WHO handles information on the internationally notifiable diseases, publishes the International Classification of Diseases, and awards fellowships to enable health staff from poorer countries to obtain further training.
