## Source[^2]
- $n$. A technique of counselling or psychotherapy developed by the US psychologist Carl Rogers (1902-87) from the 1940s onwards, in which therapists or counsellors deliberately refrain from interpreting what their clients say but try instead to convey an attitude of unconditional positive regard in the context of a permissive, accepting, nonthreatening relationship, and to help by clarifying, rephrasing, and reflecting back the feelings or emotions that lie behind the clients' words and behavior, the assumption being that people are capable of identifying the sources of their own emotional problems and of working out solutions for themselves once they are freed from feelings of anxiety and insecurity. US client-centered therapy. Also called client-centred counselling, person-centred therapy or counselling, non-directive therapy or counselling.
