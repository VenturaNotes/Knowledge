- Long-lived goods bought for final consumption. Their services are expected to be enjoyed over a period longer than that (usually a year) used in national income accounting. Examples are private cars, boats, and domestic items such as furniture and appliances. Footwear and clothing are not normally treated as consumer durables, although they are frequently made to last for several years. House purchase is normally treated as an investment and not as spending on a consumer durable.
