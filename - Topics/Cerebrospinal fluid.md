## Source [^1]
- (CSF) the clear watery fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It is contained in the subarachnoid space and circulates in the ventricles of the brain and in the central canal of the spinal cord. The brain floats in the fluid (its weight so being reduced from about 1400g to less than 100 g ) and is cushioned by it from contact with the skull when the head is moved vigorously. The CSF is secreted by the choroid plexuses in the ventricles, circulates through them to reach the subarachnoid space, and is eventually absorbed into the bloodstream through the arachnoid villi. Its normal contents are glucose, salts, enzymes, and a few white cells, but no red blood cells. See Appendix 5.
## Source[^2]
- (CSF) The fluid, similar in composition to lymph, that bathes the central nervous system of vertebrates. It is secreted by the choroid plexus into the ventricles of the brain, filling these and other cavities in the brain and spinal cord, and is reabsorbed by veins on the brain surface. Its function is to protect the central nervous system from mechanical injury, to supply it with nutrients and hormones, and to remove wastes.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The clear colorless fluid that fills the subarachnoid space, thereby immersing the entire central nervous system, and that circulates through the ventricles of the brain, within which it is secreted, before flowing passively into the venous bloodstream, the total volume of fluid (about 150 millilitres) being replaced in an adult human being every three or four hours. Also called neurolymph. See also CHOROID PLEXUS, EPENDYMA, EPENDYMAL CELL, HYDROCEPHALUS. CSF abbrev.
