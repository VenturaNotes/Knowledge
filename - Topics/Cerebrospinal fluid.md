- (CSF) the clear watery fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It is contained in the subarachnoid space and circulates in the ventricles of the brain and in the central canal of the spinal cord. The brain floats in the fluid (its weight so being reduced from about 1400g to less than 100 g ) and is cushioned by it from contact with the skull when the head is moved vigorously. The CSF is secreted by the choroid plexuses in the ventricles, circulates through them to reach the subarachnoid space, and is eventually absorbed into the bloodstream through the arachnoid villi. Its normal contents are glucose, salts, enzymes, and a few white cells, but no red blood cells. See Appendix 5.
