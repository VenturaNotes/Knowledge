- (RESET) A general specification test for a linear regression model. It tests whether non-linear combinations of explanatory variables, in particular, their powers, help explain the dependent variable. The test is performed by regressing the predicted value of the dependent variable, $\hat{y}$, on the explanatory variables as well as the powers of $\hat{y}$, and then testing the joint significance of the coefficients on the latter. If these are significant, the linear model is misspecified.
