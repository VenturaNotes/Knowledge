- A Secure Web Gateway (SWG) is a type of security that prevents unwanted website traffic from attacking an organization's network. This traffic includes malware, trojans, and viruses.
- An SWG is a barrier between the organization's network and the internet. It detects and filters unwanted content from users. SWGs usually include URL filtering, malicious-code detection, malicious-code filtering, as well as application controls for social media, instant messaging, and video conferencing.
- More advanced SWGs might include functionality to prevent data leaks. Or they might include the ability to block sensitive data, such as intellectual property, from leaving an organization's network. This process is called exfiltration.
