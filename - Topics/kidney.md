- $n$. either of the pair of organs responsible for the excretion of nitrogenous wastes, principally urea, from the blood (see illustrations). The kidneys are situated at the back of the abdomen, below the diaphragm, one on each side of the spine; they are supplied with blood by the renal arteries. Each kidney is enclosed in a fibrous capsule and is composed of an outer cortex and an inner medulla. The active units of the kidney are the nephrons, within the cortex and medulla, which filter the blood under pressure and then reabsorb water and selected substances back into the blood. The urine thus formed is conducted from the nephrons via the renal tubules into the renal pelvis and from here to the ureter, which leads to the bladder. See also HAEMODIALYSIS; HORSESHOE KIDNEY; RENAL FUNCTION TESTS.

- The main organ of excretion and osmoregulation in vertebrates, through which nitrogenous waste material (usually in the form of urine) and surplus water, ions, etc., are eliminated from the body. In mammals there is a pair of kidneys situated in the abdomen (see illustration). Each has an outer cortex and an inner medulla and is made up of tubular units called nephrons, through which nitrogenous waste is filtered from the blood, with the formation of urine. The nephrons drain into a basin-like cavity in the kidney (the renal pelvis), which leads to the ureter and bladder.
