- A business strategy in which decisions are made in response to events as they occur, rather than according to a preconceived plan. The term was introduced by the academic Henry Mintzberg in 1978. Mintzberg defines an emergent strategy as one in which either (i) no plan was formulated at the outset or (ii) the initial strategy was displaced along the way. Compare DELIBERATE STRATEGY; PRESCRIPTIVE STRATEGY.
