- Softswitches are part of telecommunications networks and connect telephone calls without a physical switch. To do so, they connect to a server that runs an application and a media gateway that link to an IP, a PSTN, or an ATM network. This technology can support multiple telecommunications protocols, transfer calls to another network element, and generate intelligence that controls connections for a native IP endpoint or media gateway. A softswitch is also known as a call server, a call agent, or an MGC. In a mobile network, it is known as a mobile switching center (MSC).
