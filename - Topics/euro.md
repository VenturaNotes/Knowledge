- The currency unit of the European Union's eurozone, divided into 100 cents. In January 1999 it was adopted for all purposes except cash transactions by Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain; Greece followed suit in 2001. Euro-denominated notes and coins were issued in January 2002 and the national currencies were withdrawn after a short period of dual circulation. Slovenia adopted the euro in 2007, as did Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, and Lithuania in 2015. Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City also use the euro through agreements with the EU; Kosovo and Montenegro likewise use the euro but without any such agreement. The euro is also used in the Azores, the Canary Islands, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Madeira, Martinique, Mayotte, Réunion, Saint-Barthélemy, and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. See European Economic and Monetary Union.
