- The transformation of a detailed design into a program. Use of the term coding generally implies a straightforward activity-simply expressing an existing design in some formal programming language-and that any decisions made during the activity (such as the choice among arbitrary locations for particular variables) would not be classed as design decisions since they are of a relatively trivial nature. See also SOFTWARE LIFE CYCLE.
