- The mechanism postulated by the French biologists Fran√ßois Jacob (1920-2013) and J. Monod (1910-76) in 1961 to explain the control of gene expression in bacteria (see OPERON). Jacob and Monod investigated the expression of the gene that codes for the enzyme $\beta$-galactosidase, which breaks down lactose; the operon that regulates lactose metabolism is called the lac operon.
