- $n$. the endoscopic or surgical removal of a polyp. The technique used depends upon the site and size of the polyp. Endoscopically, polyps can be removed by various methods. A hot biopsy involves coagulation of a small polyp using a diathermy current passed through biopsy forceps, which obtains a sample for analysis at the same time. Cold biopsy involves removal of a polyp using forceps alone, thereby decreasing the perforation risk. Snare polypectomy uses a wire loop (snare) to cut through the base of the polyp. This is performed with or without a diathermy current (hot snare vs. cold snare); the current reduces the risk of bleeding by coagulating local blood vessels as the snare cuts through the polyp. Endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) involves lifting a flat polyp by injecting a hypertonic solution into the submucosa beneath the polyp followed by snare polypectomy with diathermy. Nasal polyps may be removed using endoscopic sinus surgery techniques, sometimes utilizing a microdebrider.
