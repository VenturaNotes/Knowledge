- The cost to a firm of revising prices. The term arose out of the literal idea of updating menus, price lists, and any other promotional materials. It is now used to refer to any transaction costs that a firm faces when changing prices. Menu costs are an explanation for price stickiness: the reluctance of firms to change prices in response to minor fluctuations in the economic environment.

- The costs incurred by a firm when it changes its prices. The term alludes to the case of a restaurant, which is obliged to reprint its menus every time it changes a price; this means that it will only make such changes when the costs of not doing so clearly outweigh the cost and inconvenience of reprinting. Menu costs are frequently cited as one explanation for the stickiness of prices, i.e. their failure to respond immediately to shifts in supply and demand. Some analysts have argued that e-commerce will eradicate most traditional forms of menu costs.
