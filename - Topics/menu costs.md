- The cost to a firm of revising prices. The term arose out of the literal idea of updating menus, price lists, and any other promotional materials. It is now used to refer to any transaction costs that a firm faces when changing prices. Menu costs are an explanation for price stickiness: the reluctance of firms to change prices in response to minor fluctuations in the economic environment.
