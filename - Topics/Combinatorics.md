- The branch of mathematics concerned with the counting problems and enumeration problems associated with such topics as combinations, permutations, number theory, arithmetic, and the theory of graphs, groups, and other discrete structures. Induction, recursion, and recurrence relations tend to play a significant role in much of this work. In computational combinatorics the underlying theory is applied to algorithms of any kind.
