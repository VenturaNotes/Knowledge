- A graphical representation of inequality. Personal incomes in a country, for example, are arranged in ascending order: the cumulative share of total income is then plotted against the cumulative share of the population. The slope of this curve is thus proportional to per capita income at each point of the population distribution. For complete equality of income the Lorenz curve would be a straight line; it becomes more curved as inequality rises. Assume the Lorenz curves for two income distributions with the same mean income have been plotted. If the two Lorenz curves do not cross, the curve closest to being a straight line represents the income distribution with lower inequality. If the two Lorenz curves cross, no unambiguous ranking of the inequality of the two income distributions can be given. The Gini coefficient is equal to half the area between the Lorenz curve for an income distribution and the straight-line Lorenz curve representing the absence of inequality.
