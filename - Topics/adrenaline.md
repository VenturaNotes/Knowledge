- (epinephrine) A hormone (see formula), produced by the medulla of the adrenal glands, that increases heart rate and blood pressure, improves the power and prolongs the action of muscles, and increases the rate and depth of breathing to prepare the body for 'fright, flight, or fight' (see ALARM RESPONSE). At the same time it inhibits digestion and excretion and stimulates the mobilization of body fat (lipolysis) and glycogen stored in the liver, hence increasing the concentration of glucose in the blood for energy metabolism (glycolysis). Similar effects are produced by stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. Adrenaline causes these effects by binding to adrenoceptors on target cells. It can be administered by injection to relieve bronchial asthma and reduce blood loss during surgery by constricting blood vessels. See ADRENOCEPTOR.

## Source[^2]
- (epinephrine) $n$. an important hormone secreted by the medulla of the adrenal gland. It has the function of preparing the body for 'fright, flight, or fight' and has widespread effects on circulation, the muscles, and sugar metabolism. The action of the heart is increased, the rate and depth of breathing are increased, and the metabolic rate is raised; the force of muscular contraction improves and the onset of muscular fatigue is delayed. At the same time the blood supply to the bladder and intestines is reduced, their muscular walls relax, and the sphincters contract. Sympathetic nerves were originally thought to act by releasing adrenaline at their endings, and were therefore called adrenergic nerves. In fact the main substance released is the related substance noradrenaline, which also forms a portion of the adrenal secretion.
- Adrenaline given by injection is used in the emergency treatment of anaphylaxis and cardiac arrest. It is also included in some local anaesthetic solutions, particularly those used in dentistry, to prolong anaesthesia, and is used as eye drops for treating glaucoma.
