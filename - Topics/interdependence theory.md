- $n$. A theory that seeks to analyze the causal determinants of dyadic social behavior by providing a systematic classification of certain key properties of interpersonal situations or interactions and of the individuals' responses to them. It was first proposed by the US social psychologists Harold H(arding) Kelley (1921-2003) and John W(alter) Thibaut (1917-86) in their book The Social Psychology of Groups (1959) and developed in Interpersonal Relations: A Theory of Interdependence (1978), and Kelley extended it further in an article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 1984. In the theory, the nature of the interdependence between two individuals depends on the manner in which each can influence what happens to the other during the course of the social interaction, and this is called 'outcome interdependence'. See behaviour CONTROL, fate CONTROL. IT abbrev. \[From Latin inter between + dependere to hang from, from de from + pendere to hang + entia indicating an action, state, condition, or quality]
