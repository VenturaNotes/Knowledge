## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Any way of thinking that attempts to understand how interactions between elements of a complex system can influence the functioning of the system as a whole and vice versa. Problem solving within such a context will involve a detailed analysis of the relationship between the parts and the whole rather than a simple focus on the part or parts in question. The systems-thinking approach can be applied to virtually any system, whether this is a computer network, a business, or a complex society. It has therefore proved influential in disciplines ranging from organizational design to town planning and ecology.
