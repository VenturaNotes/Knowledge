- a powerful nerve toxin, produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, that has proved effective, in minute dosage, for the treatment of various conditions of muscle dysfunction, such as dystonic conditions (see DYSTONIA), including torticollis and spasm of the orbicularis muscle in patients with blepharospasm, and spastic paralysis associated with cerebral palsy and stroke. It is also used for the treatment of severe hyperhidrosis and the prevention of chronic migraine headaches. The toxin may also be used to treat achalasia, being injected through an endoscope into the gastro-oesophageal sphincter, and is used in the bladder to treat urinary incontinence due to detrusor overactivity (as in multiple sclerosis) that is resistant to other treatments. Side-effects include prolonged local muscle paralysis. Under the trade names Botox and Dysport it is widely used for the cosmetic treatment of facial wrinkles.
