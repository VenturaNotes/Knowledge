- Literally, assets that can be touched, i.e. physical objects such as land, buildings, or machinery. However, tangible assets may also include leases and company shares. They are therefore best defined as the fixed assets of an organization excluding such intangible assets as goodwill, patents, and trademarks, which are even more intangible than leases and shares.

- Assets that can be physically touched. This should literally include only physical objects like plant and equipment, but it is often also used to include leases and company shares, as these are mainly titles to tangible assets. See also INTANGIBLE ASSETS.
