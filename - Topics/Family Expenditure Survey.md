- (FES) A continuous survey of household expenditure and income in the UK that ran from 1957 to March 2001. From 2001 to 2008 the data continued to be collected in the Expenditure and Food Survey, formed by combining the FES with the National Food Survey. This was then replaced by the Living Costs and Food Survey.
