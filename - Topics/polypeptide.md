## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. a molecule consisting of three or more amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. Protein molecules are polypeptides.
## Source[^2]
- A peptide comprising 20 or more amino acids. Polypeptides that constitute proteins may contain up to 1000 amino acids, typically 100 to 300 . Shorter ones include certain antibiotics, e.g. gramicidin, and some hormones, e.g. ACTH, which has 39 amino acids. The properties of a polypeptide are determined by the type, sequence, and threedimensional arrangement of its constituent amino acids. One end, the C terminus, has a free carboxyl group, while the other end has a free amino group, the N terminus. See PROTEIN.
