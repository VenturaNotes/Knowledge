## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. a molecule consisting of three or more amino acids linked together by peptide bonds. Protein molecules are polypeptides.
## Source[^2]
- A peptide comprising 20 or more amino acids. Polypeptides that constitute proteins may contain up to 1000 amino acids, typically 100 to 300 . Shorter ones include certain antibiotics, e.g. gramicidin, and some hormones, e.g. ACTH, which has 39 amino acids. The properties of a polypeptide are determined by the type, sequence, and threedimensional arrangement of its constituent amino acids. One end, the C terminus, has a free carboxyl group, while the other end has a free amino group, the N terminus. See PROTEIN.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A molecule that is smaller than a protein, consisting of a peptide chain composed of amino acids linked together. If the molecular weight (in units of the weight of a single hydrogen atom) is less than 10,000, corresponding to about 100 amino acids, it is arbitrarily called a polypeptide; if the molecular weight exceeds 10,000 , corresponding to over 100 amino acids, it is called a protein. The basis for the dividing line is the fact that molecules lighter than 10,000, when in solution, will pass through cellophane, providing a simple discriminative test. \[From Greek polys many + English peptide]
## Source[^4]
- A peptide comprising ten or more amino acids. Polypeptides that constitute proteins usually contain 100-300 amino acids. Shorter ones include certain antibiotics, e.g. gramicidin, and some hormones, e.g. ACTH, which has 39 amino acids. The properties of a polypeptide are determined by the type and sequence of its constituent amino acids.
