- $n$. Any of a number of disorders of the nervous system, all fatal, believed to be caused by rogue prions, including scrapie in sheep, BSE in cattle, and the human prion diseases new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (nvCJD), fatal familial insomnia (FFI), Gerstmann-Sträussler-Scheinker syndrome (GSS), and kuru. Unlike all other infectious diseases they do not provoke immune responses, and they are therefore difficult to detect because tests based on antibody production cannot be developed.
