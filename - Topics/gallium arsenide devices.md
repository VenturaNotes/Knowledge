- (GaAs devices) Semiconductor integrated-circuit devices that are implemented using gallium arsenide as the intrinsic semiconductor material in preference to, say, silicon. Gallium arsenide has certain advantages over other semiconductor materials, in particular in high-speed applications and in the fabrication of optical and optically coupled devices such as light-emitting diodes and optoisolators.
