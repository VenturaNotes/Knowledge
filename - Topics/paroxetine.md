It is taken by mouth for the treatment of depression, obsessivecompulsive disorder, panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and some other anxiety disorders; side-effects may include nausea, indigestion, abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and rash. Because of its short half-life paroxetine is often associated with discontinuation syndrome upon stopping.
