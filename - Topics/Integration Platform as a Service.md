- Integration platform as a service, or iPaas, is a cloud delivery model that integrates applications in different environments. It enables the development, governance, and execution of integration flows between internal systems and third-party service providers. iPaaS does this by combining on-premise and cloud-based technologies, data, and services across multiple organizations. Therefore, businesses can improve data security, compliance, productivity, teamwork, and workflows. Another benefit of iPaaS is enhanced data analytics. After integrating applications into a centralized cloud environment, enterprises can run data through business intelligence (BI) tools. They can also generate real-time metrics. These processes increase visibility among teams and provide managers with intelligence into organizational workflows.
