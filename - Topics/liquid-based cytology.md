- (LBC) a technique used for analysing cervical smears taken for cervical screening. The specimen is collected using a brush or spatula and then mixed with a liquid preservative fluid. In the laboratory, this fluid is spun and filtered to remove blood and other extraneous material, leaving a thin layer of cells that is spread on a microscope slide and examined. LBC yields specimens that are easier to screen and give more accurate results than those obtained by the traditional Pap test.
