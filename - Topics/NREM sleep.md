- abbrev. Non-rapid-eye-movement sleep, in which four progressively deepening stages can be distinguished by EEG measurements: Stage I NREM sleep, without delta waves, is the stage of transition between wakefulness and sleep, and it occupies about 5 per cent of sleeping time in healthy adults; Stage II NREM sleep, with delta waves 20 per cent of the time, is characterized by sleep spindles and K complexes, and it occupies about 50 per cent of normal adult sleeping time; and Stages III and IV NREM sleep, or slow-wave sleep, with delta waves more than 50 per cent of the time, are the deepest levels, and they occupy about 10-20 per cent of normal adult sleeping time. Also called quiet sleep or synchronized (S) sleep. See also sleep. Compare REM sleep.
