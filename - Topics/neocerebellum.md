- $n$. the middle lobe of the cerebellum, excluding the pyramid and uvula. In evolutionary terms it is the newest part, occurring only in mammals.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. The most recently evolved functional part of the cerebellum, comprising the lateral areas of the cerebellar hemispheres, receiving inputs from the pons and projecting to the motor cortex also via the pons. Lesions in this area lead to ipsilateral (same side of the body) incoordination of movements, especially in the upper limbs, adiadochokinesia, intention tremor, and dysarthria. See also cerebellar SYndROME. Compare SPINOCEREBELLUM, VESTIBULOCEREBELLUM. \[From Greek neos new + Latin cerebellum a little brain, diminutive of cerebrum a brain]
