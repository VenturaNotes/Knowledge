- A model that has been widely used in business and other organizations to understand group development and the way in which individuals learn to function as a team. The theory, which was first defined by George O. Charrier at Procter \& Gamble in 1972, sets out five stages of teamwork: (i) the 'polite' stage, in which the group members are introduced to one another; (ii) the 'why we're here' stage, which establishes initial goals and relationships; (iii) the 'power' stage, which is characterized by competition between group members; (iv) the 'cooperation' stage, where greater teamwork emerges; and finally (v) the 'esprit' stage, where the team is cohesive and successful.
