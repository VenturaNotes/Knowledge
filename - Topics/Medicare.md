- in the USA, a national programme of health insurance for persons who are 65 and older or disabled or who have permanent kidney failure. The programme consists of three parts: hospital insurance provides coverage for inpatient hospital services, skilled nursing facilities, home health services, and hospice care; medical insurance helps pay for physician services, outpatient hospital services, medical equipment and supplies, and preventive services such as cancer screening tests; and prescription drug plans cover a range of medications depending on which plan is chosen. Medicare does not cover all expenses, and various supplemental insurance policies, managed care plans, and private fee-forservice plans are available that provide additional benefits.
