## Source [^1]
- A malaise that affects businesses after a severe cost-cutting phase. The firm's ability to expand production to maintain its competitive position in the market may, for example, be compromised by a misguided pressure to reduce costs by downsizing, resulting in the elimination of personnel who made a long-term contribution to the company's viability.
