- Knowledge capture is the process of recording and organizing inferred knowledge (i.e., information that has not been written down), so it can be used for later retrieval or analysis. This can be done in several ways, such as through knowledge management systems or simply by documenting or recording data and organizing it into categories based on relevance and importance.
