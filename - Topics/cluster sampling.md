- A method of selecting a sample in which the members of the sample are chosen from one or more groups (clusters), rather than from the population as a whole. This technique is often used when random sampling from the whole population would be impractical or expensive. In auditing, for example, groups of, say, invoices are chosen at random by the auditor and then each item in each group is examined in detail. In marketing research, clusters of respondents are often chosen according to their geographical areas in order to reduce travelling costs. See also SYSTEMATIC SAMPLING.
