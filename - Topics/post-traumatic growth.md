- $n$. Improvement in psychological functioning following a traumatic experience, especially in the areas of self-evaluation (increased self-confidence and acceptance of personal limitations), personal relationships (increased compassion, appreciation of intimacy, and appreciation of friendships), and personal philosophy (replacement of materialistic outlook with deeper understanding of what matters in life). It is summed up in the maxim published in 1889 by the German philosopher Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche (1844-1900): 'Aus der Kriegsschule des Lebens.$\textemdash$Was mich nicht umbringt, macht mich stärker' (From the military academy of life: What doesn't kill me makes me stronger). The concept was introduced by the US psychologist Richard G. Tedeschi (born 1950) and the Brazilian-born psychologist Lawrence G. Calhoun (born 1943) in an article in the Journal of Traumatic Stress in 1996 and is one of the central concepts in positive psychology. Compare POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER.
