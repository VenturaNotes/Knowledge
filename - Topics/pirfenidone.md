- $n$. a drug with antifibrotic and anti-inflammatory properties that is used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. It is thought to reduce fibroblast proliferation, inhibit transforming growth factor-$\beta$-stimulated collagen production, and reduce the production of fibrogenic mediators. Pirfenidone has also been shown to reduce production of inflammatory mediators, such as tumor necrosis factor and interleukin 1 (IL-1). Side effects include gastrointestinal upsets.
