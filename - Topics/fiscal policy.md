- The use of government spending and taxation to influence macroeconomic conditions. Fiscal policy was actively pursued to sustain full employment in the post-war years; however, monetarists and others have argued that this set off the inflation of the 1970s. Fiscal policy has remained generally 'tight' in most Western countries since the 1980s. Compare MONETARY POLICY.

- The use of taxation and government spending to influence the economy. This may work via changing tax rates or the rules about liability to tax, or via changes in government spending on real goods and services or transfer payments. Fiscal policy can be used both to influence the level of aggregate demand in the economy, and to change the incentives facing firms and individuals so as to encourage or discourage particular forms of activity. See also EASY FISCAL POLICY; TIGHT FISCAL POLICY.
