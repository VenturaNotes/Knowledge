- Automatic content recognition (ACR) is technology that can identify multimedia content (such as audio, video, and images) present within a file or on a device. ACR technology works by sampling a portion of the content and comparing that sample to a content repository to identify any matches via digital fingerprints or watermarks. Applications of this technology include video hosting platforms such as YouTube using ACR to identify and remove copyrighted material, while mobile apps such as Shazam use ACR to identify a song by processing a brief music sample.
