- $n$. In statistics, a distribution-free test of the significance of changes, especially applicable to before-after designs of the effects of particular treatments in which scores are dichotomous and measurement is made on a nominal scale or an ordinal scale. It tests the null hypothesis that unlike pairs of responses $(0,1)$ and $(1,0)$ are equally likely. \[Named after the US psychologist and statistician Quinn McNemar (1900-86) who developed it in 1947]
