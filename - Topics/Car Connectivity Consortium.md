- The car connectivity consortium (CCC) is a global association of automobile manufacturers, suppliers, and technology companies that develop standards for car communication systems.Â It includes specifications for how cars should communicate with other devices, including smartphones and navigation systems. The CCC aims to make it easier for automakers to build in-car systems that communicate with other devices. This will help improve the user experience and let drivers access traffic updates, fuel prices, and parking availability without fumbling through their smartphones. It would also enable features such as car-to-car communication and remote vehicle diagnostics.
