- (CAR) The total return available from an investment or deposit in which the interest is used to augment the investment. The more frequently the interest is credited, the higher the CAR.$$\begin{gathered}\text { CAR }=1+(\text {nominal rate } / \text { number of } \\\text { times interest paid per annum})\end{gathered}$$
- The CAR is usually quoted on a gross basis. The return, taking into account the deduction of tax at the basic rate on the interest, is known as the compound net annual rate (CNAR).
