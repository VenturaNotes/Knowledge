- n. 
- (1) An alteration in the form of a word through the influence of a more familiar word or words that people associate with it, as in sparrow-grass for asparagus. 
- (2) A popular misconception about the origin of a word. Thus belfry, the part of a tower in which bells are hung, comes from Medieval Latin berfredus a tower, not from the English word bell; crap, excrement or faeces, comes from Middle Dutch krappe chaff and is not named after Thomas Crapper (1836-1910), the Victorian English sanitary engineer who contributed to the development of the siphonic flush toilet and whose aptronym is inscribed on a manhole cover, popular with brass-rubbers, in the cloisters of Westminster Abbey; penthouse, a top-floor flat, comes via Middle English pentis from Latin appendicium an appendage, not from English pent or house; and pickaxe, a large double-pointed garden tool, comes from Old French picois a mattock, not from English pick or axe.
