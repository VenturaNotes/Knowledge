- Given a real function $f$, any function $\phi$ such that $\phi^{\prime}(x)=f(x)$, for all $x$ (in the domain of $f$ ), is an antiderivative of $f$. If $\phi_{1}$ and $\phi_{2}$ are both antiderivatives of a continuous function f , defined on an interval, then $\phi_{1}(x)$ and $\phi_{2}(x)$ differ by a constant. In that case, the notation$$\int f(x) \mathrm{d} x$$may be used for an antiderivative of $f$, with the understanding that an arbitrary constant can be added to any antiderivative. Thus,$$\int f(x) \mathrm{d} x+c$$where $c$ is an arbitrary constant, is an expression that gives all the antiderivatives of $f$.
