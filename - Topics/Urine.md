- $n$. the fluid excreted by the kidneys, which contains many of the body's waste products. It is the major route by which the end-products of nitrogen metabolism $\textendash$ urea, uric acid, and creatinine $\textendash$ are excreted. The other major constituent is sodium chloride. Over 100 other substances are usually present, but only in trace amounts. Analysis of urine (see URINALYSIS) is commonly used in the diagnosis of diseases (for example, there are high levels of urinary glucose in diabetes and of ketone bodies in ketonuria); immunological analysis of urine is the basis of most pregnancy tests. See Appendix 3.

- The aqueous fluid formed by the excretory organs of animals for the removal of metabolic waste products. In higher animals, urine is produced by the kidneys, stored in the bladder, and excreted through the urethra or cloaca. Apart from water, the major constituents of urine are one or more of the end products of nitrogen metabolism$\textemdash$ammonia, urea, uric acid, and creatinine. It may also contain various inorganic ions, the pigments urochrome and urobilin, amino acids, and purines. Precise composition depends on many factors, especially the habitat of a particular species: aquatic animals produce copious volumes; terrestrial animals need to conserve water and produce much less (about 1.0-1.5 litres per day in humans).
