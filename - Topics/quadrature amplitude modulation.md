- A system of modulation used in modems and communication channels that employs two carriers of identical frequency but with a 90 degree phase difference between them. Each carrier can be modulated independently. If the system allows, say, two levels for each carrier then this allows each signal element to represent one of 8 possible symbols, thus optimizing the available bandwidth usage.
