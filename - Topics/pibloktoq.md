- $n$. A culture-bound syndrome, sometimes called arctic hysteria in English, restricted mainly to Eskimo communities of North America and Greenland, characterized by a period of fatigue, social withdrawal, confusion, and irritability lasting for a few hours or days, leading up to an abrupt episode of dissociation that usually lasts only minutes, during which the afflicted person may strip or tear off clothes, roll in the snow, run about in a frenzied state, shout obscenities, destroy property, engage in other violent, dangerous, or antisocial forms of behavior, and manifest pseudolalia, echolalia, and echopraxia, before lapsing into convulsions and losing consciousness, followed typically by complete amnesia for the dissociative episode. \[From Inuit piblokto frenzy]
