- (column centimetres) A measurement of area of typeset matter equal to the width of a column of type in a newspaper or magazine multiplied by its depth. In practice, column centimetres have now largely replaced column inches, especially when it comes to selling advertisement space; however, most public relations consultancies still refer to column inches when measuring the coverage their activities have achieved.
