- A multiprocessor machine based on an array of cellular automata. Each automaton is usually a simple processor capable of simple computational tasks. In a normal architecture, each of these processing nodes can interchange data only with its immediate neighbors and all processing nodes carry out the same computational operation. Although the operations available at each node are quite simple, the aggregated effect of many such nodes can exhibit complex behavior and can rapidly model quite complex dynamic systems.
