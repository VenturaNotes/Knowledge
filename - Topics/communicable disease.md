- (contagious disease, infectious disease) any disease that can be transmitted from one person to another. This may occur by direct physical contact, by common handling of an object that has picked up infective microorganisms (see FOMES), through a disease carrier, or by spread of infected droplets coughed or exhaled into the air. The most dangerous communicable diseases are on the list of notifiable diseases. Specific legal obligations arise in respect of notifiable diseases by virtue of the Public Health (Control of Disease) Act 1984 (as amended), delegated legislation, and the Health and Social Care Act 2008.
