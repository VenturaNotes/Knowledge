- an airway tube with an elliptical inflatable cuff at one end for insertion into the mouth of a patient requiring artificial ventilation. It is designed to fit snugly in the patient's throat over the top of the laryngeal opening. While it is relatively easy to insert and allows delivery of effective artificial ventilation, it does not provide the absolute protection of the airway from vomitus afforded by an endotracheal tube (see INTUBATION).
