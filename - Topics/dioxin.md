- (2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) A toxic solid formed in the manufacture of the herbicide 2,4,5-T; it was present as an impurity in Agent Orange, used as a defoliant during the Vietnam War. It is the most toxic member of a group of compounds (called dioxins) that occur widely as environmental pollutants, being produced during combustion processes (e.g. in incinerators) and as byproducts in various industrial manufacturing processes. Dioxins decompose very slowly and may be concentrated in the food chain; in animals they are stored in fat. Exposure to high levels of dioxins can cause skin disfigurement (chloracne) and may result in fetal defects. Because of their toxicity, many countries have imposed strict controls to reduce industrial emissions of dioxins.
