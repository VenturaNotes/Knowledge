- (1) (converse) (of a binary relation R) A derived relation $R^{-1}$ such that $$\begin{align}&\text{whenever x R y} \\ &\text{then y }R^{-1} \space x\end{align}$$where $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary elements of the set to which R applies. The inverse of 'greater than' defined on integers is 'less than'.
- The inverse of a function $$f: X \to Y$$(if it exists) is another function, $f^{-1}$, such that $$f^{-1}: Y \to X$$and $$f(x) = y \text{ implies } f^{-1}(y) = x$$It is not necessary that a function has an inverse function.
- Since for each monadic function $f$ a relation R can be introduced such that $$R = \{(x,y)|f(x) = y\}$$then the inverse relation can be defined as $$R^{-1}\{(y,x)|f(x)=y\}$$and this always exists. When $f^{-1}$ exists (i.e. $R^{-1}$ is itself a function) $f$ is said to be invertible and $f^{-1}$ is the inverse (or converse) function. Then, for all x, $$f^{-1}(f(x)) = x$$To illustrate, if $f$ is a function that maps each wife to her husband and $g$ maps each husband to his wife, then $f$ and $g$ are inverses of one another.
