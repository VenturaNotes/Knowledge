- (wrap; wrap account) A portfolio consisting of investments in a wide range of unit trusts, open-end trusts, and similar vehicles; the balance of the portfolio can be tailored to the requirements of the purchaser. Wraps are generally sold through intermediaries such as financial advisers, so that the investor deals directly with a single fund manager and pays a single annual fee.
