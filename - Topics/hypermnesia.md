- $n$. Enhanced power of memory, usually under the influence of hypnosis or truth drugs, though the effects may be illusory. The term is also used to denote a form of reminiscence (2), for material such as pictures or prose passages, in successive reproduction with short intervals between successive tests. For example, people who view a video recording of a burglary and are then tested repeatedly over a few hours or days for their recall of critical details have shown steady improvement across the repeated tests. If the interval between tests is increased to a week, then recall tends to decline. Compare amnesia. \[From Greek hyper over + mnasthai to remember + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
