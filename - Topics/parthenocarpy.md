- The formation of fruit without prior fertilization of the flower by pollen. The resulting fruits are seedless and therefore do not contribute to the reproduction of the plant; examples are bananas and pineapples. Because this is regarded as a desirable trait, parthenocarpic cultivars of bananas, figs, breadfruit, and various other fruit crops are grown commercially. Plant hormones, such as gibberellins and auxins, can induce parthenocarpy, as can artificial fertilization using nonviable pollen.
