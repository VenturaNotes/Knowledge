- An offence introduced by the Corporate Manslaughter and Corporate Homicide Act 2007. It occurs where: (i) the death of a person (such as an employee or a customer) has been caused by a gross breach of a relevant duty of care owed to that person by the company; and (ii) the breach involved a serious failing by senior management in the way the company's activities were organized or managed. The offence can be committed only by companies and certain other organizations (including partnerships and trade unions). Individuals, such as directors of a company, can also be prosecuted under the common law for manslaughter.
