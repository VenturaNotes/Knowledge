- (postinfective polyneuropathy) a disease of the peripheral nerves in which there is numbness and weakness in the limbs. It usually develops 1-28 days after a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection (commonly with Campylobacter): antibodies directed against the pathogen's cell-surface antigens attack similar antigens on the myelin sheaths of the host's peripheral nerves. Involvement of the respiratory muscles may require mechanical ventilation. Recovery is variable and often prolonged (there is a $10 \%$ mortality rate). Treatment with immunoglobulins (intravenous) or with plasma exchange may speed recovery and reduce long-term disability. See POLYRADICULITIS. \[G. Guillain (1876-1961) and A. Barr√© (1880-1967), French neurologists]
