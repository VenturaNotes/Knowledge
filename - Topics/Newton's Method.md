- An iterative technique for solving one or more nonlinear equations. For the single equation$$f(x)=0$$the iteration is$$\begin{aligned}& x_{n+1}=x_{n}-f\left(x_{n}\right) / f^{\prime}\left(x_{n}\right) \\& n=0,1,2, \ldots\end{aligned}$$where $x_{0}$ is an approximation to the solution. For the system$$\begin{aligned}&f(x) =0 \\&f  =\left(f_{1}, f_{2}, \ldots, f_{n}\right)^{\mathrm{T}} \\&x =\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)^{\mathrm{T}}\end{aligned}$$the iteration takes the mathematical form$$\begin{aligned}& x_{n+1}=x_{n}-J\left(x_{n}\right)^{-1} f\left(x_{n}\right) \\& n=0,1,2, \ldots\end{aligned}$$where $J(x)$ is the $n^{\prime} n$ matrix whose $i, j$th element is$$\partial f_{i}(x) / \partial x_{j}$$In practice each iteration is carried out by solving a system of linear equations. Subject to appropriate conditions the iteration converges quadratically (ultimately an approximate squaring of the error occurs). The disadvantage of the method is that a constant recalculation of $J$ may be too time-consuming and so the method is most often used in a modified form, e.g. with approximate derivatives. Since Newton's method is derived by a linearization of $f(x)$, it is capable of generalization to other kinds of nonlinear problems, e.g. boundary-value problems (see ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS).
