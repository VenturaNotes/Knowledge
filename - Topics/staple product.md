- In reference to production, the most important product of an area or country. Domination of an economy by a single product is unusual except for some major oil-producing countries, such as Kuwait, and a number of less developed countries. Most modern economies have no single staple product, though some local areas are heavily dependent on particular industries. In reference to consumption, staple products are goods purchased and consumed on a regular basis, such as basic food and clothing. Typically, these are necessities and have few or no substitutes.
