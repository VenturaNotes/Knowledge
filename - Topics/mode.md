## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The most frequent or most likely value of a random variable. For a discrete probability distribution, the mode is the value that has the highest probability to occur. For a continuous distribution, the mode is the value that corresponds to the maximum of the probability density function; if there is more than one local maximum the distribution is said to be multimodal. For a sample of observations, the mode is the value that is observed most frequently. The number of children in a family, for example, may be 0 or any whole number: if the mode is 2 this means there are more families with two children than of any other particular size.
