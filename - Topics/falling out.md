- $n$. A culture-bound syndrome found among communities in the southern United States and the Caribbean, characterized by a sudden collapse, occurring either without warning or after a brief spell of dizziness, followed by a sensation of blindness, although the eyes are open, and an inability to speak or move although the person is aware of what is happening in the immediate vicinity. It is sometimes interpreted as a conversion disorder or a dissociative disorder. Also called blacking out.
