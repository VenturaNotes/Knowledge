- (1) An agreement between two counterparties that mutual obligations will be settled by a single payment. 
- (2) A method of reducing bank charges in which two related companies offset their receipts and payments with each other, usually monthly. In this way a single payment and receipt is made for the period instead of a number, which saves on both transaction costs and paperwork. See also MULTILATERAL NETTING.
