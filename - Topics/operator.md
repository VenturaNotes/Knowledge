## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A term variously used in mathematics and which is typically synonymous with function. The terms ‘linear operator ’ and ‘differential operator’ are comm on, where the elements of the domain are themselves functions.
## Source[^2]
- (1) A person responsible for the immediate supervision of the hardware of a computer system. 
- (2) A function that can be applied to one or more operands so as to yield a result. It is (usually) a symbol representing an operation to be carried out, as opposed to a variable, which represents a data value. See also ARITHMETIC OPERATOR, LOGIC OPERATION, RELATIONAL OPERATOR, PRECEDENCE.
## Source[^3]
- The term operator is used in the computer programming industry to describe a character in computer code that instructs a system to perform a logical or mathematical function. For instance, operator “+“ is used in computer code to either add numerical value together or to thread together literals and variables into a single data string (sequence of characters in computer code). Programmers use operators to compose the computer code that allows software programs to function properly.
