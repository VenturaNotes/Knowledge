- (psilosis) $n$. impaired absorption of food due to disease of the small intestine. Tropical sprue is seen in people from temperate regions who move to the tropics. It is characterized by diarrhoea (usually steatorrhoea), an inflamed tongue (glossitis), anaemia, and weight loss; the lining of the small intestine becomes inflamed and atrophied, leading to vitamin and micronutrient deficiencies. Its cause is unknown, but infection is most likely. Treatment with antibiotics and folic acid is usually effective, but the condition often improves spontaneously on return to a temperate climate. See also COELIAC DISEASE; MALABSORPTION.
