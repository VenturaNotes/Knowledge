Over the next few months it spread to many countries in Asia, Europe, and North and South America before being contained (the last case in this outbreak occurred in June 2003). According to the World Health Organization (WHO), a total of 8098 people worldwide contracted SARS during the 2003 outbreak; 774 of these died.
