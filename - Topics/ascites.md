## Source[^2]
- (hydroperitoneum) $n$. the accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity, causing abdominal swelling. Causes include infections (such as tuberculosis), heart failure, portal hypertension, cirrhosis, and various cancers (particularly of the ovary and liver): the presence of malignant cells in the fluid, revealed by cytological examination, is usually evidence of secondary spread. Obstruction to the drainage of lymph from the abdomen results in chylous ascites (see CHYLE). Pancreatic ascites, due to direct communication between the pancreatic duct and the peritoneal cavity, usually following trauma or severe pancreatitis, is diagnosed by very high amylase levels in aspirated ascitic fluid. Treatment includes diuretics and ascitic drainage (paracentesis) if there is associated respiratory distress. See also OEDEMA.
