- Any device that measures an organismâ€™s oxygen uptake. Simple respirometers consist of a chamber (in which the organism is placed) connected to a manometer. Carbon dioxide is chemically removed from the chamber so that only oxygen uptake is measured. Human oxygen consumption is generally measured by a device known as a spirometer, which can also be used to measure depth and frequency of breathing.
