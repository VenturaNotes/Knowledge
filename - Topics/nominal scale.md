- $n$. A discrete form of data classification in which items are not quantified or even arranged in order but are merely allocated to different (often numbered) categories as, for example, in assigning numbers to categories of books in a library classification system. In nominal scaling, the numbers serve only as names for the categories to which the items belong. See also MEASUREMENT LEVEL, SCALE (1). Compare ABSOLUTE SCALE, INTERVAL SCALE, LOG-INTERVAL SCALE, ORDINAL SCALE, RATIO SCALE. \[From Latin nomen a name]
