- The theory that in a perfect capital market the value of a firm is independent of the method of financing used. Capital can be raised by borrowing, issuing equity shares, or retaining profits instead of paying dividends. The Modiglianiâ€“Miller theorem asserts that in a perfect capital market it does not matter to a firm whether it uses debt or equity, or what dividend policy it follows. The fact that firms do worry about their leverage and dividend policies reflects the effects of the tax system and imperfection in the capital market.
## Source[^2]
- (MM hypothesis) A theory of corporate finance, first advanced by Franco Modigliani and Merton Miller in 1958, which holds that the capital structure of a firm has, under certain assumptions, no effect on the firm's value. The theorem states that, in a perfect market with no taxation or costs of financial distress, neither the relative levels of debt and equity in a firm, nor its dividend policy, would affect the market value. In real-world markets, this is by no means the case.
