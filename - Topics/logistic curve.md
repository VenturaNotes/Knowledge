- A curve showing the behavior over time of a variable $x$ where $a<x<b$, and the growth of $x$ is governed by the rule $d x / d t=\alpha(x-$ a) $(b-x)$. This type of curve can be fitted as an approximation to economic phenomena such as the proportion of consumers using a new product, or firms using a new technique.
