- $n$. a necklike part, especially the cervix uteri (neck of the uterus), which projects at its lower end into the vagina. The cervical canal passes through it, linking the cavity of the uterus with the vagina; the canal is lined with mucous membrane (see ENDOCERVIX) and normally contains mucus, the viscosity of which changes throughout the menstrual cycle. The cervix is capable of wide dilation during childbirth.

- (pl. cervices) A narrow or necklike part of an organ. The cervix of the uterus (cervix uteri) leads to the vagina. Glands in its walls produce mucus, whose viscosity changes according to the oestrous cycle. During labor, the cervix enlarges greatly to allow passage of the fetus.
