- Direct to home (DTH) is an umbrella term that refers to the distribution of television broadcasting services, via satellite, to a subscriber’s home. Through a regular subscription service, DTH companies provide individual reception signals to each home. These broadcasting signals are sent through an integrated receiver-decoder (IRD), an electronic device that picks up broadcast signals and decodes them, then sends the signals to subscribers' homes via a satellite dish. The satellite dish collects the signals, then relays them, through a beam, into the consumer’s device.
