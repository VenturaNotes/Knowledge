- $n$. A disorder in DSM-5 characterized by a pattern of behavior involving intentional feigning of physical or psychological signs or symptoms in another person who is being cared for, without any economic or other external incentive for the behaviour, the motive being to procure medical treatment for the person being cared for and thereby to assume a sick role by proxy. According to the British paediatrician (Samuel) Roy (later Sir Roy) Meadow (born 1933), who was the first to identify the phenomenon and who coined the alternative term Munchausen by proxy syndrome (MBPS) in 1977, it is not a psychological disorder but a form of physical or psychological abuse of children or others being cared for. See also factitious disorder. Compare BORDERLINE PERSONALITY DISORDER, CONVERSION DISORDER, MALINGERING, SOMATIC SYMPTOM DISORDER.
