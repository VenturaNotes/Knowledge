- a cell or group of cells found between muscle fibres that responds to stretching of the muscle by transmitting impulses to the central nervous system through the sensory nerves. Stretch receptors are part of the proprioceptor system necessary for the performance of coordinated muscular activity.
## Source[^2]
- A specialized cell or group of cells found in muscles (see musCle SPINDLE) or tendons that is sensitive to mechanical stress. When muscles or tendons are stretched, the strain is registered by special sensory nerve cells and converted (transduced) into nerve impulses, which are transmitted to the central nervous system. See GOLGI TENDON ORGAN; MECHANORECEPTOR.
