- adj. describing the characteristic radiographic appearance of a stricture of the large bowel resulting from the presence of a cancer, observed in a double-contrast barium enema study. The bowel is narrow with an irregular outline and the ends of the stricture are 'shouldered', giving the appearance of an apple core after eating the fleshy portion of the fruit. This contrasts with smooth tapering strictures, which are commonly benign.
