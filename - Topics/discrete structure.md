- A set of discrete elements on which certain operations are defined. Discrete implies noncontinuous and therefore discrete sets include finite and countable sets but not uncountable sets such as the real numbers. The term discrete structure covers many of the concepts of modern algebra, including integer arithmetic, monoids, semigroups, groups, graphs, lattices, semirings, rings, fields, and subsets of these.
