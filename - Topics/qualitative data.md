- Data that can be classified into categories or groups according to characteristics or features, rather than by a measurement. Sometimes the same data can be treated as qualitative or quantitative, depending on the research context. For example, data on education can be treated as quantitative when each individual is characterized by the number of years in formal education, or qualitative when individuals are characterized by the highest degree achieved. See also CATEGORICAL VARIABLE.
