- (of a set $S$ on which some dyadic operation ${ }^{\circ}$ is defined) An element $e$ with the property that

  

$$

a^{} e=e^{} a=a

$$

  

for all elements $a$ in $S$. It can be shown that $e$ is unique. In normal arithmetic, 0 and 1 are the identity elements associated with addition and multiplication respectively. In a Boolean algebra, 0 and 1 are the identities associated with the OR and the AND operations respectively.
