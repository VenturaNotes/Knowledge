- The services an organization offers to its customers, especially of industrial goods and expensive consumer goods, such as computers or cars. Customer services cover a wide variety of forms, including after-sales servicing, such as a repair and replacement service, extended guarantees, regular mailings of information, and, more recently, freephone telephone calls in case of complaints. The appeal of a company's products is greatly influenced by the customer services it offers.
