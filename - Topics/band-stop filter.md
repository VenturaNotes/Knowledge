- A filtering device that permits only those components in the frequency domain whose frequencies lie below one critical value or above another (higher) critical value to pass through with little attenuation; all components whose frequencies lie between the critical values are attenuated.
- If the two critical values are very close together, the device is called a [[notch filter]]. Notch filters are used, for example, in modems in order to prevent certain components of the data signal from interfering with equipment in the telephone system. See also BAND-PASS FILTER, HIGH-PASS FILTER, LOW-PASS FILTER
- Band-reject filter is another name for band-stop filter
