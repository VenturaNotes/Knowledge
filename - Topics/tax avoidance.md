- (tax planning) Minimizing tax liabilities legally and by means of full disclosure to the tax authorities. In the UK there has generally been a clear distinction between tax avoidance and illegal tax evasion, with the authorities legislating to forbid specific arrangements where this seems desirable (see Westminster DOCTRINE). However, the recently introduced General Anti-Abuse Rule breaks new ground in its attempt to outlaw all tax avoidance measures that can be deemed 'artificial and abusive'.

- Arranging one's affairs to reduce the amount of tax that has to be paid. Tax avoidance may be legal, as contrasted with tax evasion which is the deliberate non-payment of tax that is in fact legally due, for example by making false tax returns. While in theory tax avoidance and tax evasion are entirely distinct, in many practical cases it requires a court to rule which description applies to any specific set of transactions. See also General Anti-Avoidance Rule.
