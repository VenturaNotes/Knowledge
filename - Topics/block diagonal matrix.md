- A square matrix in which the only non-zero elements form square submatrices arranged along the main diagonal. A very simple case is shown below where a $2 \times 2$ matrix and a $1 \times 1$ matrix make up a block diagonal $3 \times 3$ matrix.$$\left[\begin{array}{ccc}

3 & -2 & 0 \\

4 & 2 & 0 \\

0 & 0 & -1

\end{array}\right]$$
