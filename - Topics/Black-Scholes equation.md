- An equation used to value financial options. The Black-Scholes equation is based on a model of equilibrium in financial markets with continuous trading. That is, asset prices potentially change at every instant in time. The model assumes that there is a risk-free asset and that all excess returns are eliminated by arbitrage. The method of Black-Scholes is to develop a partial differential equation that the price of every option must satisfy. This equation states that the value, $V$, of an option must satisfy$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2} S^{2} \frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial S^{2}}+r S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}-r V=0$$where $S$ is the value at time $t$ of the underlying asset, $r$ is the risk-free rate of return, and $\sigma^{2}$ is the variance of the return on the underlying asset. The value of a particular option is found by solving the partial differential equation using as boundary conditions the characteristics of that option.

- A partial differential equation modelling the dynamics of a financial market and which provided estimates for (European-style) stock options. It states$$\frac{\partial V}{\partial t}+\frac{1}{2} \sigma^{2} S^{2} \frac{\partial^{2} V}{\partial S^{2}}+r S \frac{\partial V}{\partial S}-r V=0$$where $V$ is the option's price, $S$ is the stock's price, $r$ is the interest rate, and $\sigma$ represents volatility of the stock price.
