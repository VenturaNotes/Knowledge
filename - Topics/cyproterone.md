It is used to treat hypersexuality disorders and advanced prostate cancer in men; combined with ethinylestradiol as co-cyprindiol, it is used to treat acne and hirsutism in women. Common side-effects include tiredness, loss of strength, inhibition of sperm formation, infertility, and breast enlargement (gynaecomastia). Because of a risk of liver damage, liver function tests should be carried out before and during treatment.
