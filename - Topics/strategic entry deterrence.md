- Actions undertaken by a firm to deter competitors from entering their markets. Such actions could include making a large investment of sunk capital, which makes it unlikely that rivals could drive it out, or offering long-term low-price contracts to customers. For any given entry decisions by rivals, these policies may reduce profits or even lead to temporary losses, but they may pay by discouraging entry. See also BARRIERS TO ENTRY.
