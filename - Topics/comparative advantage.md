- Comparative advantage in an economic model is the advantage over others in producing a particular good
## Source[^2]
- The ability of an individual or group to carry out a particular economic activity more efficiently than another activity, allowing for specialization and trade benefits
## Source[^3]
- Every country has at least one comparative advantage in something
## Source[^4]
- A country is said to have a comparative advantage in production of a good if it has lower opportunity cost in producing this good compared to another country or the rest of the world. If countries specialize in the production of those goods in which they have a comparative advantage then free trade improves production and consumption efficiency by increasing aggregate output with the same amount of resources and expanding the choice for consumers. See also ABSOLUTE ADVANTAGE.
