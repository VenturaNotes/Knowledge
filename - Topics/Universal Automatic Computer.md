- The US's first commercially available computer system, delivered in 1951 slightly later than the Ferranti Mark I. Its memory was in the form of mercury delay lines. It was the product of the EckertMauchly Computer Corporation, formed in 1948 by the designers of ENIAC. From 1951 through the mid-1950s over 40 machines were produced. The company was acquired by Remington-Rand Inc., which merged with Sperry Corporation in 1955 to form Sperry Rand Corp. Sperry later merged with Burroughs Corp. to form Unisys.
