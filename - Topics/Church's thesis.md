- The hypothesis, put forward by Alonzo Church in 1935, that any function on the natural numbers that can be computed by an algorithm can be defined by a formula of the lambda calculus. See also Church-Turing THESIS.

## Source[^2]
- (Church-Turing thesis) The principle that any definition of a computable function on the natural numbers$\textemdash$one that can be effectively implemented, for example by an algorithm$\textemdash$will lead to the same computable functions as in Church's and Turing's work. As such, the thesis is unprovable, though no counterexample has been found amongst subsequent alternative definitions of computable.
