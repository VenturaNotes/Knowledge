- AKA group table
- The multiplication table for a group. Given a finite group G = {$g_1, ...g_n$}, then the product $g_ig_j$ appears in the $ith$ row and $jth$ column of the table. As pre-multiplication by $g_i$ and post-multiplication by $g_j$ are both invertible, then a Cayley table is a Latin square

## Source[^2]
- (composition table, operation table) A tabular means of describing a finite group, first used by the 19th-century mathematician Arthur Cayley. To illustrate, the set

  

$$

\{1,-1, i,-i\}

$$

  

forms a group under the dyadic operation ${ }^{\circ}$ as described by the Cayley table shown in the diagram. The value of $-1^{\circ} i$, for example, is $-i$. The name composition table is usually used when the group operation is composition of functions.

| | $\circ$ | 1 | $-1$ | $i$ | $-i$ |

| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |

| | 1 | 1 | $-1$ | $i$ | $-i$ |

| left operand | $-1$ | $-1$ | 1 | $-i$ | $i$ |
