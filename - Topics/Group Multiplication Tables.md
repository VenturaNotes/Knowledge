- AKA group table
- The multiplication table for a group. Given a finite group G = {$g_1, ...g_n$}, then the product $g_ig_j$ appears in the $ith$ row and $jth$ column of the table. As pre-multiplication by $g_i$ and post-multiplication by $g_j$ are both invertible, then a Cayley table is a Latin square
