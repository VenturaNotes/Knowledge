- adj. denoting a neurological state in which the functions of the higher centres of the brain are eliminated. This is brought about in experimental animals by cutting across the brain below the cerebrum, but certain injuries to the brain in humans may cause the same severe neurological signs as occur in a decerebrate animal.
