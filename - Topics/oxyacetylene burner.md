## Source [^1]
- A welding or cutting torch that burns a mixture of oxygen and acetylene (ethyne) in a specially designed jet. The flame temperature of about 3300°C enables all ferrous metals to be welded. For cutting, the point at which the steel is to be cut is preheated with the oxyacetylene flame and a powerful jet of oxygen is then directed onto the steel. The oxygen reacts with the hot steel to form iron oxide and the heat of this reaction melts more iron, which is blown away by the force of the jet.
