## Source[^2]
- Currency is something tangible that is in circulation to be exchanged. Currency is issued by the government in the form of paper and coins. Currency has replaced bartering in the modern world. Currency and money are thought to have the same meaning, but this is not true. Money is a system of value in society that provides the means for exchange, while currency is a tangible form of money. Today, a new form of currency has emerged called cryptocurrency, which is a virtual exchange that has no physical form and is stored electronically. The market for currency trading is created by the exchange rate, which is the current value of any currency relative to another. For example, the U.S. dollar to euros. The foreign exchange market consists of professionals investing for themselves or large corporations.
