- $n$. A category of knowledge that is distinct from both declarative knowledge (knowing that) and procedural knowledge (knowing how). It consists of knowledge of people, places, and things, and although it may include declarative knowledge it need not necessarily do so, as when one knows a color, or a smell, or a face, but cannot state any facts about it. This class of knowledge was discussed by the Welsh philosopher Bertrand (Arthur William) Russell (1872-1970) in The Problems of Philosophy (1912) and is poorly understood in psychology.
