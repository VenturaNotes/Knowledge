- A next-generation network (NGN) is a broad term that can be used to describe the future of technology, particularly the continued expansion of mobile network infrastructure to allow for faster and more reliable communication between devices. It may also involve the evolution of wireless devices, network infrastructure, and more. The particulars that define an NGN will always evolve, but the idea behind such a network remains the same.
