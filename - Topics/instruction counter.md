- (program counter) A counting register that normally increments in each instruction cycle to obtain the program sequence (i.e. the sequence of instructions) from the memory locations. This counter will have its contents changed by branch instructions to obtain the next instruction from the branch target. The instruction counter forms part of the processor status word; this enables subsequent restarting of an interrupted program.
