- (intravenous drip) n. apparatus for the continuous infusion (transfusion) of blood, plasma, saline, glucose solution, or other fluid into a vein. The fluid flows under gravity from a suspended bottle through a cannula inserted into the patient's vein. The rate of flow can be adjusted according to the rate of drips seen in a transparent section of the tube, but many infusions are now controlled by electronically regulated infusion pumps.
