- An SFM is a software system that stores messages sent from one computer to another. It holds them on behalf of the sender until the destination machine becomes available to receive them. This function allows two computers that are not constantly connected—such as a home computer and a laptop—to exchange files. The SFM on one machine acts as a server for the other.
