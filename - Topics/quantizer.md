## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An electronic device that can convert an analogue signal into a signal having values that are identical to the analogue signal only at discrete instants of time. The action is analogous to observing, i.e. sampling, the analogue signal, approximating it by the nearest preferred value and holding this value until the next observation time. The output signal thus consists of a number of steps between specified levels. See also DIGITIZER.
