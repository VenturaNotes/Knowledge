- A property or quantity that is not changed by one or more specified operations or transformations. For example, for a conic with equation $$Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2 + Dx + Ey + F = 0$$the quantity $B^2 - 4AC$ is invariant under a rotation of axes. The distance between two points and the angle between two lines are invariants under translations and rotations of the plane, but distance is not invariant under dilations, while angle is.
