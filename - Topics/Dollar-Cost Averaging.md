- Dollar-cost averaging, or DCA, is a term frequently used in the financial industry. It refers to a practice in which stocks and investments are paid for in smaller, regular payments over time. This helps avoid market fluctuations that can occur due to single, high-cost payments/investments. To use dollar-cost averaging, the total cost of the investment is divided into equal amounts and then paid over a pre-determined amount of time.
