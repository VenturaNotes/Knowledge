- The continuous random movement of microscopic solid particles (of about 1 micrometre in diameter) when suspended in a fluid medium. First observed by British botanist Robert Brown (1773-1858) in 1827 when studying pollen grains in water, it was originally thought to be the manifestation of some vital force. It was later recognized to be a consequence of bombardment of the particles by the continually moving molecules of the liquid. The smaller the particles the more extensive is the motion. It can be observed in the particles of a colloidal solution and in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of dead cells.
