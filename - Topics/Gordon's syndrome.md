- (pseudohypoaldosteronism type II, chloride shunt syndrome) an autosomal dominant condition associated with increased chloride absorption in the distal tubule leading to a syndrome of mild volume expansion, hypertension, and metabolic acidosis with otherwise normal renal function. Plasma renin and aldosterone are suppressed as a result of the volume expansion. Other features can include short stature, intellectual impairment, muscle weakness, and renal stones.
