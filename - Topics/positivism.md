- (1) A philosophical doctrine developed explicitly by the French philosopher and mathematician Auguste Comte (1798-1857), though it can be traced back through the French socialist thinker Claude-Henri de Rouvroy Comte de Saint-Simon (1760-1825) to the English philosopher and statesman Francis Bacon (1561-1626), according to which observation and experiment are the only sources of substantial knowledge. Comte believed that human thought passes through three stages: theological, metaphysical, then finally positive. See also EMPIRICISM. 
- (2) Another name for logical positivism. See also Frankfurt SCHOOL, OPERATIONALISM.
