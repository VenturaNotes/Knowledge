The doctrine associated especially with the English philosopher John Locke (1632-1704), the Irish philosopher Bishop George Berkeley (1685-1753), and the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711-76), collectively known as British empiricists, that all elements of knowledge$\textemdash$or, in a less extreme version, all factual knowledge as distinct from logically deduced inferences$\textemdash$is derived from experience, adherents to this view often taking the experimental method as a prototype of knowledge acquisition in general. See also a priori, a posteriori, Hume's fork, inference, logical empiricism, logical positivism, Molyneux's question, positivism (1), tabula rasa, transactionalism. Compare innate IDEA, NATIVISM, RATIONALISM (1, 2). empiricist adj. $n$.
