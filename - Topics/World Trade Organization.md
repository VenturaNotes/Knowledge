- (WTO) An international trade organization formed under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to replace GATT and implement measures agreed at the Uruguay round in 1994. The WTO's aims are to continue the work of GATT in agreeing international trading rules and furthering the liberalization of international trade. The WTO has wider and more permanent powers than GATT and extends its jurisdiction into such aspects of trading as intellectual property rights. WTO rules are very important in international trade contracts. The highest authority of the WTO is the Ministerial Conference, held approximately every two years. There are currently (2015) 161 members of the WTO.
