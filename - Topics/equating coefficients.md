- Let $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ be polynomials, and let $$\begin{align} &f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots + a_1x + a_0, \\&g(x) = b_nx^n + b_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+b_1x + b_0, \end{align}$$where it is not necessarily assumed that $a_n \ne 0$ and $b_n \ne 0$. If $f(x) = g(x)$ for all values of $x$, then $a_n = b_n, a_{n-1} = b_{n-1},...,a_1 = b_1, a_0 = b_0.$ 
- The above is true by definition of the equality of polynomials. Note that, for a prime $p$, the polynomials $x^p$ and $x$ take the same values for all $x$ mod $p$ (as a consequence of Fermat's Little Theorem). However, $x^p$ and $x$ are distinct polynomials, having different coefficients.
