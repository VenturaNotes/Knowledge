- $n$. An instrument designed to measure reflection-impulsivity by requiring the respondent to select repeatedly from several alternative figures the one that matches a standard. The number of errors and the time required to complete the test are recorded, and people with below-median errors and above-median response times are classified as reflective; people with above-median errors and below-median response times impulsive; people with below-median errors and below-median response times quick; and people with above-median errors and above-median response times slow. The test was developed in 1966 by the US psychologist Jerome Kagan (born 1929). MFFT abbrev.
