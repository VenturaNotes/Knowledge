- A theory, first formulated in 1966 by R. H. MacArthur and E. R. Pianka, stating that natural selection favors animals whose behavioral strategies maximize their net energy intake per unit time spent foraging. Such time includes both searching for prey and handling (i.e. killing and eating) it. The theory was originally devised in an attempt to explain why, out of the wide range of foods available, animals often restrict themselves to a few preferred types. The prediction is that an animal strikes a balance between two contrasting strategies: spending a long time (i.e. using more energy) searching for highly 'profitable' food items, or devoting minimal time (i.e. using less energy) to more common but less profitable food items. Various factors can cause animals to deviate from optimal foraging. For example, the risk of predation may force the animal to select less profitable food items in a relatively safe location, rather than opting for the energetically most efficient feeding strategy.
