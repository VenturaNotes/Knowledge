- induction The principle of induction defined as follows. Let $S$ be a set on which the partial ordering $\leq$ is defined and which contains no infinite decreasing sequences (where decreasing is defined by the ordering relation). If $P$ is some predicate and if the following two conditions hold:
	- (a) let $a$ be a smallest element of $S$, i.e. there is no $x$ in $S$ such that $x \leq a$, then $P(a)$ is true;
	- (b) for each element $s$ in $S$, if $P(x)$ is true for each $x$ in $S$ with $x \leq s$, and from this it follows that $P(s)$ is true,
- then $P(s)$ is true for all $s$ in $S$. Structural induction tends to be used in proving properties of recursive programs.
