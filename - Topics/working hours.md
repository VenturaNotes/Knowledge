- The EU Working Time Directive of 1993 required all member states to limit the working week of employees to 48 hours, except where employees have agreed otherwise. The provisions of this directive were enacted by the British government in the Working Time Regulations (1998). Key elements of the Regulations require a maximum working week of 48 hours, daily rest breaks, weekly rest periods, and annual paid leave of 24 days for those working a five-day week (rising to 28 days from April 2009). They are enforced by the Health and Safety Executive.
