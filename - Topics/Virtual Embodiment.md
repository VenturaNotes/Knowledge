- Virtual embodiment is an illusion that makes one feel like they are substituting their physical body for a virtual avatar. Virtual embodiment lets a person momentarily exist within a virtual environment. The experience is facilitated using a virtual reality gear that allows an individual to physically react to the external stimuli of the virtual environment in real-life.
- Companies that develop virtual reality gaming experiences and simulations use the concept of virtual embodiment to allow people to experience situations and environments that are either extremely risky or impossible to experience in real life.
