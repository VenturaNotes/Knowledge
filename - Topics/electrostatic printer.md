- A type of printer (no longer in widespread use) in which the required image is first written as a pattern of electrostatic charge, and is then made visible by bringing the pattern into contact with particles of pigment that carry a charge of opposite polarity. The pigment is only attracted to the charge pattern and is subsequently fused or bonded to the paper.
- In some literature the term is used to refer to all printers in which an electrostatic image is formed as one of the steps in the process, including electrophotographic printers.
