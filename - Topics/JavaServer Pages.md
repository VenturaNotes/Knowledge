- Trademark A technology from Sun to generate server-side dynamic web pages, introduced in 1999. Its core is an extension to HTML syntax that allows program fragments, either written in Java or using special XML tags, to be embedded in web page templates; these fragments are executed by a JSP-aware web server and their results are combined with the template to form the web page sent to the client. Pages may also be generated by Java classes. See also Active Server Pages.
