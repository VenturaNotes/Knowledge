- $n$. A subsystem of the visual system, based on direction-sensitive neurons, that computes the movement of objects from the movement of images across the retina, but that is unable on its own to distinguish between retinal movements caused by movements in the environment and those caused by movements of the observer's eyes and head. See also EYE-HEAD MOVEMENT SYSTEM, REAFFERENCE.
