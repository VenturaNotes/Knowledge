- $n$. A form of nystagmus occurring continuously during visual fixation (1), consisting of ocular drifts with visual angles up to about 5 minutes of arc (5/60 of a degree), microsaccades between 1 and 2 minutes of arc, and ocular tremors of about 30 seconds of arc (1/120 of a degree). That these eye movements are essential to vision is shown dramatically by experiments on stabilized retinal images.
