- Automated System Operations (ASO) are the aspects of a computer. With ASO, a computer can operate without the physical presence of another human. This involves hardware (such as wireless connections) or software (such as appropriate operating systems or remote connectivity programs). They allow for systems to be accessed from afar. ASO also involves automated functioning, like macros. These macros enable computers to work without any intervention.
