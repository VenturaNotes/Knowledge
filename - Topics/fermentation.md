## Synthesis

- $n$. the biochemical process by which organic substances, particularly carbohydrate compounds, are decomposed by the action of enzymes to provide chemical energy. An example is alcoholic fermentation, in which enzymes in yeast decompose sugar to form ethyl alcohol and carbon dioxide.
## Source[^2]
- The oxidation of glucose or other food substances by living cells to produce lactic acid or alcohol and energy in the form of ATP. It occurs in many cell types (e.g. muscle cells) when oxygen is limiting and in certain microorganisms, e.g. yeasts and some bacteria. All fermentations use the series of chemical reactions known as glycolysis to produce ATP by substrate-level phosphorylation. This involves reduction of the coenzyme $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$to NADH , and the two types of fermentation are distinguished by the way in which the cell regenerates the $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$so that the glycolysis can continue. In alcoholic fermentation, pyruvate (the end product of glycolysis) is converted to two molecules each of acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. Each acetaldehyde molecule is then reduced by NADH to yield a molecule of ethanol, in the process regenerating $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$. This is the basis of the baking and brewing industries (see BAKER's YEAST). In lactic-acid fermentation, which occurs in many microorganisms and (when sugar is in short supply) in animal cells, the pyruvate is reduced directly to lactic acid by NADH , regenerating $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$without producing carbon dioxide. Compare RESPIRATION.
