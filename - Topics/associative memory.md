- (content-addressable memory, CAM) A memory that is capable of determining whether a given datum$\textemdash$the search word$\textemdash$is contained in one of its addresses or locations. This may be accomplished by a number of mechanisms. In some cases parallel combinational logic is applied at each word in the memory and a test is made simultaneously for coincidence with the search word. In other cases the search word and all of the words in the memory are shifted serially in synchronism; a single bit of the search word is then compared to the same bit of all of the memory words using as many single-bit coincidence circuits as there are words in the memory. Amplifications of the associative memory technique allow for masking the search word or requiring only a 'close' match as opposed to an exact match. Small parallel associative memories are used in cache memory and virtual memory mapping applications.
- Since parallel operations on many words are expensive (in hardware), a variety of stratagems are used to approximate associative memory operation without actually carrying out the full test described here. One of these uses hashing to generate a 'best guess' for a conventional address followed by a test of the contents of that address.
- Some associative memories have been built to be accessed conventionally (by words in parallel) and as serial comparison associative memories; these have been called [[orthogonal memory|orthogonal memories]]. See also ASSOCIATIVE ADDRESSING, ASSOCIATIVE PROCESSOR.
