- The purchase or sale of securities by the central bank as a means of changing interest rates and the money supply. This is one of the major instruments of monetary policy. If the central bank buys securities their prices rise, interest rates fall, and the money supply increases. If the central bank sells securities their prices fall, interest rates rise, and the money supply decreases.
