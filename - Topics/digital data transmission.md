- Digital data uses discrete discontinuous signals to represent its meanings. In a DC (direct current) transmission system, different voltage (or current) values are used to represent the values (usually 0 and 1). A digital transmission has a very low error rate and can be sent at very high speeds. Weak signals can be regenerated with low probability of cumulative error. Since all signals are made up of 0 s and 1 s , signals from many sources can be readily multiplexed using digital techniques. See MULTIPLEXING.
- For transmission over longer distances (over about 50 to 1000 meters) it is common to insert transformers and/or optoisolators to improve the signal integrity by breaking ground loops and eliminating common mode interference. Alternative methods use modems, fibre-optic cables, or wireless links. See also MODULATION.
