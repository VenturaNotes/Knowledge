## Source [^1]
- AKA Triple DES, Triple DEA, TDEA, or the Triple Data Encryption Algorithm
- Introduced in 1998, 3DES is a cryptographic [[cipher]]
	- #question What is a cryptographic cipher
- It is a symmetric key block cipher, meaning that the same key is used to encrypt and decrypt data in fixed-length groups of bits called blocks.
	- #question What does symmetric key block cipher? Can you split these terms up better?
	- #question What is meant by key?
	- #question What does encrypt mean?
	- #question What does decrypt mean?
	- #question What is meant by blocks? What is a fixed-length group of bits
	- Details[^2]
		- A symmetric key block cipher is a cryptographic algorithm that uses a single key to encrypt and decrypt blocks of data.
- Called "Triple DES" because it applies the DES ([[Data Encryption Standard]]) cipher three times when encrypting data. 
	- #question 
- When DES was created in 1976, it used a key size of 56 bits, a sufficient level of security to resist [[brute force attack|brute-force attacks]]. 
	- #question What does key size mean?
- Since then, computers have become cheaper and more powerful, enabling the 3DES algorithm to apply DES three times consecutively, essentially stopping brute force on modern computers.
	- #question How would applying DES 3 times consecutively work? Is the DES applied on a hash or something?
