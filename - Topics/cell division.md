- The process by which a parent cell divides into two daughter cells
## Source[^2]
- reproduction of cells by division first of the chromosomes (karyokinesis) and then of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis). Cell division to produce more body (somatic) cells is by mitosis; cell division during the formation of gametes is by meiosis.
## Source[^3]
- The formation of two or more daughter cells from a single mother cell. The nucleus divides first; this is followed by division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis) with the formation of a plasma membrane between the daughter nuclei. Mitosis produces two daughter nuclei that are identical to the original nucleus; in plants a cell plate forms between the new cells. Meiosis results in four daughter nuclei each with half the number of chromosomes in the mother cell nucleus. See also CELL CYCLE.
