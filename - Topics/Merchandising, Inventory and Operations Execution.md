- Merchandising, inventory, and operations execution (MIOE) is the process of planning how to bring products from concept to market. This procedure also reviews current operations to be improved upon with new technologies and processes. Reviews include everything from product development to supply chain management and distribution. This is done by considering what products are being sold, how much inventory is needed, and where the products will be sold.
