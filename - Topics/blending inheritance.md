## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The early theory that assumed that hereditary substances from parents merge together in their offspring. Mendel showed that this does not occur (see MENDEL'S LAWS). In breeding experiments an appearance of blending may result from codominant alleles (see CODOMINANCE) and quantitative inheritance, but close study shows that the alleles retain their identity through successive generations. Compare PARTICULATE INHERITANCE.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A once-popular doctrine, subsequently discredited following the general acceptance of Mendelian genetics, that the intermediate characteristics of hybrids (1) result from a physical merging or mixing of the substances carrying the parental characteristics rather than from the recombination of unchanged particulate hereditary factors (genes). Compare PARTICULATE INHERITANCE.
