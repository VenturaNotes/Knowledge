- $n$. a firm nodule that appears singly on the skin, grows to $1-2 \mathrm{~cm}$ across in about 6 weeks, and usually disappears gradually during the next few months. Men are affected more often than women, commonly between the ages of 50 and 70. Keratoacanthomas occur mainly on the face; the cause is not known. Spontaneous healing may leave an unsightly scar; therefore treatment by curettage and cautery, or excision, may be required. The precise relationship of keratoacanthoma to squamous cell carcinoma is controversial.
