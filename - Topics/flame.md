- (1) An angry or abusive email message from one user to another. 
- (2) A flood of email messages from a large group of users to one specific user, who is judged to have offended against some standard of decent behavior. The individual messages may each be angry or abusive, but in some cases the actual messages may have no real purpose other than to overload the recipient's system, typically by sending as a mail message the entire contents of some very large data set such as the text of all the help files on a system.
