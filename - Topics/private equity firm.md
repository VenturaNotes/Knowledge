- An investment firm that seeks to make high returns by (i) obtaining a controlling interest in a target company (if this is a public company it is then taken private); (ii) subjecting it to radical financial and organizational restructuring over several years with the aim of maximizing profits; and (iii) selling the revitalized company or floating it on the stock exchange.

Critics of the private equity industry, which saw spectacular growth in the early 2000s, have accused it of an asset-stripping mentality; there have also been concerns about unfair tax advantages (see SHAREHOLDER DEBT; TAPER RELIEF) and exemptions from disclosure.
