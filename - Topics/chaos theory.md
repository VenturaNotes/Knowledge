- A theory that describes the behavior of deterministic nonlinear dynamic systems characterized by sensitivity to initial conditions. Sensitivity means that small differences in starting positions for the system result in large differences in the positions of the system achieved after a finite length of time. Chaos makes long-term forecasting impossible: even the smallest error in determining initial conditions will lead to a large divergence of forecast from actual outcome.
## Source[^2]
- A set of mathematical models according to which simple equations and initial conditions give rise to complicated paths for variables. Some of these models have been applied to financial markets.
