- $n$. the outer layer of the skin, which is divided into four layers (see illustration). The innermost Malpighian or germinative layer (stratum germinativum) consists of continuously dividing cells. The other three layers are continually renewed as cells from the germinative layer are gradually pushed outwards and become progressively impregnated with keratin (see KERATINIZATION). The outermost layer (stratum corneum) consists of dead cells whose cytoplasm has been entirely replaced by keratin. It is thickest on the soles of the feet and palms of the hands. epidermal $a d j$.

- (1) (in zoology) The outermost layer of cells of the body of an animal. In invertebrates the epidermis is normally only one cell thick and is covered by an impermeable cuticle. In vertebrates the epidermis is the thinner of the two layers of skin (compare DERMIS). It consists of a basal layer of actively dividing cells (see MALPIGHIAN LAYER), covered by layers of cells that become impregnated with keratin (see KERATINIZATION). The outermost layers of epidermal cells (the stratum corneum) form a water-resistant protective layer. The epidermis may bear a variety of specialized structures (e.g. feathers, hairs). 
- (2) (in botany) The outermost layer of cells covering a plant. It is overlaid by a cuticle and its functions are principally to protect the plant from injury and to reduce water loss. Some epidermal cells are modified to form guard cells (see STOMA) or hairs of various types (see PILIFEROUS LAYER). In woody plants the functions of the shoot epidermis are taken over by the periderm tissues (see CORK CAMBIUM) and in mature roots the epidermis is sloughed off and replaced by the hypodermis.
