- the backflow of urine from the bladder into the ureters. It is classified into primary or congenital vesicoureteric reflux, which is due to defective valves (which normally prevent reflux), or secondary, which is due to another condition (e.g. neuropathic bladder). Infection may be conveyed to the kidneys, causing recurrent attacks of acute pyelonephritis and scarring of the kidneys in childhood. Children with urinary infection must be investigated for reflux by cystoscopy; if the condition does not settle with antibiotic therapy corrective surgery must be performed.
