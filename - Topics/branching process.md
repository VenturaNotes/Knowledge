- A stochastic process where individuals have offspring. This might be modeled by having each individual in a generation of size $Z_{n}$ having offspring identically, independently distributed with $\operatorname{pgf} G(s)$. The pgf of $Z_{n}$ is then $G^{n}(s)$, where $G^{n}$ denotes $n$ applications of $G$. The probability that the population becomes extinct equals the smallest non-negative solution of the equation $s=G(s)$.
