- (goal-driven processing) A strategy for controlling inference procedures, or goal selection, during problem solving. In the case of a rule-based system, a rule whose consequent part matches the desired goal can be used to generate subgoals from the rule's antecedent part. The subgoals then become target goals and the process is repeated recursively until all subgoals have been satisfied. Compare FORWARD CHAINING.
