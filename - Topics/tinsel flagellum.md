- A type of eukaryotic flagellum (sense 2) with numerous hairlike projections (mastigonemes) along the shaft. They occur in certain protists, particularly the fungus-like oomycotes and hyphochytrids. The mastigonemes vary in nature: some are solid protein rods; others are tubular. They increase the power generated by the flagellum.
