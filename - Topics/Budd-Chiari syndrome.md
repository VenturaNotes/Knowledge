- a rare condition that follows occlusion of the hepatic veins by thrombosis or nonthrombotic processes. In the majority of cases the cause is unknown but hypercoagulable states, local or disseminated malignancy, and infection are possible causes. It is characterized by abdominal pain, abdominal distension due to ascites, and jaundice. Clinical examination may reveal hepatomegaly, and hepatic encephalopathy. \[G. Budd (1808-82), British physician; H. Chiari (18511916), German pathologist]
