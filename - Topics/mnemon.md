- $n$. A basic unit of memory, or the minimum physical change in the nervous system that encodes a memory. The term was introduced by the US neurobiologist Arthur Cherkin (1913-87) in an article in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America in 1966, in which he said: 'Mnemons are assumed to be relatively stable, with a half life of $10^{7}$ seconds (4 months) or more.' \[From Greek mneme memory, from mnasthai to remember]
