- Typically, a set whose elements are sets or have some further structure. Thus, one might discuss a family of curves. A family may be called an n-parameter family if n parameters need to be specified to identify an element of the family.

- (1) (in taxonomy) A category used in the classification of organisms that consists of one or several similar or closely related genera. Similar families are grouped into an order. Family names end in -aceae or -ae in botany (e.g. Cactaceae) and -idae in zoology (e.g. Equidae). The names are usually derived from a type genus (Cactus and Equus in the examples above) that is characteristic of the whole family (see TYPE SPECIMEN). In botany, families are sometimes called natural orders. 
- (2) (in molecular biology) A group of proteins with shared similarities in their amino-acid sequence, and often similarities in function, due to evolutionary divergence from a putative common ancestral protein. For example, the various types and subtypes of adrenoceptors can be considered as a protein family. See also GENE FAMILY.
