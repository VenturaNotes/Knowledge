- A particle is in equilibrium when it is at rest and the total force acting on it is zero for all time. These conditions are equivalent to saying that $r = r_0$ (a constant vector), $\dot r = 0$ and $\ddot r = 0$ for all time, where $r$ is the position vector of the particle. We then say that $r_0$ is an equilibrium or equilibrium position.
- Consider a rigid body experiencing a system of forces. Let $F$ be the total force and $M$ the moment of the forces about the origin. The rigid body is in equilibrium when it is at rest and $F=0$ and $M=0$ for all time
- A body, in equilibrium, is in stable equilibrium if, following a small change in its position, it returns to, or remains close to, the equilibrium position. It is in unstable equilibrium if, following a small change in its position, it continues to move further from the equilibrium position. See LINEAR THEORY OF EQUILIBRIA, LYAPUNOV STABILITY
