- A particle is in equilibrium when it is at rest and the total force acting on it is zero for all time. These conditions are equivalent to saying that $r = r_0$ (a constant vector), $\dot r = 0$ and $\ddot r = 0$ for all time, where $r$ is the position vector of the particle. We then say that $r_0$ is an equilibrium or equilibrium position.
- Consider a rigid body experiencing a system of forces. Let $F$ be the total force and $M$ the moment of the forces about the origin. The rigid body is in equilibrium when it is at rest and $F=0$ and $M=0$ for all time
- A body, in equilibrium, is in stable equilibrium if, following a small change in its position, it returns to, or remains close to, the equilibrium position. It is in unstable equilibrium if, following a small change in its position, it continues to move further from the equilibrium position. See LINEAR THEORY OF EQUILIBRIA, LYAPUNOV STABILITY

- An equilibrium can be defined either as a position of balance in the economy or, equivalently, as a situation in which no agent in the economy has any incentive to modify their chosen strategy. The first definition is derived from the perspective of equilibrium occurring when the forces of supply are balanced by the forces of demand. The second definition derives from the theory of games and is illustrated by the equilibrium of an oligopolistic market in which all firms are satisfied with their choice of output level given the choices of their rivals. Proving the existence of equilibrium and demonstrating the welfare properties of equilibrium are important steps in the analysis of an economic model. Equally important is analysis of the uniqueness and stability of equilibrium, and the determination of how changes in exogenous parameters affect the equilibrium (comparative statics). There are several explanations for the emphasis upon equilibrium. Historically, the economy was viewed as self-correcting so that if it were ever pushed away from equilibrium forces exist that would move it back towards equilibrium. The present justifications for focusing upon equilibrium are more pragmatic. The analysis of a model must begin somewhere, and the equilibrium is a natural starting point. Alternatively, the focus can be justified by showing that the equilibrium is the outcome of playing the underlying game correctly. In addition, even if the final focus is on disequilibrium, there is benefit from comparing the properties of points of disequilibrium to those of the equilibrium. Finally, no positions other than those of equilibrium have any obvious claim to prominence.
