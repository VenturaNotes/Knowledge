- $n$. a gene in viruses ($v$-onc) and mammalian cells ($c$-onc) that can cause cancer. It results from the mutation of a normal gene (a protooncogene). An oncogene is capable of both initiation and continuation of malignant transformation of normal cells. It probably produces proteins (growth factors) regulating cell division that, under certain conditions, become uncontrolled and may transform a normal cell to a malignant state.
