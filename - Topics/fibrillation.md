- $n$. chaotic electrical and mechanical activity of a heart chamber, which results in loss of synchronous contraction. The affected part of the heart then ceases to pump blood.
- Fibrillation may affect the atria or ventricles independently. In atrial fibrillation (a common type of arrhythmia), the chaotic electrical activity of the atria is conducted to the ventricles in a random manner resulting in a rapid and irregular pulse rate. The main causes are atherosclerosis, chronic rheumatic heart disease, and hypertensive heart disease. It may also complicate various other conditions, including chest infections and thyroid overactivity. The heart rate is controlled by the administration of digoxin; in some cases the heart rhythm can be restored to normal by cardioversion. Anticoagulant therapy reduces the risk of blood-clot formation, which could cause a stroke.
- When ventricular fibrillation occurs the ventricles stop beating (see CARDIAC ARREST). It is most commonly the result of myocardial infarction.
