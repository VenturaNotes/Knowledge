- (PPH) excessive bleeding ($>500 \mathrm{~ml}$) from the genital tract after delivery. Primary PPH occurs within 24 hours of delivery; secondary PPH occurs after 24 hours. Major (or atonic) PPH, in which blood loss exceeds 1000 ml , is due to failure of the uterus to contract after delivery. It may be caused by retained products of conception or may occur after a long labor, trauma (e.g. from cervical or vaginal tears), or thrombin deficiency. An emergency hysterectomy may be required.
