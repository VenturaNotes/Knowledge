- In this mode, we have unidirectional communication meaning it's a one-way street. Out of the two connecting devices, only one is capable of transmission. The other one is only capable of receiving.
- The simplex mode can always utilize a channel's entire capacity for sending the data in a single direction
- Example
	- Traditional [[monitor|monitors]] and keyboards use the simplex transmission mode. In this case, the monitor can only generate the output, and the keyboard can only introduce an input in the system
