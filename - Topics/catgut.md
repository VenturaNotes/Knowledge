## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a natural fibrous material prepared from the tissues of animals, usually from the walls of sheep intestines, twisted into strands of different thicknesses and formerly widely used to sew up wounds (see SUTURE) and tie off blood vessels during surgery. The catgut gradually dissolves and is absorbed by the tissues, so that the stitches do not have to be removed later. Catgut has now been replaced by synthetic absorbable suture material, such as vicryl.
