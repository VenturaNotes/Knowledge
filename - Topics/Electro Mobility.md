- Electro mobility, or e-Mobility, is the practice of using environmentally-friendly forms of transportation that are powered by electricity instead of by gasoline. These vehicles include bikes, buses, trucks, vans and cars and may be fully or partially electrically operated. Those that are only partially operated using electricity are known as hybrid vehicles.
