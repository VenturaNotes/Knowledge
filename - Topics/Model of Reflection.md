- A model of reflection is a structured framework that business professionals can use to guide the process of self-reflection. This process aims to emphasize the exploration and examination of one's previous thoughts, perspectives, experiences, and actions to be a better version of themselves in the future.
- Various models of reflection can be used to understand and learn from past situations, such as the CARL Model of Reflection, the Gibbs Reflective Cycle, the Atkins and Murphy Model, John’s Model of Structured Reflection, and Boud’s Triangular Representation, among others. The models of reflection can help business professionals to view circumstances with a broader lens.
