- One way of mapping the elements of a two-dimensional array onto a vector. If a two-dimensional array, $A$, with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is mapped in row-major order onto a vector $b$ with $m n$ elements then$$\begin{aligned}& a_{ij}=b_{k} \\& \text {where } k=n(i-1)+j\end{aligned}$$See also COLUMN-MAJOR ORDER.
