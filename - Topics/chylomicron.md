## Source [^1]
- $n$. a lipoprotein particle present in the blood after digested fat has been absorbed from the small intestine. The lipid portion consists largely of triglycerides, which are released by the action of lipoprotein lipase.
## Source[^2]
- Any of the lipoprotein particles synthesized by intestinal epithelial cells. They consist mainly of triglycerides, in combination with cholesterol and phospholipids, all inside a protein coat to make them water soluble. They pass from the epithelium into the lacteal of each villus, and thence via the lymphatic system to enter the bloodstream via the thoracic duct. Hence, chylomicrons are the form in which dietary fat is transported in the circulatory system.
