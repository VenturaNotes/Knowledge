- Mobile data is information received by a mobile device, such as a smartphone via a wireless cellular connection. Mobile data allows mobile device users to connect to the internet using their mobile device instead of having to connect to Wi-Fi. Most businesses that provide their employees with smartphones, tablets, and other mobile devices equip those devices with mobile data. This allows employees to access social networking platforms, use video chatting platforms, check their email, stream videos, use navigational tools, and browse the web while on the go.
