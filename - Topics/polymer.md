- $n$. a substance formed by the linkage of a large number of smaller molecules known as monomers. An example of a monomer is glucose, whose molecules link together to form glycogen, a polymer. Polymers may have molecular weights from a few thousands to many millions. Polymers made up of a single type of monomer are known as homopolymers; those of two or more monomers as heteropolymers.
## Source[^2]
- A substance having large molecules consisting of repeated units (the monomers). There are a number of natural polymers, such as polysaccharides.
