- $n$. Avoidance of food with a distinctive taste by an organism that has felt ill after eating food with that taste, the aversion often being learned after a single trial, even if the ill feeling arises many hours after eating the food and is not caused by the food. In the original experiment carried out by the US psychologists Sam Revusky (born 1933) and John Garcia (1917-2012) and published in 1970, rats were fed a sweettasting sucrose solution and were then injected with lithium chloride, which made them mildly ill, and they refused to touch the sucrose solution the next day. Also called conditioned food/taste aversion, flavour aversion learning/conditioning, food aversion conditioning, food avoidance learning/conditioning, Garcia effect, learned flavour aversion, learned taste aversion, taste aversion learning/conditioning, toxicosis.
