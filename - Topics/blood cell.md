The cells may be subclassified into three major categories, namely red cells (erythrocytes); white cells (leucocytes), which include granulocytes, lymphocytes, and monocytes; and platelets (see illustration). The blood cells account for approximately $40 \%$ of the total volume of the blood in health; red cells comprise the vast majority.
