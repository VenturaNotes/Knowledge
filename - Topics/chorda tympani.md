- $n$. One of the branches of the facial nerve, running through the cavity of the middle ear, supplying efferent impulses to two of the salivary glands and receiving afferent impulses from the anterior (front) two-thirds of the tongue, responsible for all of the sweet and some of the sour and salty taste sensations. In spite of its name, it is not involved in hearing. \[From Latin chorda a string + tympanum a drum, so called because it crosses the eardrum in the middle ear]
