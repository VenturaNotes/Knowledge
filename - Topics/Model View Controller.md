- A model view controller (MVC) is an application design model that separates the graphical user interface (GUI) displayed to an application user from the code that manages user input. An MVC is made up of three interconnected components: data, the user interface, and the controller that processes user input. MVCs provide software developers with the fundamental elements needed to design desktop and mobile programs, as well as web applications.
