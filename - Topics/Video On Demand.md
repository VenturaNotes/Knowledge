It can include feature films or television episodes (both new and old), sporting events or concerts airing live or in a condensed or edited format, or even user-created video content such as video podcasts or video blogs. Pricing for VOD can be pay-per-view (with 24- to 48-hour viewing windows) or monthly subscription plans that offer unlimited viewing access either with or without ads.
