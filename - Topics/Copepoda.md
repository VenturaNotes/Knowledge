- A class of crustaceans occurring in marine and freshwater habitats. Copepods are usually $0.5\text{-}2 \mathrm{~mm}$ long and lack both a carapace and compound eyes. Copepods are important members of plankton: some are free-living, feeding on microscopic organisms; others are parasitic. A familiar freshwater genus is Cyclops, so named because the members have a single median eye.
