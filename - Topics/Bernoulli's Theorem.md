### Probability
- The relative frequency of an event happening is $m / n$ where $m$ is the number of occurrences in $n$ trials. If $p$ is the probability of the event, then the relative frequency tends towards the probability as the sample size increases to infinity. Precisely, the theorem states that for any $\varepsilon>0, \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty} \operatorname{Pr}\left\{\left|\frac{m}{n}-p\right|<\varepsilon\right\}=1$.
- This is a special case of the weak law of large numbers.

### Fluid Dynamics
- In an inviscid, incompressible, irrotational fluid flow,$$H=\frac{p}{\rho}+\frac{1}{2}|\mathbf{u}|^{2}+g z$$is constant along streamlines. Here $p$ denotes pressure, $\rho$ denotes density, $\mathbf{u}$ is the flow velocity, and $g$ denotes gravity. If, further, the flow is steady, then $H$ is constant throughout the flow.
