- A person who buys things, usually for money. In their role as a consumer everybody is a buyer, but firms employ specialist buyers. In the case of goods which vary in quality, design, or specification, or where suppliers are difficult to track down, a buyer is a highly skilled expert whose services are vital to the firm.

- (1) A person who makes a purchase of a product or service. Quite often, this person will be different from both the 'influencer' of the buying decision and the 'user' of the product or service (see CONSUMER BUYING BEHAVIOR). For example, a mother may$\textemdash$on the advice of a friend$\textemdash$make a purchase, which is consumed by her child. 
- (2) A person in an organization's buying centre (or decision-making unit) with formal authority to select the supplier and arrange the terms of purchase. See BUSINESS BUYER BEHAVIOR.
