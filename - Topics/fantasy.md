- $n$. a complex sequence of imagination in which several imaginary elements are woven together into a story. An excessive preoccupation with one's fantasies may be symptomatic of a difficulty in coping with reality or part of a narcissistic personality disorder (see NARCISSISM). In psychoanalytic psychology, unconscious fantasies are believed to control behavior, and psychological symptoms may be symbols of or defences against such fantasies (see SYMBOLISM).
