- These are values or variables on which an operator acts
- In expressions, they are the components manipulated by [[operator|operators]]
- In arithmetic operations, the number being added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided are the operands
- Operands can be [[literal]] (like numbers), variables, or more complex expressions
### Example
```python
print(5 / 2) #5 and 2 are operands and / is the operator
print(8 + 4) #8 and 4 are operands
print(3 * 5) #3 and 5 are operands

```
