- Benchmarking is defined as the measurement of business practices and metrics and comparing them to other companies, departments, etc. to understand where a company needs to make changes. Benchmarking has four main categories: internal, external, practice and performance. In short, benchmarks allow a company to grade itself on its performance. They can reveal what departments or processes are keeping up with or lagging behind other companies.
