## Synthesis
- In the inner ear, the cochlea converts sound vibrations into neural signals which travel along the auditory nerve to the brainstem
- The sound is then localized by the trapezoid body and superior olivary complex by processing differences in sound intensity and timing. 
- The inferior colliculus then receives this information from the lower brainstem which is relayed to the MGN in the thalamus.
- It's then forwarded to the primary auditory cortex for further analyis where sound qualities are perceived and interpreted

1. Sound waves are collected by the outer ear and funneled through the ear canal to the eardrum (tympanic membrane).
2. The vibrations of the eardrum are transmitted to the middle ear, where they cause the ossicles (malleus, incus, stapes) to amplify and transmit the sound waves to the inner ear.
3. In the inner ear, the cochlea converts the vibrations into neural signals that travel along the auditory nerve to the brainstem.
4. In the brainstem, the trapezoid body and superior olivary complex help in localizing the source of the sound by processing differences in sound intensity and timing between the ears.
5. The inferior colliculus in the midbrain receives and processes auditory information from lower brainstem nuclei.
6. From the inferior colliculus, auditory signals are relayed to the medial geniculate nucleus (MGN) in the thalamus.
7. The MGN then forwards the processed auditory information to the primary auditory cortex in the temporal lobe for further analysis, where sound qualities like pitch, intensity, and location are perceived and interpreted.
