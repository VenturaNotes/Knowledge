- A program that obtains input from a user by displaying a list of options-the menu-from which the user indicates his/her choice. Systems running menu-driven programs are commonplace, ranging from microprocessor controlled washing machines to bank cash dispensers. In the case of the cash dispenser, single keys are pressed to indicate the type of transaction (whether a receipt is wanted with the cash, or if a statement of the bank balance is required) and with many, a single key is pressed to indicate the amount of money required.
- Menu-driven systems are advantageous in two ways: firstly, because input is via single key strokes, the system is less prone to user error; secondly, because only a limited range of characters are 'allowed', the way in which the input is to be entered is unambiguous. This contributes toward making the system more user-friendly. Compare COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE.
