- $n$. bleeding within a joint, which may follow injury or may occur spontaneously in bleeding disorders, such as haemophilia. It is usually associated with swelling, warmth, and pain in the affected joint. Treatment includes immobilization, pressure bandaging, and correction of the blood disorder (if present). Aspiration of blood from a joint that is tensely swollen may relieve the pain.
