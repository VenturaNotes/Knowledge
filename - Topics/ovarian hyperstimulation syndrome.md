- a potentially life-threatening condition classically associated with ovarian stimulation using gonadotrophins in assisted conception procedures, such as in vitro fertilization (see SUPEROVULATION). It is characterized by gross enlargement of the ovaries resulting in pain, bloating, nausea, vomiting, haemoconcentration, and ascites. The most severe cases require intensive care due to the high risk of thromboembolism and acute respiratory distress.
