- a disease of domesticated pigs, first seen in humans in early 2009, caused by H1N1, a strain of influenza A virus. Very contagious, the World Health Organization has now declared it to be a pandemic strain in humans. Swine influenza is currently believed not to be as virulent as avian influenza and it seems to be less severe than the virulent 1918 pandemic, with which it shares antigenic features.
