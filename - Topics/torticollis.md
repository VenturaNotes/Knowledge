- (wryneck) $n$. an irresistible turning movement of the head that becomes more persistent, so that eventually the head is held continually to one side. This is a form of dystonia; the spasm of the muscles is often painful. It may be caused by a birth injury to the sternomastoid muscle (see STERNOMASTOID TUMOR). Relief may be obtained by cutting the motor nerve roots of the spinal nerves in the neck region or by injection of the affected muscles with botulinum toxin.
