- $n$. inflammation of the urinary bladder, often caused by infection (most commonly by the bacterium Escherichia coli). It is usually accompanied by the desire to pass urine frequently, with a degree of burning. More severe attacks are often associated with the painful passage of blood in the urine, which is accompanied by a cramplike pain in the lower abdomen persisting after the bladder has been emptied. An acute attack is treated by antibiotic administration and a copious fluid intake. See also INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS.
