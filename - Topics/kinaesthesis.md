- $n$. The sensation that is stimulated by movements of the body or parts of the body and is mediated by proprioceptors in the vestibular system and in the muscles, tendons, and joints. The term is sometimes used as a synonym for proprioception, thus including sensations of position and orientation rather than just movement, but this ignores the etymology of the word and sacrifices a useful distinction, and the over-extended sense is therefore avoided in careful usage. US kinesthesis. Also called kinaesthesia or kinesthesia. See joint sense, muscle sense, static sense, tendon sense. kinaesthetic or kinesthetic adj. \[From Greek kineein to move + aisthesis sensation, from aisthanesthai to feel]
