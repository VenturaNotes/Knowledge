- $n$. a condition in which the blood changes from a liquid to a solid state within the cardiovascular system during life and produces a mass of coagulated blood (thrombus). Thrombosis may occur within a blood vessel in diseased states. Thrombosis in an artery obstructs the blood flow to the tissue it supplies: obstruction of an artery to the brain is one of the causes of a stroke and thrombosis in an artery supplying the heart coronary thrombosis $\textendash$ results in a heart attack (see MYOCARDIAL INFARCTION). Thrombosis can also occur in a vein (deep vein thrombosis; see PHLEBOTHROMBOSIS), and it may be associated with inflammation (see THROMBOPHLEBITIS). The thrombus may become detached from its site of formation and carried in the blood to lodge in another part (see EMBOLISM).
