## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A single-stranded DNA molecule that can bind to a complementary base sequence in a particular messenger RNA (mRNA) molecule and so prevent synthesis of the protein encoded by the mRNA. Although antisense DNA thus has the potential to block the expression of a particular gene, this is achieved more effectively by short double-stranded RNA molecules (see RNA INTERFERENCE), which are not susceptible to degradation by DNase enzymes. See also ANTISENSE RNA.
