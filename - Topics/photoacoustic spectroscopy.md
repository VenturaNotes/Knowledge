## Source [^1]
- A spectroscopic technique in which spectra of opaque materials, such as powders, are obtained by exposing the material to light that is modulated at acoustic frequencies. This produces a photoacoustic signal, the magnitude of which can be related to the ultraviolet or infrared absorption coefficient of the material. See also optoacoustic spectroscopy.
