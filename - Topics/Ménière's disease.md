- a disease of the inner ear characterized by episodes of deafness, buzzing in the ears (tinnitus), and vertigo. Typically the attacks are preceded by a sensation of fullness in the ear. Symptoms last for several hours and between attacks the affected ear may return to normal, although hearing does tend to deteriorate gradually with repeated attacks. It is thought to be caused by the build-up of fluid in the inner ear. Drug treatments include prochlorperazine to reduce vertigo in acute attacks and betahistine as prophylactic treatment. Transtympanic injections of steroids into the middle ear are sometimes utilized. Alternatively, ototoxic drugs, such as gentamicin, can be injected through the eardrum into the middle ear to deliberately damage the vestibular apparatus and hence reduce activity in the inner ear. Surgical procedures used include decompression or drainage of the endolymphatic sac, vestibular nerve section, and labyrinthectomy. Medical name: endolymphatic hydrops. \[P. Ménière (1799-1862), French physician]
