- $n$. A proposition about various shifts that occurred in the pronunciation of plosive consonants between the Proto-Indo-European language and the various Indo-European languages, including English, that are descended from it, based on a set of nine correspondences observed between Sanskrit, Latin and Greek on the one hand and the Germanic languages such as English on the other, including the change from \[p] to \[f] as in Latin pater becoming English father and the change from \[t] to \[ $\theta$] as in Latin tres becoming English three. The other correspondences are \[k] to \[x] (the final phoneme in the Scots loch), \[b] to \[p], \[d] to \[t], \[g] to \[k], $[b^h]$ (aspirated, that is, accompanied by a brief \[h]-sound) to \[b], $[d^h]$to \[d], and $[g^h]$ to \[g]. See also Grassmann's law (linguistics). \[Named after the German philologist Jakob Ludwig Karl Grimm (1785-1863) who formulated it in 1822]
