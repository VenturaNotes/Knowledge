## Source [^1]
- A type of PROM that is capable of being programmed a number of times by the user. The contents of EPROMs are generally erased (i.e. reset to their nonprogrammed state, usually logic 1) by exposure to hard ultraviolet radiation. The EPROM may then be reprogrammed, i.e. selected elements set to logic 0 , using a PROM programmer. See also EEPROM.
