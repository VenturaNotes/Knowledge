- Having an affinity for water. Some hydrophilic substances, e.g. sodium chloride, consist of ions that dissolve in water to form a homogeneous mixture called a solution. However, other nonionic substances, such as a sugar cube, also dissolve in water due to the presence of ionic and polar regions on their surface.
