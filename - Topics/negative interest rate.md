- A charge levied by a central bank on deposits by commercial banks, sometimes only for balances in excess of a certain amount. A negative interest rate has been used by the national central banks of Denmark (since 2012), Japan (2016), Sweden (2009), Switzerland (2014), and the European Central Bank (2014). Central banks use a negative interest rate to prevent currency appreciation or to counter low inflation or deflation.
