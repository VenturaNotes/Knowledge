- A legal contract in which an insurer promises to pay a specified amount to another party, the insured, if a particular event (known as the peril), happens and the insured suffers a financial loss as a result. The insured's part of the contract is to promise to pay an amount of money, known as the premium, either once or at regular intervals. In order for an insurance contract to be valid, the insured must have an insurable interest. It is usual to use the word 'insurance' to cover events (such as a fire) that may or may not happen, whereas assurance refers to an event (such as death) that must occur at some time (see also LIFE ASSURANCE). The main branches of insurance are: accident insurance, fire insurance, holiday and travel insurance, household insurance, liability insurance, livestock and bloodstock insurance, loss-of-profit insurance (see BUSINESS-INTERRUPTION POLICY), marine insurance, motor insurance, pluvial insurance, private health insurance, and property insurance. See also REINSURANCE.
