- The name in which a UK company is registered. The name, without which a company cannot be incorporated, will be stated in the company's constitutional documents. Some names are prohibited by law and will not be registered; these include names already registered and names that in the opinion of the Secretary of State are offensive. The name may be changed by special resolution of the company and the Secretary of State may order a company to change a misleading name. The name must be displayed at each place of business, on stationery and e-mails, and on bills of exchange, etc., or the company and its officers will be liable to a fine.
