- a procedure in which a narrowed segment of coronary artery is stretched (dilated) by the inflation of a balloon introduced into it by means of cardiac catheterization under X-ray screening (see ANGIOPLASTY). In most cases a stent is then implanted into the angioplastied segment as this improves duration.
