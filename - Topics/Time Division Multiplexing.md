- Time-division multiplexing (TDM) is a communications technique that transmits two or more low-speed signals into a single high-speed transmission channel. It does this by breaking low-speed signals into different segments and combining them for transmission. TDM optimizes bandwidth by allowing multiple low-speed signals to be transmitted simultaneously, improving traffic volumes in communication networks.
