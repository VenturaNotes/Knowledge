- Log4j is an aspect of the Apache Logging Services Project. Log4j is one of the most widely deployed open source software solutions, as it provides logging capabilities for Java applications. Log4j is most commonly deployed as a Java service or as a software library within a program.
- In late 2021, Log4jâ€™s remote code execution (RCE) CVE-2021-44228 was found to be vulnerable to cyberattacks. This RCE flaw occurred because Log4j interacts with the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) without properly validating all requests. In other words: cyberattackers who spot the RCE flaw are able to gain access to logging messages and launch malicious code on the system to exploit the vulnerability, gaining access to the private information of many users.
- Most software vendors whose products use Log4j have not fixed this system vulnerability, leaving users susceptible to cyberattackers.
