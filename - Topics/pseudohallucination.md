- $n$. a controversial term, commonly used in mental state examinations, for an experience described by the patient as a hallucination but judged by the psychiatrist as not perceived as such by the patient. It may sometimes be seen as an attempt by patients to pretend that they suffer from genuine hallucinations. The term is generally unhelpful because it implies a value judgment.
