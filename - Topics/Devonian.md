- A geological period in the Palaeozoic era that extended from the end of the Silurian (about 419 million years ago) to the beginning of the Carboniferous (about 359 mya). It was named by Adam Sedgwick (1785-1873) and Roderick Murchison (1792-1871) in 1839. The Devonian is divided into seven stages based on invertebrate fossil remains, such as corals, brachiopods, ammonoids, and crinoids, found in marine deposits. There were also extensive continental deposits consisting of conglomerates, red silts, and sandstones, forming the Old Red Sandstone facies. Fossils in the Old Red Sandstone include fishes and the earliest land plants (see RHYNIOPHYTES; TRIMEROPHYTES; ZOSTEROPHYLLOPHYTES). Graptolites became extinct early in the Devonian and the trilobites declined.
