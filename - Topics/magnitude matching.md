- $n$. An application of cross-modal matching in psychophysics designed to take account of different people's sensory sensitivity in a particular modality by comparing it with a sensation in a different modality. For example, groups of normal tasters and supertasters typically rate Coca-Cola slightly above the midpoint on a scale from zero to maximum sweetness, inviting the misleading interpretation that their taste sensations are similar. If both groups are then asked to match the taste sensation to the loudness of a tone, normal tasters typically choose a loudness of about 80 decibels, whereas supertasters choose about 90-100 decibels (twice to three times as loud), indicating that supertasters experience double to triple the sweetness of normal tasters.
