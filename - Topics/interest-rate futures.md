- A form of financial futures that enables investors, portfolio managers, borrowers, etc., to obtain protection against future movements in interest rates. Interest-rate futures also enable dealers to speculate on these movements. In the UK, interest-rate futures are dealt in on London's LIFFE exchange (now part of ICE Futures Europe), using contracts for three-month sterling, eurodollars, euros, etc., in the short term and long gilts, US Treasury bonds, euro bonds, etc., in the long term. For long gilts, for example, the standard contract is for $Â£ 50,000$ of nominal value and the tick size is $0.01 \%$ of the nominal value. See HEDGE.

- A form of financial futures where the pay-off from the contract is determined by an interest rate. These futures can be used either to hedge, that is to reduce risks, or to speculate, accepting extra risks for the sake of expected profits. Interest-rate futures are traded in the UK on the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange.
