- Deposits that the UK government may instruct the clearing banks to make at the Bank of England, as a means of restricting credit in the economy. The less money the clearing banks have at their disposal, the less they are able to lend to businesses. A similar system has been used by the Federal Reserve System in the USA.

- Additional deposits that other banks are required to make with the central bank. These may carry low or no interest, and do not count towards any normal minimum reserve requirements. Special deposits reduce bank profits, and their ability to extend credit.
