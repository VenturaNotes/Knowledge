- (DORV) a congenital defect of the heart in which both the aorta and the pulmonary artery arise predominantly from the right ventricle anterior to the ventricular septum with an associated ventricular septal defect (VSD). The relationship between the site of the VSD and the great arteries must be taken into account for surgical repair. DORV can be associated with chromosomal defects.
