- $n$. the process of red blood cell (erythrocyte) production, which normally occurs in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow. The ultimate precursor of the red cell is the haemopoietic stem cell, but the earliest precursor that can be identified microscopically is the proerythroblast. This divides and passes through a series of stages of maturation termed respectively early, intermediate, and late normoblasts, the latter finally losing its nucleus to become a mature red cell. See also HAEMOPOIESIS.
