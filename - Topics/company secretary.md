- An officer of a company. The appointment is usually made by the directors. The secretary's duties are mainly administrative, including preparation of the agenda for directors' meetings. However, the modern company secretary has an increasingly important role, which may include managing the office and entering into contracts on behalf of the company. Duties imposed by law include the submission of the annual return and the keeping of minutes. The secretary of a public company is required to have certain qualifications, as set out in the Companies Acts. Under the Companies Act 2006 a private company is no longer required to appoint a company secretary. See Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators.
