- (fuzzy theory) A branch of logic designed specifically for representing knowledge and human reasoning in such a way that it is amenable to processing by computer. Thus fuzzy logic is applicable to expert systems, knowledge engineering, and artificial intelligence.
- The more traditional propositional and predicate logics do not allow for degrees of imprecision, indicated by words or phrases such as fairly, very, quite possibly. Instead of truth values such as true and false it is possible to introduce a multivalued logic consisting of, for example, the values true, not true, very true, not very true, more or less true, not very false, very false, not false, and false. Alternatively an interval such as \[0,1\] can be introduced and the degree of truth can be represented by some real number in this range. Predicates are then functions that map not into \{true, false\} but into these more general domains.
- Fuzzy logic is concerned with the study of sets and predicates of this kind. There emerge such concepts as fuzzy sets, fuzzy relationships, and fuzzy quantifiers.
## Source[^2]
- Fuzzy logic in various disciplines such as engineering or computing is a model used to deal with approximate or imprecise information. For instance, artificial intelligence strives to mimic the way humans think, which is non-binary. Most reasoning is not a yes or no proposition. It is based on several variables, including human preferences.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A form of logic based on fuzzy set theory in which propositions (1) have continuously graded truth values ranging from 0 to 1 , rather than being either false ( 0 ) or true (1) as in conventional Boolean logic. It is influential mainly in the field of knowledge representation and neural networks.
