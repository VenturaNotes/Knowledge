- analysis of a specimen of semen, which should be obtained after five days of abstinence from coitus, in order to assess male fertility. Normal values are as follows: volume of ejaculate: 2-6.5 ml; liquefaction complete in 30 minutes; sperm concentration: 20-200 million spermatozoa per ml (sperm count refers to the total number of spermatozoa in the ejaculate); motility: $60 \%$ moving progressively at 30 minutes to 3 hours; abnormal forms: less than 20%. Analysis of three separate specimens is necessary before confirming the presence of an abnormal result.
