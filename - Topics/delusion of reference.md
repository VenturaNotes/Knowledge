## Source [^1]
- a delusion in which the patient believes that unsuspicious occurrences refer to him or her in person. Patients may, for example, believe that certain news bulletins have a direct reference to them, that music played on the radio is played for them, or that car licence plates have a meaning relevant to them. Ideas of reference differ from delusions of reference in that insight is retained.
