- Tailgating, commonly referred to as piggybacking, is a common way for hackers and other unauthorized personnel to gain access to restricted company areas. Tailgating is a type of physical security break that occurs when an unauthorized person simply follows a company employee into a restricted area of a business. Companies with multiple entrance points are quite vulnerable to these types of attacks, as the more ways there are to enter a building, the more locations there are to monitor and secure. To mitigate the threat of tailgating, corporations often encourage their staff to use RFID smart cards, retina scanners, or other forms of access control devices to ensure that only authorized personnel enter restricted areas of a workplace.
