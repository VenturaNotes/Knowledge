- An equilibrium of a dynamical system is Lyapunov stable if any suitably small perturbation from the equilibrium results in the system staying near the equilibrium forever. More precisely, given a metric $d$ on the phase space, an equilibrium $e$ is Lyapunov stable if for all $\upvarepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ so that if $d(x(0), e) < \delta$, then $d(x(t), e) < \upvarepsilon$ for all $t$, where $x(t)$ denotes the evolution of the system following the perturbation. further, the equilibrium is said to be asymptotically stable if $x(t) \to e$ as $t \to \infty$ if $d(x(0), e) < \delta$.
