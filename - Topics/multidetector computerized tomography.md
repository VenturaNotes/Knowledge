- (MDCT) a development of spiral CT scanning that uses more than one array of detectors opposite the X-ray tube, so that more tissue can be included, with thinner cuts, in a single rotation of the machine. This is particularly important for threedimensional reconstruction of tissues. It also allows volumetric scanning or isotropic imaging, which are best achieved when the thickness of the slice is similar to the size resolution of the detectors in the other two planes. Modern CT scanners are now usually equipped with between 16 and 640 detector arrays. The technique is particularly valuable for imaging fastmoving structures, such as the heart.
