- (haematocrit) the volume of the red cells (erythrocytes) in blood, expressed as a fraction of the total volume of the blood. The packed cell volume is determined by centrifuging blood in a tube and measuring the height of the red-cell column as a fraction of the total. Automated instruments calculate packed cell volume as the product of the erythrocyte count and the measured mean red cell volume (mean corpuscular volume; MCV).
