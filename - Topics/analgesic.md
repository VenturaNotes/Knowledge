- (1) n. a drug that relieves pain. Nonopioid analgesics, such as aspirin and paracetamol, are used for the relief of headache, toothache, and mild rheumatic pain. More potent opioid analgesics, such as morphine, pethidine, alfentanil, and buprenorphine, are used to relieve moderate or severe pain; these drugs may produce dependence and tolerance (see OPIATE). Some analgesics, including aspirin and indometacin, also reduce fever and inflammation and are used in rheumatic and other inflammatory conditions (see NSAID). 
- (2) adj. relieving pain.
## Source[^2]
- A substance that reduces pain without causing unconsciousness, either by reducing the pain threshold or by increasing pain tolerance. There are several categories of analgesic drugs, including morphine and its derivatives (see OPIATE), which produce analgesia by acting on the central nervous system; nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (e.g. aspirin); and local anaesthetics.
