- (1) n. a drug that relieves pain. Nonopioid analgesics, such as aspirin and paracetamol, are used for the relief of headache, toothache, and mild rheumatic pain. More potent opioid analgesics, such as morphine, pethidine, alfentanil, and buprenorphine, are used to relieve moderate or severe pain; these drugs may produce dependence and tolerance (see OPIATE). Some analgesics, including aspirin and indometacin, also reduce fever and inflammation and are used in rheumatic and other inflammatory conditions (see NSAID). 
- (2) adj. relieving pain.
