- The distribution of the number of occurrences of a random event as the result of making a number of independent draws, with a known and constant probability of the event occurring each time. If the probability of the event (for example 'heads' throwing a coin, or ' 6 ' throwing a die) each time is $p$, and the probability of non-occurrence is ( $1-$ $p$ ), the binomial distribution gives the probability of exactly $r$ occurrences in $n$ independent tries, where the $r$ satisfies $0 \leq r \leq n$. This probability is given by$$p^{r}(1-p)^{n-r}{ }_{n} C_{r}$$${ }_{n} C_{r}$ denotes the number of ways of choosing $r$ objects out of $n$ and is called the binomial coefficient$${ }_{n} C_{r}=n!/[r!(n-r)!]$$where $r$ ! denotes ' $r$ factorial', defined as $0!=1$ and for $r>0$$$r!=r(r-1)(r-2) \ldots(2)(1)$$
