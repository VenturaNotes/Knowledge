- The distribution of the number of occurrences of a random event as the result of making a number of independent draws, with a known and constant probability of the event occurring each time. If the probability of the event (for example 'heads' throwing a coin, or ' 6 ' throwing a die) each time is $p$, and the probability of non-occurrence is ( $1-$ $p$ ), the binomial distribution gives the probability of exactly $r$ occurrences in $n$ independent tries, where the $r$ satisfies $0 \leq r \leq n$. This probability is given by$$p^{r}(1-p)^{n-r}{ }_{n} C_{r}$$${ }_{n} C_{r}$ denotes the number of ways of choosing $r$ objects out of $n$ and is called the binomial coefficient$${ }_{n} C_{r}=n!/[r!(n-r)!]$$where $r$ ! denotes ' $r$ factorial', defined as $0!=1$ and for $r>0$$$r!=r(r-1)(r-2) \ldots(2)(1)$$

- The basic discrete probability distribution for data in the form of proportions. An event, E, can occur with probability $p$. In a sample of $n$ independent trials the probability that E occurs exactly $r$ times is$${ }^{n} \mathrm{C}_{\mathrm{r}} \mathrm{p}^{r}(1-p)^{n-r}$$(see COMBINATION). The distribution is discrete, taking only the values $0,1,2, \ldots, n$. The mean of the binomial distribution is $n p$ and the variance is$$n p /(1-p)$$
## Source[^3]
- The discrete probability distribution for the number of successes when $n$ independent Bernoulli trials are carried out, each with the same probability $p$ of success. The probability mass function is given by $\operatorname{Pr}(X=r)={ }^{n} C_{r} p^{r}(1-p)^{n-r}$, for $0 \leq r$ $\leq n$. This distribution is denoted $\mathrm{B}(n, p)$ and has mean $n p$ and variance $n p(1-p)$.
