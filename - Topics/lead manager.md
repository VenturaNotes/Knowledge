- (lead bank) A bank or other financial institution chosen to underwrite a new issue of bonds or to head a syndicated bank facility. It is usually chosen either because it has a close relationship with the borrower or because it has been successful in a competitive bought deal contest. The lead manager is the main organizer of the transactions and takes a larger fee than the other institutions involved.
