- A financial scheme in which investors are offered a high rate of return, but this is paid out of investments made by a large number of newly joined members, attracted by these high rates, rather than from real production or investment activities. Such schemes are inherently fraudulent; they can pay the promised return only as long as total membership rises fast enough, and once new entry slows down or falls they are bound to default on their promises.
