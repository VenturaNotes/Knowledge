- (CT) a form of X-ray examination in which the X-ray source and detector (CT scanner) rotate around the object to be scanned and the information obtained can be used to produce cross-sectional images (see CROSS-SECTIONAL IMAGING) by computer (a CT scan). A higher radiation dose is received by the patient than with some conventional X-ray techniques, but the diagnostic information obtained is far greater and should outweigh the increased risk. CT scanning can be used for all parts of the body. The data obtained can be used to construct threedimensional images of structures of interest. See also MULTIDETECTOR COMPUTERIZED TOMOGRAPHY; SPIRAL CT SCANNING.
