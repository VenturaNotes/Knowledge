- (PC) A microcomputer suitable for a single user, with a localized hard storage disk and a microprocessor. Although microcomputers have limited abilities compared with the larger mainframes, they are sufficiently powerful to meet the needs of most small businesses; their uses include producing accounts and payrolls, invoicing, word processing, and compiling mailing lists. More powerful systems can be obtained by linking several small computers by a local area network. See also LAPTOP COMPUTER; TABLET COMPUTER.
