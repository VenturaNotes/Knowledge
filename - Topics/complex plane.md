## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Provides a graphical representation of complex numbers and facilitates operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of complex numbers

### Key Points
- [[Coordinate Plane|coordinate system]]
	- The complex plane is a 2-dimensional coordinate system where each point corresponds to a complex number.
	- Horizontal axis represents real part ($\Re$) and vertical axis represents imaginary part $\Im$ 
- [[Origin]]
	- Where real and imaginary axes intersect (0 + 0i or 0)
- Representation
	- a + bi
- Has Quadrants I to IV
- Distance from origin
	- Distance of a point (representing a complex number) from the origin is called its modulus or [[absolute value]]. It is calculated using the formula $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$. a is the real part and b is the imaginary part
- Polar form
- Operations

## Source[^2]
- The Cartesian plane is called the complex plane or Argand diagram when each point $(x, y)$ represents the complex number $x+y i$.
