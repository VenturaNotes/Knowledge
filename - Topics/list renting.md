- The practice of renting a list of potential customers to an organization involved in direct-mail selling or to a charity raising funds. When the terms of hiring restrict the use of the list to one mail shot, it is usual for the owner of the list to carry out the mailing, so that the hirer cannot copy it for subsequent use.
