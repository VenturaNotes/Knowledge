## Source[^2]
- (CPI) 
- (1) In the UK, the usual name for the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP), a measure of price level introduced in 1997 to enable comparisons within the EU. In the UK government inflation targets are now based on the CPI rather than the Retail Price Index. 
- (2) In the USA, the measure of price level calculated monthly by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is commonly known as the cost-of-living index and gives the cost of specific consumer items compared to the base year of 1967. Since 2000 the Federal Reserve Board has preferred to base its inflation forecasts on the Personal Consumption Expenditure Price Index (PCEPI), which is regarded as a more sophisticated measure.
