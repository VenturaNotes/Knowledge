- Produces hormones which controls
	- Body temperature
	- Heart rate
	- Hunger
	- Mood
	- Release of hormones from many glands, especially the pituitary gland
	- Sex drive
	- Sleep
	- Thirst

- Olfactory system
	- Located at the base of the thalamus
	- Vital control center for many bodily functions and indirectly influences our perception of smell through its connection to the hormonal system
	- Function primarily related to the regulation of physiological and behavioral responses to olfactory stimuli
- Memory System
	- Primary functions related to autonomic and endocrine control, emotional regulation, and homeostasis. It indirectly influences arousal, attention, stress response, sleep-wake cycles, motivation, and reward processing which can impact aspects of memory formation, consolidation and retrieval
	- Adequate sleep is critical for memory consolidation and retention. Disruptions in sleep patterns can impact memory processes

- $n$. the region of the forebrain in the floor of the third ventricle, linked with the thalamus above and the pituitary gland below (see BRAIN). It contains several important centres controlling body temperature, thirst, hunger, and eating, water balance, and sexual function. It is also closely connected with emotional activity and sleep and functions as a centre for the integration of hormonal and autonomic nervous activity through its control of the pituitary secretions (see NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM; PITUITARY GLAND). â€”hypothalamic adj.
