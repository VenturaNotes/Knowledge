## Synthesis
- Olfactory system
	- Located at the base of the thalamus
	- Vital control center for many bodily functions and indirectly influences our perception of smell through its connection to the hormonal system
	- Function primarily related to the regulation of physiological and behavioral responses to olfactory stimuli
- Memory System
	- Primary functions related to autonomic and endocrine control, emotional regulation, and homeostasis. It indirectly influences arousal, attention, stress response, sleep-wake cycles, motivation, and reward processing which can impact aspects of memory formation, consolidation and retrieval
	- Adequate sleep is critical for memory consolidation and retention. Disruptions in sleep patterns can impact memory processes

	- Body temperature
	- Heart rate
	- Hunger
	- Mood
	- Release of hormones from many glands, especially the pituitary gland
	- Sex drive
	- Sleep
	- Thirst

- $n$. the region of the forebrain in the floor of the third ventricle, linked with the thalamus above and the pituitary gland below (see BRAIN). It contains several important centers controlling body temperature, thirst, hunger, and eating, water balance, and sexual function. It is also closely connected with emotional activity and sleep and functions as a center for the integration of hormonal and autonomic nervous activity through its control of the pituitary secretions (see NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM; PITUITARY GLAND). â€”hypothalamic adj.

- (pl. hypothalami) Part of the vertebrate brain that is derived from the forebrain and located on the ventral surface below the thalamus and the cerebrum. The hypothalamus regulates a wide variety of physiological processes, including maintenance of body temperature (see THERMOREGULATION), the alarm response to stress, water balance, sleeping, feeding, lactation, and ovarian and uterine cycles, via both the autonomic nervous system (which it controls) and the neuroendocrine system. In mammals the central oscillator of the biological clock is located in the paired clusters of neurons known as the suprachiasmatic nuclei within the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus synthesizes the hormones oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone, which are transported to the posterior pituitary, from where they are released into the bloodstream. Indeed, the endocrine functions of the hypothalamus are largely mediated by the pituitary gland, to which it is connected by a short stalk. The pituitary responds to releasing hormones produced by the hypothalamus, which thereby indirectly controls hormone production in other glands.

- $n$. A fingernail-sized area of the diencephalon at the base of the brain in the limbic system, occupying the side walls and floor of the third ventricle, situated below both sides of the thalamus and above the pituitary gland, consisting of two halves with paired right and left nuclei, crucially involved in the regulation of the endocrine glands and the autonomic nervous system and implicated in the control of temperature, heart rate, blood pressure, hunger, thirst, sexual arousal, predatory aggression, and fight-or-flight responses. See arcuate nUCLEUS, lateral HYPOTHALAMIC FEEDING CENTER, MEDIAL FOREBRAIN BUNDLE, MEDIAN EMINENCE, OSMORECEPTOR (2), PARAVENTRICULAR NUCLEUS, PREOPTIC NUCLEUS, SATIETY CENTER, SUPRACHIASMATIC NUCLEUS, SUPRAOPTIC NUCLEUS, VENTROMEDIAL HYPOTHALAMUS, ZONA INCERTA. hypothalamic adj. \[From Greek hypo under + English thalamus, so called because of its situation]
