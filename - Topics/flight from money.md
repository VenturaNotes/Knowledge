- The tendency when inflation is very high for people to abandon the use of money, or at least that of their own country. Under hyperinflation people refuse to accept money, and try to spend any they receive as quickly as possible. They may substitute other goods, such as cigarettes, as a medium of exchange, revert to barter, or shift to foreign currency if sufficient is available.
