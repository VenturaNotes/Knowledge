## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- The topmost layer in the [[OSI model]] (Open Systems Interconnection model) of networking
- Primary role is to enable communication between applications running on different systems over a network
- This layer provides the interface that allows software to use network services
### Scope
- Focuses on how users interact with the network and the services provided by the network to applications
- Scope includes
	- End-User Interaction: 
		- Provides services and protocols that allow end-users or applications to access and interact with network resources
	- Protocol Management: 
		- Manages application-specific protocols for data exchange (e.g., [[HTTP]], [[FTP]], [[SMTP]], [[DNS]])
	- Network Transparency:
		- Hide complexities of lower layers (transport, network, etc.) from the user, making networking seamless
	- Data Formatting and Presentation
		- Ensures data is in a suitable format for communication between systems
### What it Does
- Provides Services to Applications
	- Enables software applications (web browsers, email clients, file-sharing tools) to use the network
	- A [[web browser]] uses the HTTP protocol at the application layer t
- Facilitates Communication
- Manages User Requests
- Data Presentation and Formatting
