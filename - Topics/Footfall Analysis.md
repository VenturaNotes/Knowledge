- Footfall analysis is a method for determining how many people are walking through or waiting in an area at any given time. It can monitor foot traffic patterns in busy locations such as shopping malls or airports, and help businesses make decisions about things like staffing levels during peak hours where the analysis has shown long queue wait times.
