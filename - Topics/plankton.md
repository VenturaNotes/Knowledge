- The collection of pelagic organisms that drift or float passively with the current in a sea or lake. Plankton includes many microscopic organisms, such as algae, protists, various animal larvae, and some worms, but also larger forms that are unable to swim effectively, such as jellyfish, krill, and copepods. Plankton forms an important food source for many other members of the aquatic community and is divided into zooplankton and phytoplankton. Compare BENTHOS; NEKTON; NEUSTON.
