- adj. describing or relating to the phenomena, such as cessation of breathing or change in the ECG or EEG, that are associated with the moment of death. For example, an agonal rhythm describes the ECG of a dying patient, characterized by slow, irregular, and wide ventricular complexes that eventually stop (see ELECTROCARDIOGRAM). It is often seen in the terminal stages of a failed attempt at cardiac resuscitation.
