## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Application integration (sometimes called enterprise application integration or EAI) is the process of bringing data or a function from one application program together with that of another application program.

## Source[^2]
- Application integration enables multiple software applications to work together seamlessly. Through application integration, businesses can modernize their infrastructure and provide greater support for various operations. Businesses can implement application integration as a one-time use, for on-demand data and information processing, or for ongoing two-way synchronization. The more on-premise and cloud apps a business has, the more complex integration is.
