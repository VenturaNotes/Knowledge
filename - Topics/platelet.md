- (thrombocyte) $n$. a disc-shaped cell structure, 1-2 $\mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter, that is present in the blood. With Romanowsky stains platelets appear as fragments of pale-blue cytoplasm with a few red granules. They have several functions, all relating to the arrest of bleeding (see BLOOD COAGULATION; PLATELET ACTIVATION). There are normally 150-400 $\times 10^{9}$ platelets per litre of blood. See also THROMBOPOIESIS.

- (thrombocyte) A minute disc-shaped cell fragment, 2-3 $\mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter, occurring in mammalian blood. Platelets are formed as fragments of larger cells (megakaryocytes) found in red bone marrow; they have no nucleus. They play an important role in blood clotting and release thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$, serotonin and other chemicals, which cause a chain of events leading to the formation of a plug at the site of the damage, thus preventing further blood loss. There are typically 250,000 to 400,000 platelets per cubic millimetre in mammalian blood.
