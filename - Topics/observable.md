- In quantum theory, a quantity which may be measured such as position, energy, or momentum (see measurement). Observables are associated with Hermitian operators, and the possible measurements of the observable are the eigenvalues of the operator. Two observables are simultaneously measurable if the operators commute, which is not the case with position and momentum (see Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle).
