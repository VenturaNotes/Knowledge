- A Gaussian process with independent nonoverlapping increments. It is named after Robert Brown (1773-1858), a botanist who in 1827 first observed under a microscope the random movement of pollen or dust particles floating in water. The name is used both for this phenomenon and for the mathematical model that describes it; the latter is also known as the Wiener process.
