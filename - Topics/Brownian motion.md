- A Gaussian process with independent nonoverlapping increments. It is named after Robert Brown (1773-1858), a botanist who in 1827 first observed under a microscope the random movement of pollen or dust particles floating in water. The name is used both for this phenomenon and for the mathematical model that describes it; the latter is also known as the Wiener process.

- Brownian motion, named after the Scottish botanist Robert Brown (1773-1858), describes the random motions of a particle in a medium. Within mathematics, the term relates to a stochastic process introduced by Norbert Wiener. The Wiener process $W_{t}$ for $t \geq 0$, models the movement of such a particle beginning at the origin at $t=0$ and is characterized by the following properties:
	- (i) $W_{0}=0$
	- (ii) Future displacements $W_{t+u}-W_{t}$ (where $u \geq 0$ ) are independent of $W_{s}$ where $s \leq t$.
	- (iii) $W_{t+u}-W_{t}$ (where $u \geq 0$ ) has normal distribution with mean 0 and variance $u$.
	- (iv) $W_{t}$ is continuous in $t$.
