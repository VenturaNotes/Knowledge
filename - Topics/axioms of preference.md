- A set of assumptions that characterize rational preferences. The standard axioms are completeness (given any two options $x$ and $y$ then either $x$ is at least as good as $y$ or $y$ is at least as good as $x$ ), transitivity (if $x$ is at least as good as $y$ and $y$ is at least as good as $z$, then $x$ is at least as good as $z$ ), and reflexivity ( $x$ is at least as good as $x$ ). Preferences that satisfy these axioms can be represented by a set of indifference curves that do not cross. This represents the starting point for the standard theory of choice.
