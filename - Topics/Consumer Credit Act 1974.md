- A UK Act of Parliament aimed at protecting the borrower in credit agreements, loans, and mortgages. The Act requires full written details of the true interest rate (i.e. annual percentage rate) to be quoted; a cooling-off period to be given, during which borrowers may change their minds and cancel agreements; and all agreements to be in writing. The Act does not cover overdrafts. The Consumer Credit Act 2006 updates and extends the scope of the 1974 Act.
