- A market in which conditions are better for buyers than for sellers. This occurs, for example, when sellers are numerous and under pressure to raise money quickly, while buyers are scarce and can afford to wait. In such a situation it is likely that prices will be unusually low and that conditions of sale will be unusually favourable for buyers.
