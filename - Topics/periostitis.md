- $n$. inflammation of the membrane surrounding a bone (see PERIOSTEUM). Acute periostitis results from direct injury to the bone and is associated with a haematoma, which may later become infected. The uncomplicated condition subsides quickly with rest and anti-inflammatory analgesics. Chronic periostitis sometimes follows but is more often due to an inflammatory disease, such as tuberculosis or syphilis, or to a chronic ulcer overlying the bone involved. Chronic periostitis causes thickening of the underlying bone, which is evident on X-ray.
