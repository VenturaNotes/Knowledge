- A chatbot is an AI-enabled program that can simulate human conversations through a chat interface. Chatbots usually appear on customer-facing portalsâ€”most commonly on websites and mobile apps. They simulate the experience of customers talking to sales reps. However, chatbots are simply responding to a script. They use the script to determine how to assist a customer in need best. Even as recently as a decade ago, chatbots were considered a relatively advanced feature, but today, their use has become widely popularized.
