- A diagram providing a visual representation of the proportions into which something is divided. It consists of a circle divided in sectors, the area of each sector representing the proportion of a specified component.
## Source[^2]
- A diagram in which percentages are shown as sectors of a circle. If $x$ percent of the prey of a carnivore comprises species $X, y$ percent species $Y$, and $z$ percent species $Z$, a pie chart would show three sectors having central angles $3.6 x^{\circ}, 3.6 y^{\circ}$, and $3.6 z^{\circ}$.

- $n$. A circular graph divided into sectors, resembling slices of a pie, with areas proportional to the sizes of the categories represented (see illustration). This method of displaying data was introduced in 1801 by the Scottish political economist William Playfair (1759-1823), in a book entitled The Statistical Breviary. The Italian-born British nurse Florence Nightingale (1820-1910), with help from the English medical statistician William Farr (1807-83), popularized a version in which the sectors subtend equal angles at the centre and the sizes of the categories are represented by radii of different lengths. An early version, which she called the bat's wing, was published in her report entitled Mortality of the British Army (1858), and an improved version, with the areas of the sectors rather than the lengths of the radii proportional to the category sizes, first appeared in her confidential report to the government entitled Notes on Matters Affecting the Health of the British Army (1858).
