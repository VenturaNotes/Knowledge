- $n$. the alternation of active inhalation (or inspiration) of air into the lungs through the mouth or nose with the passive exhalation (or expiration) of the air. During inhalation the diaphragm and intercostal muscles contract, which enlarges the chest cavity and draws air into the lungs. Relaxation of these muscles forces air out of the lungs at exhalation. (See illustration.) Breathing is part of respiration and is sometimes called external respiration. There are many types of breathing in which the rhythm, rate, or character is abnormal. See also APNOEA; BRONCHOSPASM; CheYne-StOKES RESPIRATION; DYSPNOEA; STRIDOR.
