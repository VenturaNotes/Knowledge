- Those factors that restrict the ability of a firm to move from one strategic group within an industry to another (in effect, to adopt a radically different and more competitive strategy). As described by Michael Porter in 1980, these may include investment costs, the nature of the market, and the firm's internal capacities. Mobility barriers are thus analogous to the barriers to entry or exit that apply to an industry as a whole.
