- A note sent to a customer by a supplier of goods to advise him that an order has been fulfilled. The advice note may either accompany the goods or be sent separately, thus preceding the sales invoice and any delivery note. The advice note refers to a particular batch of goods, denoting them by their marks and numbers (if more than one package); it also details the date and method of dispatch.
