- A form upon which a taxpayer makes an annual statement of income and personal circumstances, enabling claims to be made for personal allowances. In the UK an income tax return also requires details of capital gains in the year. The onus is on the taxpayer to provide HM Revenue and Customs with the appropriate information even if the taxpayer receives no tax return. Categories of tax payer who can expect to receive a tax return include the self-employed, company directors, people with a high investment income, and those acting as trustees or personal representatives. Since 1996-97 income tax returns have included a section for self-assessment, in which the tax payer calculates his or her own liability for income tax. Separate returns are required for inheritance tax purposes and in respect of VAT and excise duties. It is possible to complete and send back a tax return over the Internet.

- A report by a taxpayer to the tax authorities of his or her income, and of any facts affecting their entitlement to tax allowances. Tax returns may be demanded by the tax authorities, with legal penalties for failing to make returns. Alternatively, where a withholding tax system is in force, it may be left to taxpayers to make tax returns as a condition for reclaiming any tax refunds to which they are entitled.
