- $n$. eczema of the hands (see also CHEIROPOMPHOLYX) and feet (podopompholyx). Because the horny layer of the skin in these parts is so thick, the vesicles typical of eczema cannot rupture; they therefore persist in the skin, looking like sago grains. There is intense itching until the skin eventually peels. There may be secondary infection due to scratching. Pompholyx is commonest in early adulthood and attacks occur suddenly, lasting some weeks. The disease may be recurrent or persist as a chronic condition.
