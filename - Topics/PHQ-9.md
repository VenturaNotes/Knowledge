- (Patient Health Questionnaire) a screening tool designed to identify people who may suffer from depression. The instrument's nine questions are based on DSM diagnostic criteria for depression. Each item is scored by the patient from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). A PHQ-9 score of $\geq 10$ indicates a reasonably high likelihood of major depression. It has been validated for use in primary care, in which it is commonly used not only for screening depression but also for monitoring the progress of treatment.
