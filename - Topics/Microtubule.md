## Source [^1]
- A microscopic tubular structure, with an external diameter of 24 nm and of variable length, found in a wide range of eukaryotic cells. Microtubules are composed of numerous subunits of the globular protein tubulin, and can occur singly or in pairs, triplets, or bundles. Each tubulin protein is a dimer consisting of two slightly different polypeptides$\textemdash$$\alpha$-tubulin and $\beta$-tubulin$\textemdash$which gives each microtubule distinct 'plus' and 'minus' ends. Each tubule can add or lose tubulin dimers from its 'plus' end, depending on levels of free GTP-bound dimers. If these are abundant, the microtubule binds more dimers and gets longer; if they are in short supply, dimers dissociate from the microtubule, which gets shorter. This state is called dynamic instability.
- Microtubules help cells to maintain their shape by resisting compressive forces (see CYTOSKELETON); they also occur in cilia and eukaryotic flagella (sense 2) and the centrioles and form the spindle during nuclear division. A further role is in the intracellular transport of materials and movement of organelles. Formation of microtubules is initiated at microtubule-organizing centres (MTOCs). Compare MICROFILAMENT; INTERMEDIATE FILAMENT.
