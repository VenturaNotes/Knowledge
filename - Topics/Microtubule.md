## Source [^1]
- A microscopic tubular structure, with an external diameter of 24 nm and of variable length, found in a wide range of eukaryotic cells. Microtubules are composed of numerous subunits of the globular protein tubulin, and can occur singly or in pairs, triplets, or bundles. Each tubulin protein is a dimer consisting of two slightly different polypeptides$\textemdash$$\alpha$-tubulin and $\beta$-tubulin$\textemdash$which gives each microtubule distinct 'plus' and 'minus' ends. Each tubule can add or lose tubulin dimers from its 'plus' end, depending on levels of free GTP-bound dimers. If these are abundant, the microtubule binds more dimers and gets longer; if they are in short supply, dimers dissociate from the microtubule, which gets shorter. This state is called dynamic instability.
- Microtubules help cells to maintain their shape by resisting compressive forces (see CYTOSKELETON); they also occur in cilia and eukaryotic flagella (sense 2) and the centrioles and form the spindle during nuclear division. A further role is in the intracellular transport of materials and movement of organelles. Formation of microtubules is initiated at microtubule-organizing centres (MTOCs). Compare MICROFILAMENT; INTERMEDIATE FILAMENT.

- $n$. Any of the comparatively rigid, hollow protein tunnels, with an outside diameter of approximately 25 nanometres and an inside diameter of approximately 14 nm , up to several millimetres in length, forming part of the cytoskeleton within the cytoplasm of almost all cells, including neurons, where such tunnels are involved in anterograde transport and retrograde transport within axons and dendrites. The molecules of tubulin, the protein of which it is composed, can exist in at least two different geometrical configurations, in one of which it bends about 30 degrees from the direction of the microtubule, enabling movement to occur, for example during mitosis, and possibly encoding and transmitting signals within the cell like a cellular automaton. The cilia of paramecia consist of bundles of microtubules. See also neurofibril, Paramecium. \[From Greek mikros small + Latin tubulus a little pipe, diminutive of tubus a pipe]
