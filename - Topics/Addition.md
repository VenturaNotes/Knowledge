- Addition is a function

## Source[^2]
- A binary operation present in many algebraic structures, which is invariably commutative and associative. The inputs are addends, and the output is their sum. Addition of natural numbers might concretely be considered as the accumulation of numbers of objects, but formal definitions are needed for more complicated mathematical objects (see ADDITION (of complex numbers), ADDITION (of matrices), ADDITION (of vectors)) and especially for infinite series. See also COMPONENTWISE, POINTWISE ADDITION, ALGEBRA OF LIMITS, ADDITIVE FUNCTION.
