- Equations relating to an object moving in a straight line with constant acceleration $a$. Let $u$ be the initial velocity, $v$ the final velocity, $t$ the time of travel, and $s$ the displacement from the starting point. Then $$\begin{align}v = u + at, \qquad s=ut+\frac 12at^2 \\ s= \frac 12(u +v)t, \qquad v^2 = u^2+2as\end{align}$$Collectively these equations are often referred to as the 'suvat' equations
