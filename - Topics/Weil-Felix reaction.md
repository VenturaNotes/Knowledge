- a diagnostic test for typhus. A sample of the patient's serum is tested for the presence of antibodies against the organism Proteus vulgaris. Although this relatively harmless organism is not the cause of typhus, it possesses certain antigens in common with the causative agent of the disease and can therefore be used instead of it in laboratory tests. Typhus is suspected if antibodies are found to be present. \[E. Weil (1880-1922), German physician; A. Felix (1887-1956), Czech bacteriologist]
