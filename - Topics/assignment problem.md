- A problem in which things of one type are to be matched with the same number of things of another type in a way that is, in a specified sense, the best possible. For example, when $n$ workers are to be assigned to $n$ jobs, it may be possible to specify the value $v_{ij}$ to the company, measured in suitable units, if the $i$-th worker is assigned to the $j$-th job. The values $v_{ij}$ may be displayed as the entries of an $n \times n$ matrix. By introducing suitable variables, the problem of assigning workers to jobs in such a way as to maximize the total value to the company can be formulated as a linear programming problem.
