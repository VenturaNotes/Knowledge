- The risk of direct or indirect loss resulting from inadequate or failed internal processes and systems, or from a wide variety of external events. The control of operational risk has been the object of much attention in recent years, for example in the Basle Accords concerning the capital adequacy of banks and in the Turnbull Report in the UK. It has also led to changes in the regulation of financial institutions and the requirements for the listing of public companies. Some major categories of operational risk include fraud and theft, legal action (e.g. by employees or customers), natural disaster, vandalism (including cybervandalism), and computer system failure.
