- (serosa) a smooth transparent membrane, consisting of mesothelium and underlying elastic fibrous connective tissue, lining certain large cavities of the body. The peritoneum of the abdomen, pleura of the chest, and pericardium of the heart are all serous membranes. Each consists of two portions: the parietal portion lines the walls of the cavity, and the visceral portion covers the organs concerned. The two are continuous, forming a closed sac with the organs essentially outside the sac. The inner surface of the sac is moistened by a thin fluid derived from blood serum, which allows frictionless movement of organs within their cavities. Compare MUCOUS MEMBRANE.

- (serosa) A tissue consisting of a layer of mesothelium attached to a surface by a thin layer of connective tissue. Serous membrane lines body cavities that do not open to the exterior; the peritoneum, pleura, and serous pericardium are examples.
