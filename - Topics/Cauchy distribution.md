- The Cauchy distribution has probability density function $f(x)=\frac{1}{\pi\left(1+x^{2}\right)}$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$. It has undefined expectation, variance, and moment generating function. If random variables $X$ and $Y$ have the standard normal distributions, then $X / Y$ has the Cauchy distribution.
