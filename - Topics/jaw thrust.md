- a manoeuvre for opening the airway of an unconscious patient. The flats of the hands are placed on the cheeks with the fingers hooked under the angles of the jaw so that the jaw can be pulled upwards to separate the tongue from the back of the pharynx. The tongue often falls onto the back of the pharynx in unconsciousness, causing obstruction to the airway. This method is particularly useful when spinal injury is suspected and movement of the neck is undesirable. This is an alternative to the head tilt, chin lift manoeuvre.
