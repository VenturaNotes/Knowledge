- The document that governs the running of a company. It sets out voting rights of shareholders, conduct of shareholders' and directors' meetings, powers of the management, etc. Either the articles are submitted with the founding documents when application is made for incorporation or the relevant model articles contained in the Companies Regulations are adopted. In 2009 new model articles for private and public companies limited by shares were provided under the Companies Act 2006. The articles constitute a contract between the company and its members but this applies only to the rights of shareholders in their capacity as members. Therefore directors or company solicitors (for example) cannot use the articles to enforce their rights. The articles of a public company may be altered by a special resolution of the members in a general meeting or by written resolution.
