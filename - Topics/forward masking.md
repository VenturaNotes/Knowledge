- $n$. A form of masking that occurs when the perception of a stimulus called the test stimulus is diminished or eliminated by the presentation of a different stimulus called the masking stimulus that precedes it. In the case of visual masking, when the test stimulus and masking stimulus do not overlap spatially, the phenomenon is called paracontrast. See also auditory masking. Compare backward masking, SIMULTANEOUS MASKING.
