- A business involved in credit brokerage, debt adjusting, debt counselling, debt collecting, debt administration, or the operation of a credit-reference agency (see CREDIT RATING).
	- Credit brokerage includes the effecting of introductions of individuals wishing to obtain credit to persons carrying on a consumer-credit business.
	- Debt adjusting is the process by which a third party negotiates terms for the discharge of a debt due under consumer-credit agreements or consumerhire agreements with the creditor or owner on behalf of the debtor or hirer. The latter may also pay a third party to take over an obligation to discharge a debt or to undertake any similar activity concerned with its liquidation.
	- Debt counselling is the giving of advice (other than by the original creditor and certain others) to debtors or hirers about the liquidation of debts due under consumer-credit agreements or consumer-hire agreements.
	- A credit-reference agency collects information concerning the financial standing of individuals and supplies this information to those seeking it.
	- Debt administration, which was legally recognized as a form of ancillary credit business in 2006, is the process in which an administrator is appointed to manage the property of a debtor, including his or her salary or wages. The debt administrator may be appointed by court order (see ADMINISTRATION ORDER) or by a voluntary decision of the debtor.
- The Consumer Credit Act 1974 provides for the licensing of ancillary credit businesses and regulates their activities.
