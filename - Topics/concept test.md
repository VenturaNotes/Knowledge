- A technique used in marketing research to assess the reactions of consumers to a new product or a proposed change to an existing product (see NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT). Before an organization invests in production facilities for a new product it writes a concept statement describing the proposed product and commissions a market researcher to interview a small number of potential consumers either in group discussion or depth interview. Respondents are shown the concept statement and their reactions are explored in detail. The results of these interviews help the organization to understand what it should do with the proposed product if it is to be successful.
