- A mixture of hydrogen peroxide and iron(II) sulphate used to produce free radicals by reactions of the type $$\begin{align}Fe^{2+} + H_2O_2 \to Fe^{3+} + \cdot OH + OH^{-}\\Fe^{3+} + H_2O_2 \to Fe^{2+}+\cdot OOH + H^+\end{align}$$It is used in water treatment and as a reagent in organic synthesis to introduce an OH group into an aromatic drug. Fenton's reagent was discovered by Henry John Horstman Fenton (1854-1929) in 1894.
