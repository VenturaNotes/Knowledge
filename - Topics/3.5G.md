- 3.5G refers to a telecommunications speed that is between 3G and 4G, which came from technological improvements. These improvements allowed for faster download speed and lower latency. It is also known as High-Speed Downlink Packet Access. The speed of 3.5G offers a marked improvement over 3G, but it fails to meet the new network requirements for a 4G system. Furthermore, new infrastructure is not necessary to deploy 3.5G phones or internet-capable devices.
