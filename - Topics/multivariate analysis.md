- The study of multiple measurements on a sample. It embraces many techniques related to a range of different problems.
- Cluster analysis seeks to define homogeneous classes within the sample on the basis of the measured variables. Discriminant analysis is a technique for deciding whether an individual should be assigned to a particular predefined class on the basis of the measured variables. Principle component analysis and factor analysis aim to reduce the number of variables in the study to a few (say two or three) that express most of the variation within a sample.
- Multivariate probability distributions define probabilities for sets of random variables.
## Source[^2]
- A statistical procedure that simultaneously analyses multiple measurements on each individual or object under study in a marketing-research enquiry. Examples of the procedures used include multiple regression, factor analysis, cluster analysis (see CLUSTER THEORY), and conjoint analysis.
