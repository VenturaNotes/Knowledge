- An asset for which the pay-off depends upon future events that are not under the control of the company holding the asset. The uncertainty of future events means that these assets are not placed on the company's balance sheet but do appear in the financial statement notes. See also CONTINGENT COMMODITY.

- (contingent gain) A possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence of one or more uncertain future events, which are not wholly in the control of the accounting entity. For example, if a company is making a substantial legal claim against another organization, the company has a contingent asset (depending upon the successful outcome of the claim). Under the Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland, an entity should not recognize a contingent asset unless the appropriate economic events are virtually certain (in which case the asset is not really a contingent asset). Compare CONTINGENT LIABILITY.
