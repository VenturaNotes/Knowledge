- Function point (FP) measures the functionality of a computer system. In other words, it tells businesses how well a system performs and the value it provides to users. Companies work out FP using a complicated calculation. It involves counting things such as inputs, queries, and internal files. Then companies have to adjust that total based on the complexity of the system. Function point analysis helps businesses understand how functional a system is rather than how well a software company developed it.
