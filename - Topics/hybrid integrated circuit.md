## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A complete electronic circuit that is fabricated on an insulating substrate using a variety of device technologies. The substrate acts as a carrier for the circuit and also has the interconnecting tracks between devices printed on it by multilayer techniques. Individual devices, which comprise chip diodes, transistors, integrated circuits, and thick-film resistors and capacitors and which form the circuit function, are attached to the substrate and are connected together using the previously defined interconnecting tracks.
