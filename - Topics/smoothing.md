- A means by which a table of values $f\left(x_{0}\right), f\left(x_{1}\right), \ldots, f\left(x_{m}\right)$ at the distinct points $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{m}$, can be approximated (represented) by a function, say$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} c_{i} \upvarphi_{i}(x)$$where $\upvarphi_{i}(x), i=1,2, \ldots, n$, are chosen, and the coefficients $c_{i}, i=1,2, \ldots, n$, are to be determined. Typically $m>n$. The objective is to choose a fit that reduces the effect of random errors in the data combined with producing a curve that is smooth (no rapid changes or oscillations) between the data points. This is generally referred to as smoothing. The smoothing is often achieved by using low-degree polynomials (with suitable $\upvarphi_{i}(x)$ and the coefficients $c_{i}$ are frequently determined by the least-squares criterion (see APPROXIMATION THEORY). Compare INTERPOLATION.
