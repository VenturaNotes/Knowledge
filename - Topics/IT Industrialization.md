- IT industrialization refers to the standardization of IT (Information Technology) processes over time. Like other fields, IT is ever-changing and constantly adapting to meet the needs of varying types of organizations. This leaves quite a bit of room for error. To mitigate these risks, IT industrialization focuses on creating standards that define the best practices and then implementing them. With predesigned and pre-configured settings, IT practices are automated, repeatable, and reliable. This, in turn, creates predictable results at a lower cost with higher levels of customer satisfaction.
