- A UK system of grants from central government to local authorities in place between 1967 and 1990. As the name implies, these grants were used to supplement the revenues of local authorities, which were not able to raise enough local taxation from rates to pay for their expenditure. The system created an incentive for councils to spend excessively because part of the burden fell on central government.
