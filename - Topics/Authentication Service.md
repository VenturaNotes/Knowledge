- An authentication service is an identity verification mechanism—similar to passwords—for apps, websites, or software systems. It is designed to authenticate the identity of clients (or users) by servers (a computer program), and vice versa. It works similar to time-sharing operating systems that allow many users to perform tasks simultaneously using the same computer memory. An authentication service makes sure that information is accessed only by users who have the access permission or right.

- The primary role of an authentication server is to verify the identity of users or clients and ensure that only permitted users access information
- The server confirms the client's identity and vice versa in client-server interaction in authentication services
- Similarities between authentication service and time-sharing operating systems
	- Both allow concurrent access to a shared system
	- Both manage user access to shared memory
