- an uncommon anorectal condition that produces symptoms of anal pain, rectal bleeding, straining during defecation, and obstructed defecation (dyssynergic defecation). Proctoscopy reveals one or more benign rectal lesions, which are thought to be due to abnormal straining during defecation leading to prolapse of the distal anterior rectal wall and internal anal intussusception.
