- Let the complex numbers $z_1$ and $z_2$, where $z_1 = a + bi$ and $z_2 = c + di$, be represented by the points $P_1$ and $P_2$ in the complex plane. Then $z_1 + z_2 = (a+c)+(b+d)i$, and $z_1 + z_2$ is represented in the complex plane by the point $Q$ such that $OP_1QP_2$ is a parallelogram; that is, such that $\overrightarrow {OQ} = \overrightarrow {OP}_1 + \overrightarrow {OP}_2$. In this way the addition of complex numbers corresponds exactly to the addition of vectors.
