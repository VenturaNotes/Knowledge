## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A programming language with strong abstraction from the details of the computer. Compared to low-level programming languages, it may use natural language elements, be easier to use, or be more portable across computing platforms.

## Source[^2]
- A variety of programming language in which the control and data structures reflect the requirements of the problem rather than the facilities actually provided by the hardware. A high-level language is translated into machine code by a compiler.
## Source[^3]
- A computer-programming language that is designed to reflect the needs of the programmer rather than the capabilities of the computer. Such languages use abstract data and control structures, and symbolic names for variables. There are a large number of high-level languages; BASIC, COBOL, Fortran, and C are examples.
