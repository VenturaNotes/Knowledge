- In economics, the property of a dynamic system to retain a memory or lagging effect in which the order of previous events can influence the order of subsequent events. If a system with hysteresis that is initially in equilibrium is subjected to a shock, its new equilibrium position depends on what happens during the process of dynamic adjustment (the path dependence property). In behavioral economics, when the disutility from a loss is greater than the utility from an equal gain, the utility of a person going through a cycle of gaining and losing exhibits hysteresis: after subsequent events of a gain and a loss of an item they are worse off than if they had never received the initial gain.
