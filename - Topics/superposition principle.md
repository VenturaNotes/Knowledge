- If $y_1$ and $y_2$ are solutions of a homogeneous linear differential equation $Ly = 0$, then $c_1y_1 + c_2y_2$ is also a solution, by definition of $L$ being linear. The same may also be true of an infinite sum $$\sum_{k=0}^\infty c_ky_k$$of solutions $y_k$, though issues of convergence and differentiability may need addressing carefully. Given a homogeneous linear boundary value problem, a general solution may be sought as an infinite sum of separable solutions with the coefficients $c_k$ being determined using Fourier analysis.
