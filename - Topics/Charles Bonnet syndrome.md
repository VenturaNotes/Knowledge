- $n$. Visual hallucinations in people who have lost their vision, experienced most commonly during the first year to 18 months after becoming blind, sometimes with micropsia. It is a common condition, experienced by many (perhaps most) people who suffer significant visual loss, and those who are not prepared for it are sometimes alarmed, believing that they are losing their sanity. It is named after the Swiss naturalist and philosopher Charles Bonnet (1720-93) whose grandfather, almost blind from cataracts in both eyes, hallucinated men, women, birds, carriages, buildings, tapestries, and other objects, as first described by Bonnet in his Essai analytique sur les facultés de l'âme (1760, pp. 426-8), although it was not widely known in English-speaking countries until 1982, when an article describing it appeared in the journal Age and Ageing.
