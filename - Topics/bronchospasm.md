- $n$. narrowing of bronchi by muscular contraction in response to some stimulus, as in asthma and bronchitis. The patient can usually inhale air into the lungs, but exhalation may require visible muscular effort and is accompanied by expiratory noises that are clearly audible (see wheeze) or detectable with a stethoscope. The condition in which bronchospasm can usually be relieved by bronchodilator drugs is known as reversible obstructive airways disease and includes asthma; that in which bronchodilator drugs usually have no effect is irreversible obstructive airways disease and includes chronic bronchitis.
