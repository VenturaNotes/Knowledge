- $n$. In statistics, an index of the degree of agreement between two raters classifying the same set of items, ranging from zero when agreement is no better than chance to 1 (except in certain special cases) when agreement is perfect. It is calculated by dividing the difference between the observed proportion of cases in which the raters agree and the proportion expected by chance by the maximum difference possible between the observed and expected proportions, assuming fixed row and column totals (marginals). The statistic was introduced by the US psychologist Jacob (Jack) Cohen (1923-98) in an article in the journal Educational and Psychological Measurement in 1960. Also called Cohen's kappa coefficient. Symbol: K. See also Kendall coefficient of CONCORDANCE. \[From kappa ($K$), the tenth letter of the Greek alphabet]
