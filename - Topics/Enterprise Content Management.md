- Enterprise content management (ECM) manages content for businesses by creating, storing, distributing and archiving unstructured content in a centralized digital system. This content can include emails, reports, medical images, office document, and scanned documents. ECM also analyzes how organizations use their content so that they can ensure delivery of relevant content to the right employees at the right time.
