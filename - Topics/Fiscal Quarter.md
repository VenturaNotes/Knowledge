- A fiscal quarter can be defined as a three-month period within a company’s fiscal year that serves as a basis for financial reporting and dividend payment. Some businesses have fiscal quarters that do not correspond to the fiscal quarters of the calendar, depending on their company financial strategy. For instance, it is commonplace for companies to close their fourth fiscal quarter after the most profitable time of the year for their business. Typically, organizations abbreviate their fiscal quarters using the letter Q, followed by the corresponding quarter number. For instance, Q3 would be the abbreviation for a company’s third fiscal quarter.
