- a condition in which an individual belongs to one gender on the basis of physical appearance and genetics but identifies psychologically with the other gender. The name was introduced in DSM-5; in DSM-IV-TR it was called gender identity disorder. The condition is diagnosed only where there is evidence of strong and persistent crossgender identification and discomfort about one's sex, these cause significant distress and social impairment, and there is no concurrent endocrine disorder. Treatment may include counselling, hormone therapy, and gender reassignment surgery. See also TRANSGENDER.
