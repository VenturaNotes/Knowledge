- (height-balanced, depth-balanced) Denoting a tree that has height (and thus depth) approximately equal to the logarithm of the number of nodes in the tree. This property is usually achieved in a binary tree by ensuring every node is balanced according to some measure. See also AVL TREE, B-TREE.

## Source[^2]
- (of a set) A subset $A$ of a vector space where for each element $x$ in $A, t x$ belongs to $A$ if $|t|<1$. For example, a sphere centered at the origin in Cartesian space is a balanced set.
