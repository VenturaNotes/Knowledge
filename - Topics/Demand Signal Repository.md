- A demand signal repository (DSR) is a database that stores, cleans, and simplifies external data. This data is typically called demand data, which is centered around consumer demand. DSRs organize large amounts of data that come from different platforms or tools such as point-of-sale (POS) data or customer loyalty data. This data is then used by other apps and tools to support business planning, such as analyzing insights about shoppers or stocking and transportation planning.
