- Suppose that $(R, +, \times)$ and $(R', \oplus, \otimes)$ are rings. An isomorphism between them is a one-to-one onto mapping $f$ from the set R to the set $R'$ such that, for all $a$ and $b$ in R, $$\begin{align} f(a+b) &= f(a)\oplus f(b), \\ f(a\times b) &= f(a) \otimes f(b). \end{align}$$If there is an isomorphism between two rings, the rings are isomorphic to each other and, as with isomorphic groups, the two have essentially the same structure.
