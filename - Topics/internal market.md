- The territories of all European Union (EU) member states viewed as a single integrated market. The internal market has been a focus of EU policy with the aim of creating an economic area that has free movement of goods, labour, services, and capital.

### (Health Service)
- The system whereby one section of the UK National Health Service which uses facilities provided by other sections has to pay for them. This is intended to gain the cost-saving benefits of competition, and lead to more efficient utilization of the total resources used.
