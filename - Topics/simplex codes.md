- A family of linear error-correcting or error-detecting block codes, easily implemented as polynomial codes (by means of shift registers). Considered as $( n, k )$ codes (see BLOCK CODE), they have codeword length$$n = q^{k}-1$$Binary simplex codes have a minimum Hamming distance equal to $2^{k-1}$. They can be regarded as Reed-Muller codes shortened by one digit, and are identical with the m-sequences of length $2^{k}-1$, together with the zero word. They are so called because their codewords form a simplex in Hamming space.
