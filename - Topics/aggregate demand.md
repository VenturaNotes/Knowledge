- Aggregate demand is the total quantity of goods and services demanded across all levels of the economy at a given overall price level and in a given time period. It reflects the total spending on domestic goods and services in an economy, encompassing consumption, investment, government spending, and net exports. Changes in aggregate demand can influence economic growth, inflation, and employment levels

## Source[^2]
- The total of intended or ex ante attempts to spend on final goods and services produced in a country. In a closed economy aggregate demand is the sum of consumption, investment, and government spending on goods and services. In an open economy in addition to this it includes export demand and excludes imports. A rise in aggregate demand is a necessary condition for an increase in real output. It is not a sufficient condition, however, unless an economy has spare capacity to produce the goods and services demanded. If the goods demanded are available only as imports, these rise; if the extra goods are not available at all, inflationary pressure is created.
