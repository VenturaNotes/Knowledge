- A type of transport protein that transports two or more substances simultaneously across a cell membrane. Energy is derived by movement of one of the substances (usually an ion) down its concentration gradient; this drives movement of the other substance against its concentration gradient. In antiporters the two substances move in opposite directions, whereas in symporters they move in the same direction.
