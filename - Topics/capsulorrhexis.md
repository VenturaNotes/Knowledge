- $n$. a continuous tear made in the lens capsule of the eye. In anterior capsulorrhexis, performed during cataract surgery, the tear is made in the anterior surface of the capsule. It has the advantage over a capsulotomy in making the residual capsule much more resilient to being torn during surgery.
