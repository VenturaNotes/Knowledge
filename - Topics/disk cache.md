- An instance of cache memory used to store recently read sections of disk file on the grounds that they may well be required again shortly, and to store items required to be written to disk until a convenient time occurs. The former technique is safe, but the latter is more sensitive to power or systems failures and other unexpected events, and can be disabled either completely or for specific files. The technique is used because the RAM of cache memory is much faster to access than disk storage.
