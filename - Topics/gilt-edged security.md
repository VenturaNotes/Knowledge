- (gilt) A fixed-interest security or stock issued by the British government in the form of Exchequer stocks or Treasury stocks. Gilts are among the safest of all investments, as the government is unlikely to default on interest or on principal repayments. They may be irredeemable (see CONSOLs) or redeemable. Redeemable gilts are classified as: long-dated gilts or longs (not redeemable for 15 years or more), medium-dated gilts or mediums (redeemable in 5 to 15 years), or short-dated gilts or shorts (redeemable in less than 5 years).
- Like most fixed-interest securities, gilts are sensitive not only to interest rates but also inflation rates. This led the government to introduce index-linked gilts in the 1970s, with interest payments moving in a specified way relative to inflation.
- Most gilts are issued in units of $£ 100$. If they pay a high rate of interest (i.e. higher than the current rate) a $£ 100$ unit may be worth more than $£ 100$ for a period of its life, even though it will only pay $£ 100$ on redemption.

- (gilts) A fixed-interest security issued by the UK government. Gilts include irredeemable Consols; long-dated, with 15 years or more to maturity; medium-dated, with 5 to 15 years to maturity; or short-dated, with under 5 years to maturity. Gilt-edged securities are considered extremely safe from risk of default, but fluctuate in price inversely with current interest rates, long-dated securities being most at risk. Index-linked gilts are also available, reducing the risk from inflation.
