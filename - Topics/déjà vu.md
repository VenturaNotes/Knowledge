## Source[^2]
- $n$. A form of paramnesia (1) distinguished by a delusion of having already seen or experienced before something that is in reality being encountered for the first time. Less common variants include déjà entendu (already heard), déjà éprouvé (already experienced or tested), déjà fait (already done), déjà pensé (already thought), déjà raconté (already told or recounted), déjà voulu (already desired). The term first appeared in a letter to the editor of the journal Revue Philosophique in 1876 and became popular after the English neurologist J(ohn) Hughlings Jackson (1835-1911) used it in an article in the journal Brain in 1888. It is most common in people between 20 and 25 years old, 75 to 80 per cent of whom experience it, and it tends to occur less frequently as people get older. See also parapraxis, promnesia. Compare jamais vu. \[From French déjà already $+~v u$ seen]
