- A greedy algorithm is a simple algorithm that solves a problem by choosing the most optimal option for the stage it is currently attempting to bypass. A greedy algorithm does not take into account the big picture of the overall issue it is trying to solve. Instead, it disregards any consequences that may occur later as a result of choosing the most optimal solution for the stage it is currently attempting to bypass. Although greedy algorithms are optimal algorithms to use when immediate answers are needed to solve a current problem at hand, they also tend to result in the worst possible global outcome. Greedy algorithms are typically used when programmers need real-time, approximate solutions to coding issues, as they typically are easy to implement and choose the best optimal solution to a coding issue at a given point in time.
