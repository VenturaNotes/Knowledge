- an autoimmune condition affecting the salivary and lacrimal glands, resulting in a dry mouth and dryness of the eyes. In the systemic form of the disease other glands may be affected, causing dryness of the airways, vagina, or skin, as well as the joints (producing a relatively mild form of arthritis) and muscles (which ache), and there may be tiredness and lethargy. Sjögren's syndrome may also occur secondarily to other conditions (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis). Symptomatic treatment, including saliva and tear substitutes, is available. Patients are susceptible to dental caries. \[H. S. C. Sjögren (1899-1986), Swedish ophthalmologist]
