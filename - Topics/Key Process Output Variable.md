- Key Process Output Variable (KPOV) is the most important output variable during any process, manufacturing or otherwise. For example, take a manufacturing process that produces candy. In this instance, the KPOV could be something like ingredient accuracy or staff efficiency. The KPOV would be the most important variable to monitor during an entire process. As such, businesses would want to spend the time to ensure that the KPOV was being appropriately managed.
