- (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) a technique of assisted conception that has revolutionized the treatment of severe male infertility. Spermatozoa are aspirated or extracted from the testis or epididymis (see MESA; PESA) and a single sperm is injected into the cytoplasm of a secondary oocyte in vitro. The fertilized ovum is then implanted into the uterus.
## Source[^2]
- abbrev. Intracytoplasmic sperm injection, an extension of in vitro fertilization (IVF) first introduced in Belgium in 1992, in which sperm are injected directly into the ovum with a fine needle. Unlike IVF, ICSI can be used for artificial insemination with sperm that have no motility and are therefore incapable of fertilizing ova on their own. \[From Latin intra within + Greek kytos a vessel + plasma a form + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
