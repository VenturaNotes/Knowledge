## Source[^2]
- (in neurology) A part of the nervous system, consisting of a group of nerve cells, that coordinates a particular process. An example is the respiratory center in the vertebrate brainstem, which controls breathing movements. The stimulation of a center will initiate the process, while destruction of the center will prevent or impair it. See also CARDIOVASCULAR CENTER.
