- $n$. one of the two types of light-sensitive cells in the retina of the eye (compare CONE). The human eye contains about 125 million rods, which are necessary for seeing in dim light. They contain a pigment, rhodopsin (or visual purple), which is broken down (bleached) in the light and regenerated in the dark. Breakdown of visual purple gives rise to nerve impulses; when all the pigment is bleached (i.e. in bright light) the rods no longer function. See also DARK ADAPTATION; LIGHT ADAPTATION.
