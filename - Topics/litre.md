- $n$. a unit of volume equal to the volume occupied by 1 kilogram of pure water at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and 760 mmHg pressure. In SI units the litre is treated as a special name for the cubic decimetre, but is not used when a high degree of accuracy is required ( 1 litre $=1.0000028 \mathrm{~dm}^{3}$ ). For approximate purposes 1 litre is assumed to be equal to 1000 cubic centimetres $\left(\mathrm{cm}^{3}\right)$, therefore 1 millilitre $(\mathrm{ml})$ is often taken to be equal to $1 \mathrm{~cm}^{3}$. This practice is now deprecated.

- Symbol l. A unit of volume in the metric system regarded as a special name for the cubic decimetre. It was formerly defined as the volume of 1 kilogram of pure water at $4^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at standard pressure, which is equivalent to $1.000028~ \mathrm{dm}^{3}$.
