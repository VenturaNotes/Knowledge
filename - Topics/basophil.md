- (1) n. a variety of white blood cell distinguished by a lobed nucleus and the presence in its cytoplasm of coarse granules that stain purple-black with Romanowsky stains. Basophils are capable of ingesting foreign particles and contain histamine and heparin. There are normally 30-150 $\times 10^{6}$ basophils per litre of blood. See also POLYMORPH. 
- (2) (basophilic) adj. describing any cell that stains well with basic dyes. For example, certain cells in the anterior pituitary gland are basophilic.
## Source[^2]
- A type of white blood cell (leucocyte) that has a lobed nucleus surrounded by granular cytoplasm (see GRANULOCYTE). Basophils are produced continually by stem cells in the red bone marrow and move about in an amoeboid fashion. Normally present in very low numbers in the circulation, they may act in a similar manner to eosinophils in killing antibody-coated parasites. They accumulate with eosinophils at sites of allergic reactions and release histamine.
