- $n$. inflammation and secondary bacterial infection of the bile ducts due to biliary obstruction and stasis. Obstruction may be caused by gallstones, benign or malignant stricture, or intervention (such as ERCP). Symptoms include intermittent fever, usually with rigors; abdominal pain; and intermittent jaundice (a combination known as Charcot's triad). Treatment includes broad-spectrum antibiotics and decompression of the biliary tree to prevent recurrent infection. Liver abscesses may complicate cholangitis, and recurrent episodes of cholangitis can predispose to secondary biliary cirrhosis. Sclerosing cholangitis is an inflammatory disorder characterized by the progressive occlusion of intra- and extrahepatic bile ducts leading to stricture formation, liver cirrhosis, and subsequent liver failure. It is associated with ulcerative colitis and autoimmune disease.
