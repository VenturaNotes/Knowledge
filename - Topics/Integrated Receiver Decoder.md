- An Integrated Receiver/Decoder (IRD) is an electronic device collects a radio-frequency signal then decodes it, ensuring it's the correct format for an end-user device or display. This device, also known as a satellite receiver or satellite set-up box, can unscramble TV signals so users can watch all types of content. Other uses for IRDs include the ability to add closed captions or subtitles to content.
