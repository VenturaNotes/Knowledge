- Consider a dynamical system with generalized coordinates $q_1,q_2,...,q_n,$ solely acted on by conservative forces, with Lagrangian L. The action as the system moves from position at time $t_1$ to a position at time $t_2$ equals $$S = \int_{t_1}^{t_2}L(q,\dot q,t) \space dt$$The principle of least action states that a trajectory of the dynamical system is an actual motivation of the system if and only if the value of S is a stationary value.
