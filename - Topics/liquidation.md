- (winding-up) The distribution of a company's assets among its creditors and members prior to its dissolution. This brings the life of the company to an end. The liquidation may be voluntary (see CREDITORS' VOLUNTARY LIQUIDATION; MEMBERS' VOLUNTARY LIQUIDATION) or by the court (see COMPULSORY LIQUIDATION).

- The process of closing down a business and disposing of its assets. This may be done by selling it to a new owner as a going concern, or by selling off the various assets separately. The aim of liquidation is to produce as large as possible a sum of money, which can be used to pay off existing debts of the business, any remaining surplus being available for distribution to the owners or shareholders.
