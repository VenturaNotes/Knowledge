## Synthesis

- $n$. In philosophy, a property such as solidity, physical extension, shape, motion or rest, or number that is inherent in an object or a group of objects and is capable of being experienced directly by an observer. It is distinguished from a secondary quality, such as sound, colour, taste, smell, warmth, or cold that is merely a property capable of producing in an observer a sensation that does not correspond to the property itself. This distinction was first made by the Greek philosopher Democritus of Abdera (?460-?370 вс) and was accepted by the French philosopher René Descartes (1596-1650) and the English physicist and mathematician Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727) before being fully developed and given its most influential formulation in 1690 by the English philosopher John Locke (1632-1704) in his Essay Concerning Human Understanding (Book 2, Chapter 8).
