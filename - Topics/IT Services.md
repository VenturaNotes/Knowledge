- IT services is an umbrella term for any application of a companyâ€™s technological and computing expertise to enable day-to-day business operations. Unlike IT products (think concrete, tangible assets such as software applications or hardware), IT services focus on outcomes that can be measured with selected metrics. These KPIs (key performance indicators) may include higher revenue or improved customer acquisition rates. Companies that offer IT services work with clients to create, manage, and improve their business processes through the use of information technology. IT services vary widely, from hardware and software installation to cloud computing and cybersecurity. ITSM (IT service management) is the field concerned with implementing, delivering and managing IT services.
