- An atomic orbital that is part of the inner closed shell of an atom. Unlike the valence orbitals, which are the atomic orbitals of the valence shell of an atom, core orbitals on one atom have a small overlap with core orbitals on another atom. They are therefore usually ignored in simple calculations of chemical bonding.
