- $n$. the operation of implanting the ureters into the sigmoid colon (see URETEROENTEROSTOMY). This method of permanent urinary diversion may be used after cystectomy or to bypass a diseased or damaged bladder. The urine is passed together with the faeces, and continence depends upon a normal anal sphincter. The main advantage of this form of diversion is the avoidance of an external opening and appliance to collect the urine; the disadvantages include possible kidney infection, acidosis, and long-term development of cancer of the colon 20-30 years after the procedure.
