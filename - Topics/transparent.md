## Synthesis

- (1) Denoting a property or a component of a computer system that provides some facilities without restrictions or interference arising from the way it is implemented. For example, if a machine with 32-bit wide words has a 16-bit wide ALU yet performs correct 32-bit arithmetic, then the ALU size is transparent in such use. 
- (2) Denoting or using a transmission path that passes a signal, or some particular feature of a signal, without restricting or changing it. Note that nontransparent systems would not allow particular signals to be transmitted as data, reserving them for special purposes. See also DATA TRANSPARENCY.
