- $n$. a disease of the arteries in which fatty plaques develop on their inner walls, with eventual obstruction of blood flow. See ATHEROMA. â€”atherosclerotic adj.
## Source[^2]
- Obstruction of the arteries by localized deposits (plaques) of fatty material (including cholesterol) and fibrous tissue on their inner walls, which makes the walls less elastic and predisposes to the formation of blood clots (thrombi). Atherosclerosis is associated with high blood levels of cholesterol, particularly in the form of low-density lipoprotein; other risk factors include smoking, a sedentary lifestyle, and high blood pressure. It can result in coronary thrombosis and heart attack if it affects the coronary arteries (see CORONARY VESSELS).
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The major form of arteriosclerosis, involving sclerosis and thickening of the inner walls of the arteries through the deposit of cholesterol and other fatty substances. In the coronary arteries, this may lead to coronary heart disease; in the brain, to neurological impairments such as vascular dementia or multi-infarct dementia. \[From Greek athera porridge or gruel + sklerosis a hardening, from skleros hard + -osis indicating a process or state]
