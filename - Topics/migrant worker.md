- A worker who has come from another country or region to work. Attracted by better wages in the country or region to which they have migrated, such workers may or may not bring their family with them. In many cases they will not have done so and will therefore be sending a substantial proportion of their earnings back to their native country. This can have an adverse effect on the balance of payments of countries that attract substantial numbers of migrant workers and conversely can be advantageous to countries from which many workers migrate.
