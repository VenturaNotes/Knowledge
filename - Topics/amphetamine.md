A synthetic sympathomimetic drug that is often used as a street drug and as a medication to control the symptoms of narcolepsy in adults and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and hyperkinetic disorders in children, and that acts as a central nervous system stimulant, causing the release of noradrenalin (norepinephrine) and dopamine from noradrenergic and dopaminergic neurons and blocking the reuptake of dopamine, leading to feelings of euphoria that can last for several hours, with occasional unpleasant side-effects such as panic, anxiety, paranoia, and insomnia. Also called Benzedrine (trademark) or speed (street name). Formula: $\mathrm{C}_{9} \mathrm{H}_{13} \mathrm{~N}$.
