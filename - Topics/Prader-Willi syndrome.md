- (Prader-Willi-Labhart syndrome) a congenital condition that is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is due to an abnormality of chromosome 15 (see IMPRINTING). It is marked by pathological overeating and resulting obesity (affected children often subsequently develop type 2 diabetes), lethargy, short stature, a characteristic facial expression, learning disabilities, and underactivity of the testes or ovaries (hypogonadism) due to lack of pituitary gonadotrophins. It is a cause of delayed puberty. \[A. Prader, H. Willi, and A. Labhart (20th century), Swiss paediatricians]
