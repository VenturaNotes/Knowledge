- (Prader-Willi-Labhart syndrome) a congenital condition that is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait and is due to an abnormality of chromosome 15 (see IMPRINTING). It is marked by pathological overeating and resulting obesity (affected children often subsequently develop type 2 diabetes), lethargy, short stature, a characteristic facial expression, learning disabilities, and underactivity of the testes or ovaries (hypogonadism) due to lack of pituitary gonadotrophins. It is a cause of delayed puberty. \[A. Prader, H. Willi, and A. Labhart (20th century), Swiss paediatricians]

- $n$. A rare disorder (occurring in about one in 12,000-15,000 people of both sexes) usually caused by deletion, at or soon after conception, of several genes on the copy of chromosome 15 inherited from the father, resulting in hyperphagia, with a risk of morbid obesity. Other signs and symptoms include hypotonia, cognitive impairment, short stature and incomplete sexual development, obsessive or compulsive symptoms and tantrums. PWS abbrev. \[Named after the Swiss paediatricians Andrea Prader (1919-2001) and Heinrich Willi (1900-71) who first described it briefly in an article in the Schweizerische medizinische Wochenschrift in 1956 and more fully in a second article in the Journal of Pediatrics in 1963]
