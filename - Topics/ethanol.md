- (ethyl alcohol) A colorless water-soluble alcohol, $\mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}$. It is the active principle in intoxicating drinks, in which it is produced by alcoholic fermentation of sugar using yeast:$$\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6} \rightarrow 2 \mathrm{C}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{OH}+2 \mathrm{CO}_{2}$$The ethanol produced kills the yeast and fermentation alone cannot produce ethanol solutions containing more than $15 \%$ ethanol by volume. See also BREWING.
