- The principle, established in UK company law, that existing shareholders should be offered a proportion of certain classes of newly issued securities before they are offered to anyone else and upon terms that are at least as favorable. To satisfy this principle a company must write to every shareholder (see RIGHTS ISSUE), which may be an expensive and lengthy procedure. Newer methods of issuing shares, such as vendor placings or bought deals, are much cheaper and easier to effect, although they violate pre-emption rights. An issue of shares with no pre-emption rights can only be made if the shareholders have agreed to this in a special resolution. In the USA pre-emption rights have now been largely abandoned but controversy over the principle is still widespread in the UK.
