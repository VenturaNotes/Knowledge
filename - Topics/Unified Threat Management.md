- Unified threat management (UTM) is a common term used to discuss internet-based security efforts. Specifically, it refers to a security method provided by one application that achieves multiple security functions. This one application—such as an anti-virus program—should be capable of executing multiple protective services. This can include anti-phishing and anti-malware efforts, anti-virus support, and more.
