- (1) (worker co-operative) A type of business organization sometimes adopted in labor-intensive industries, such as agriculture, and often associated with socialist systems. Agricultural cooperatives have been encouraged in the developing countries, where individual farmers are too poor to take advantage of expensive machinery and large-scale production. In this case several farms pool resources to jointly purchase and use agricultural machinery. The principle has sometimes been extended to other industries, as when factory employees arrange a worker buy-out in order to secure threatened employment. The overall management of such co-operatives is usually vested in a committee of the employee-owners. 
- (2) (consumer co-operative) A movement launched in 1844 by 28 Rochdale weavers who combined to establish retail outlets where members enjoyed not only the benefits of good-quality products at fair prices but also a share of the profits (a dividend) based on the amount of each member's purchases.
