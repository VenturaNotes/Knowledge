- a difficult birth (see DYSTOCIA) in which the anterior or, less commonly, the posterior fetal shoulder impacts on the maternal symphysis or sacral promontory. It is an obstetric emergency and is diagnosed when the shoulders fail to deliver after the fetal head and when gentle downward traction has failed. Additional obstetric manoeuvres (e.g. McRobert's manoeuvre) are required to release the shoulders from below the pubic symphysis. It occurs in approximately $1 \%$ of vaginal births. There are well-recognized risk factors, such as maternal diabetes and obesity and fetal macrosomia. There can be a high perinatal mortality rate and morbidity associated with the condition; the most common fetal injuries are to the brachial plexus, causing an Erb's palsy or Klumpke's paralysis. Maternal morbidity is also increased, particularly postpartum haemorrhage.
