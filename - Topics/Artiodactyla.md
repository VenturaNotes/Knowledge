- An order of hooved mammals comprising the even-toed ungulates, in which the third and fourth digits are equally developed and bear the weight of the body. The order traditionally includes cattle and other ruminants (see RUMINANTIA), camels, hippopotamuses, and pigs. All except the last are herbivorous, having an elongated gut and teeth with enamel ridges for grinding tough grasses. Evidence from molecular studies now indicates that whales and dolphins are closely related to hippos and represent a lineage that split from ruminants about 55 million years ago; pigs are believed to have diverged even earlier. Hence whales plus members of the Artiodactyla are now placed in the superorder Cetartiodactyla. Compare PERISSODACTYLA.
