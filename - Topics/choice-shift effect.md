- The finding that after participating in a group discussion, individuals tend to advocate more extreme positions and call for riskier courses of action than they would have done had they not taken part in the discussion. This phenomenon is also known as the risky shift. More recently, certain experimental conditions have been found that lead group discussion to inhibit risk (a so-called cautious shift); as a result, the term 'choice-shift effect' is now sometimes applied to both effects.
