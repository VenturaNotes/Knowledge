- In some classifications, an assemblage of eukaryotic protists whose members have disc-shaped cristae in their mitochondria and are shown to be related by molecular systematics. They include the Euglenozoa (e.g. euglenids and kinetoplastids) and the Heterolobosea (amoebomastigotes and acrasid cellular slime moulds). The discicristates belong to the major group of protists called the excavates. See also DISCOMITOCHONDRIA.
