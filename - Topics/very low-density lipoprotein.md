- (VLDL) a lipoprotein that is the precursor of low-density lipoprotein (LDL). Containing triglycerides and cholesterol, it is produced in the liver and circulates in the bloodstream, where its triglycerides are hydrolysed to free fatty acids by lipoprotein lipase. The remaining lipoprotein becomes progressively denser and richer in cholesterol to form LDL.
