- $n$. the syndrome due to excessive amounts of thyroid hormones in the bloodstream, causing a rapid heartbeat, sweating, tremor, anxiety, increased appetite, loss of weight, and intolerance of heat. Causes include simple overactivity of the gland, a hormone-secreting benign tumour or carcinoma of the thyroid, and Graves' disease (exophthalmic goitre), in which there are additional symptoms including swelling of the neck (goitre) due to enlargement of the gland and protrusion of the eyes (exophthalmos). Treatment may be by surgical removal of the thyroid gland, radioactive iodine therapy to destroy part of the gland, or by the use of drugs (such as carbimazole or propylthiouracil) that interfere with the production of thyroid hormones. $\textemdash$thyrotoxic adj.
