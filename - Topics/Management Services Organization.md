- A management services organization (MSO) provides services to the medical and healthcare industries. An MSO helps manage administrative duties such as human resources, payroll, employee benefits, and compliance. MSOs are frequently used by physicians' offices, hospitals, investors, and groups of affiliated medical offices. The overall goal of using an MSO is to allow medical providers to focus on care instead of business duties such as coding, managing office spaces, IT services, financial management, and securing supplies and medications.
