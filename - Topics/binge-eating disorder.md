- $n$. An eating disorder, introduced in DSM-5, characterized by recurrent episodes of eating much more than normal within a two-hour period, with a feeling of loss of control, at least once a week for three months. Binge-eating episodes cause significant distress, may be associated with eating more quickly than normal, even when not hungry, often alone or in secret, and may be followed by guilt, self-disgust, and depression. The condition has similar signs and symptoms to bulimia nervosa but without the compensatory behavior intended to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting, misuse of laxatives or diuretics, enemas, fasting, or excessive exercise. \[Probably from Lincolnshire dialect English binge to soak]
