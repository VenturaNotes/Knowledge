- Let $S$ be a non-empty subset of $\mathbb{R}$. The real number $b$ is said to be an upper bound for $S$ if $s \leq b$ for every $s \in S$. If $S$ has an upper bound, then $S$ is bounded above. Moreover, $b$ is the supremum (or least upper bound) of $S$ if $b$ is an upper bound for $S$ and no upper bound for $S$ is less than $b$; this is written $b=\sup S$. For example, if $S=\{0.9,0.99,0.999, \ldots\}$ then $\sup S=1$. Note here that 1 is not itself in the set $S$. Similarly, the real number $c$ is a lower bound for $S$ if $c \leq s$ for every $s \in S$. If $S$ has a lower bound, then $S$ is bounded below. Moreover, $c$ is the infimum (or greatest lower bound) of $S$ if $c$ is a lower bound for $S$ and no lower bound for $S$ is greater than $c$; this is written $c=\inf S$. A set is bounded if it is bounded above and below. More generally, in a metric space $M$, a subset $S$ is bounded if $S$ is contained in some ball.
- Any non-empty set that is bounded above has a supremum$\textemdash$this is the completeness axiom of the real numbers$\textemdash$and likewise any non-empty set that is bounded below has an infimum.
