- deaths of women while pregnant or within 42 days of the end of the pregnancy from any cause related to, or aggravated by, the pregnancy or its management, but not from accidental or incidental causes. These deaths can be subdivided into four main categories: (1) direct deaths: directly related to pregnancy; (2) indirect deaths: due to pre-existing maternal disease aggravated by pregnancy; (3) coincidental: unrelated to pregnancy; (4) late deaths: occurring between six weeks and one year following delivery. See also MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE.
