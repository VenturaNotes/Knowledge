- The various states in which a computer system may be operating; these states have differing degrees of ability or privilege attached to them. There may be two or more states. In the simplest case there is a [[supervisor state]] (or executive state) and a [[user state]]. With more than two execution states at different levels, differing degrees of privilege may be granted. These states can represent some of the used resources in an access matrix. See also ACCESS CONTROL.
