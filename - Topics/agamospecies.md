- A species of organism in which sexual reproduction does not occur, represented typically as a collection of clones. Examples include many bacteria and some plants and fungi. The absence of sexual reproduction means that the biological species concept cannot be applied, and instead taxonomists must rely on identifying certain diagnostic traits and molecular systematics to distinguish between closely related asexual lineages. Consequently, the boundaries of agamospecies are often hard to define. See TYPOLOGICAL SPECIES CONCEPT.
