- $n$. surgical removal of the urinary bladder. This is necessary in the treatment of certain bladder conditions, notably cancer, and necessitates subsequent urinary diversion. The ureters draining the urine from the kidneys are reimplanted into an isolated segment of intestine (usually the ileum), which is brought to the skin surface as a spout (see ILEAL CONDUIT). Alternatively, in bladder replacement, a segment of ileum or colon is reconstructed to form a pouch (the Studer pouch is created from approximately 50 cm of ileum), which is anastomosed to the urethra and acts as a reservoir for the urine. Emptying may be achieved by abdominal straining or intermittent self-catheterization.
