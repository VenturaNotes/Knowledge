- $n$. the tissue that covers the external surface of the body and lines hollow structures (except blood and lymphatic vessels). It is derived from embryonic ectoderm and endoderm. Epithelial cells may be flat and scalelike (squamous), cuboidal, or columnar. The latter may bear cilia or brush borders or secrete mucus or other substances (see GOBLET CELL). The cells rest on a common basement membrane, which separates epithelium from underlying connective tissue. Epithelium may be either simple, consisting of a single layer of cells; stratified, consisting of several layers; or pseudostratified, in which the cells appear to be arranged in layers but in fact share a common basement membrane (see illustration). See also ENDOTHELIUM; MESOTHELIUM. $\textemdash$epithelial adj.

## Source[^2]
- (pl. epithelia) A tissue in vertebrates consisting of closely packed cells in a sheet with little intercellular material. It covers the outer surfaces of the body and walls of the internal cavities (coeloms) and is often underlain by a basement membrane. It also forms glands and parts of sense organs. Its functions are protective, absorptive, secretory, and sensory. The types of cell vary, giving rise to squamous epithelium; ciliated epithelium; cuboidal epithelium, with cube-shaped cells; and columnar epithelium, with rectangular cells (see also STRATIFIED EPITHELIUM). Epithelium is derived from ectoderm and endoderm. Compare ENDOTHELIUM; MESOTHELIUM.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A sheet of tissue of tightly bound cells only a few cells thick that is derived from the embryonic ectoderm and endoderm and that covers the outer surface of the body, the mucous membranes, and the lining of the gut, the retinas, and the glands. See also epidermis, nasal epithelium. Compare endothelium. epithelia pl. epithelial adj. \[From Greek epi on + thele a nipple]
