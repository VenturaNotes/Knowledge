- (BMI) the weight of a person (in kilograms) divided by the square of the height of that person (in metres): used as an indicator of whether or not a person is over- or underweight. For example, a person who is 1.7 m tall and weighs 65 kg has a BMI of $65 / 1.7^{2}=22.5$. A BMI of between 20 and 25 is considered normal, between 25 and 30 is overweight, and greater than 30 indicates clinical obesity. A BMI of less than 20 is considered underweight. A limitation of the BMI is that it cannot distinguish whether the weight is due to muscle or fat. BMI is not a valid metric in individuals with an altered body structure, as through physical disability. See also WAIST TO HIP RATIO.
