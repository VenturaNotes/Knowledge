- A reflex action that involves an electrical impulse being transferred from a sensory neuron to a motor neuron via at least one connecting neuron (interneuron) in the spinal cord. For example, stimulation of pain receptors in the skin initiates a withdrawal reflex, which involves several synapses with several motor neurons and results in the removal of the organism or part from the stimulus.
