## Source [^1]
- A reflex action that involves an electrical impulse being transferred from a sensory neuron to a motor neuron via at least one connecting neuron (interneuron) in the spinal cord. For example, stimulation of pain receptors in the skin initiates a withdrawal reflex, which involves several synapses with several motor neurons and results in the removal of the organism or part from the stimulus.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. Any reflex with more than one synapse (1), not counting the synapse between neuron and muscle, and hence involving one or more interneurons. In humans, all reflexes except stretch reflexes are polysynaptic. Compare MONOSYNAPTIC REFLEX. \[From Greek polys many + neuron a nerve]
