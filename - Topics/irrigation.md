## Source[^2]
- The provision of water for crops by artificial methods; for example by constructing ditches, pipe systems, and canals. Irrigation can lead to problems when the water leaches trace elements from the soil; selenium, for example, can be toxic to both local fauna and flora. Irrigation can also increase the salinity of the soil, if diverted rivers are used to provide the water. Evaporation of surface water leaves a crust of salt, which can drain down to deeper layers of the soil.
