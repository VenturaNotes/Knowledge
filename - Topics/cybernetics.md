- A discipline concerned with control and communication in animal and machine. Cybernetics attempts to build a general theory of machines independent of the material they are made from, e.g. electronic, organic, clockwork. Cybernetics draws an analogy between brains and electronic circuits. See also NEURAL NETWORK.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the science of communication processes and automatic control systems in both machines and living things: a study linking the working of the brain and nervous system with the functioning of computers and automated feedback devices. See also BIONICS.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The comparative study of automatic feedback and control processes in mechanical, electronic, and biological systems, especially processes in which negative feedback keeps the system in a particular state or on course towards a particular goal. The term was coined in 1947 by the US mathematician Norbert Wiener (1894-1964) and the Mexican neurophysiologist Arturo Rosenblueth (1900-70). See also closed-loop CONTROL, HOMEOSTASIS, OPEN-LOOP CONTROL, TOTE. cybernetic adj. \[From Greek kybernetes a steersman + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling, chosen in recognition of the fact that the first significant publication on feedback mechanisms was an article in 1868 on mechanical governors by the Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell (1831-79)]
