- A hierarchical structure of records, in which (a) a record at level $i$ holds data that is common to a set of records at level $i+1$ and (b) starting from the higher-level record, it is possible to access the set of lower-level records. Any record may only 'own' one set of lower-level records, and may only be a member of one such set. A data hierarchy may reflect 'real-world' hierarchical relationships, or may be a user view provided by a DBMS to facilitate a purpose or activity.
