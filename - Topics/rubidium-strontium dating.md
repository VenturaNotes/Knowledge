- A method of dating geological specimens based on the decay of the radioisotope rubidium-87 into the stable isotope strontium-87. Natural rubidium contains $27.85 \%$ of rubidium-87, which has a half-life of $4.7 \times \mathrm{M} ~10^{11}$ years. The ratio ${ }^{87} \mathrm{Rb} /{ }^{87} \mathrm{Sr}$ in a specimen gives an estimate of its age (up to several thousand million years).
