- A diagram that summarizes the energy levels and the allowed transitions between these energy levels in an atom. The energy is plotted vertically with a horizontal line for each energy level. The intensity of the transition can be represented on a Grotrian diagram by allowing the thickness of the line to represent the transition proportional to the intensity. Grotrian diagrams are named after the German spectroscopist Walter Grotrian (1890-1954), who invented them in 1928.
