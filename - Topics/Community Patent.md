- (unitary patent) A proposed European Union patent that is likely to become available by 2016; it will consist of a single, unitary, centrally enforceable patent to cover all the member states of the EU except Spain, Italy, and possibly Poland. The EU Community Patent is distinct from the current European Patent, which is granted under the European Patent Convention and does not have unitary effect.
