- n. 
- (1) (urinary incontinence) the inappropriate involuntary passage of urine, resulting in wetting. Stress incontinence is the loss of urine on exertion (e.g. coughing and straining). It is common in women in whom the muscles of the pelvic floor are weakened after childbirth. Urodynamic stress incontinence (formerly called genuine stress incontinence) in women is due to a simultaneous rise in bladder and abdominal pressure that exceeds urethral pressure without a contraction of the detrusor muscle of the bladder. Overflow incontinence is leakage from a full bladder, which occurs most commonly in elderly men with bladder outlet obstruction or in patients with neurological conditions affecting bladder control. Urge incontinence is leakage of urine that accompanies an intense desire to pass water with failure of restraint. It is frequently caused by detrusor instability. See also ENURESIS. 
- (2) (faecal incontinence, anal incontinence) inability to control bowel movements, causing involuntary loss of faeces or flatus.
