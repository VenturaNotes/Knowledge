- $n$. a substantial long-term restriction of functional ability or activity as a result of impairment of the body or mind. Most modern definitions of disability, including that supplied by the World Health Organization, recognize that it is a complex condition that includes a social dimension. In other words, an individual's experience of being disabled may in part reflect social and environmental factors that deny opportunities and full participation in society. See also HANDICAP.
