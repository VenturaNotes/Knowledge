- A holomorphic function $f:U \to \mathbb{C}$ on a connected, open subset (see open set) with zero set $f^{-1}(0)$ that has a limit point in $U$, is identically zero in $U$. This theorem is in stark contrast to real analysis and demonstrates how rigid holomorphic functions are in comparison with smooth real functions.
