- SCADA is a system used in manufacturing and industrial environments. These systems both maintain control over devices and equipment and record business-critical data. SCADA usually combines software and hardware elements. Hardware may include sensors, pumps, motors, or any moving parts of factory equipment. It could also include thermometers and moisture meters. Software is usually connectivity-driven or data analytical.
