- A hidden-line removal algorithm that is based on recursive subdivision of the scene until areas are obtained that are trivial to compute. The algorithm works because of area coherence. It solves the general problem by avoiding it. If the scene is simple enough to render then it is rendered; otherwise it is divided into smaller parts and the process is repeated.
