## Synthesis

- A ring network architecture configured on the basis that each station (node) on the ring awaits the arrival of a token from the adjacent upstream node, indicating that it is allowed to send information toward the downstream node. The network is configured in a manner that ensures that only a single token is present on the ring at one time. When a sending node intercepts the token, it first sends its message to the downstream node followed by the token, which is then passed to each succeeding node until it is again intercepted by a node with a message awaiting transmission. Token rings are defined by ISO standard 8802.5. Popular in the 1980s, they have since lost out in the marketplace to Ethernet.
