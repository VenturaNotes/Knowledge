- $n$. a genus of parasitic flagellate protozoans that move by means of a wavy membrane, bearing a single flagellum, projecting from the body surface. T. vaginalis often infects the vagina, where it may cause severe irritation and a foul-smelling discharge (see vaginitis), and sometimes also the male urethra; it can be transmitted during sexual intercourse. T. hominis and T. tenax live in the large intestine and mouth respectively. See also TRICHOMONIASIS.
