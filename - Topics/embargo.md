- A ban on some or all of the trade with one or more countries. A trade embargo is a form of economic sanction. Prominent examples include the continuing US embargo against Cuba and the former international ban on trade in arms with South Africa. Full embargos are rare and difficult to apply in practice.

- (1) A prohibition on trading with a country, generally or in some particular goods. A general embargo is intended as an expression of disapproval, for example of practices such as apartheid in South Africa; an embargo on particular products is generally based on defence considerations, to prevent the spread of advanced weaponry, for example during the Iraq-Iran war in the 1980s.
- (2) A prohibition on releasing or quoting published material until some deadline. This is generally intended to avoid political embarrassment or opportunities for insider trading by synchronizing the release of information through various channels.
