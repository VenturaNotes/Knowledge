- Let $f$ be a holomorphic function defined on an open set $U \subseteq \mathrm{c}$ and let $a \in U$. Then $f$ has derivatives of all orders and the $n$th derivative at $a$ is given by$$f^{(n)}(a)=\frac{n!}{2 \pi i} \int_{C} \frac{f(z)}{(z-a)^{n+1}} \mathrm{~d} z,$$where $C$ is a simple, closed, positively oriented, continuous, piecewise-smooth curve in $U$ and $a$ is inside $C$. When $n=0$ this result is known as Cauchy's integral formula. See also TAYLOR'S THEOREM.
