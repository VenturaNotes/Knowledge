- small groups of endocrine cells scattered through the material of the pancreas. There are three main histological types: alpha ( $\alpha$ ) cells, which secrete glucagon; beta ( $\beta$ ) cells, which produce insulin; and D cells, which release somatostatin and pancreatic polypeptide. \[P. Langerhans (1847-88), German physician and anatomist]
## Source[^2]
- (pancreatic islets) Small groups of cells in the pancreas that function as an endocrine gland. The $\alpha$ (or A) cells secrete the hormone glucagon, the $\beta$ (or B) cells secrete insulin, and the D cells secrete somatostatin. The islets are named after their discoverer, the German anatomist and microscopist Paul Langerhans (1847-88).
