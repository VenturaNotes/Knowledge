- $n$. Ambiguity arising from alternative ways of parsing a sentence or interpreting its structure. For example, a sentence such as Ann is married, and Bob is single, or Charles is divorced may mean that Ann is married and either Bob is single or Charles is divorced; or it may mean that either both Ann is married and Bob is single, or else Charles is divorced. Amphiboly cannot arise in formal logic, a provable result that is sometimes called 'unique readability'. Also called amphibology. amphibolies or amphibologies pl. amphibolic, amphibological, or amphibolous adj. \[From Greek amphibolos ambiguous, from amphi both ways + ballein to throw]
