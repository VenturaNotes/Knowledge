- $n$. A doctrine, first propounded by the German psychologist and philosopher Franz Brentano (1838-1917), according to which psychology should study not merely the elements of consciousness as in structuralism (2) but also mental acts and the way they are directed towards entities other than themselves. Brentano published his ideas in 1874 in his book Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt (Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint), and was an important forerunner of phenomenology. See also intentionality (1). Compare CONTENT PSYCHOLOGY.
