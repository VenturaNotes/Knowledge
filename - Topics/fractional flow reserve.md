- (FFR) a technique used to quantify the severity of a coronary artery narrowing. During cardiac catheterization, a specialized wire is passed down the coronary artery to measure pressure. The ratio of the pressure measured downstream of the narrowing to the pressure measured upstream is derived (this ratio also applies to coronary flow). When the ratio is below a certain threshold, flow restriction by the narrowing is deemed to be significant and percutaneous coronary intervention is likely to be beneficial.
