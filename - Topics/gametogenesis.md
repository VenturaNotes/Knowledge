- The processes involved in the formation of gametes. Gametes are normally formed by meiosis but sometimes by mitosis (as in the gametophyte generation of the ferns). In mammals gametogenesis in the female is known as oogenesis and occurs in the ovaries; in the male it is known as spermatogenesis and occurs in the testes.

- $n$. the process by which spermatozoa and ova are formed. In both sexes the precursor cells undergo meiosis, which halves the number of chromosomes. However, the timing of events and the size and number of gametes produced are very different in the male and female. See OOGENESIS; SPERMATOGENESIS.
