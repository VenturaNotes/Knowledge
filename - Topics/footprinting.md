- A technique for detecting regions where a protein is bound to DNA; for example, where a specific transcription factor is bound to the DNA of a gene. The protein protects the nucleic acid (i.e. the DNA) from digestion by a nuclease enzyme, so that after such treatment the undegraded DNA, the 'footprint', can be isolated and characterized.
