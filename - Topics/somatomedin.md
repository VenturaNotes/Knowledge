- $n$. a protein hormone, produced by the liver in response to stimulation by growth hormone, that stimulates protein synthesis and promotes growth. It is biochemically similar to insulin and has some actions similar to insulin; it is therefore sometimes said to have insulin-like activity (ILA) or is referred to as insulin-like growth factor (IGF).
