- (critical thermal maximum) The maximum body temperature that can be tolerated by an organism. When body temperature exceeds the upper critical point, cellular components and process become disrupted, and the organism eventually dies. For most animals the upper critical temperature lies in the range $30\text{-}45^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, while few plants can survive leaf temperatures in excess of $50^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, exceptions being desert plants such as agaves and cacti, which can tolerate temperatures of $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ or more. Some specialized prokaryotes, notably certain archaea, live near deep-sea vents at temperatures exceeding $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (see THERMOPHILIC). Compare LOWER CRITICAL TEMPERATURE.
