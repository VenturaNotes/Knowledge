- GINO-F (graphical input output) A package of Fortran subroutines for computer graphics. The GINO—F subroutines define a 'language' for the production of graphics, including three-dimensional objects viewed in various projections. GINO—F was a de facto graphics standard for many years, especially in the UK, but is now little used having been superseded by GKS and PHIGS.
