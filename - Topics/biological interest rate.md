- A rate of interest equal to the growth rate of population. In an overlapping generations economy with no capital and no storage the optimal allocation of consumption between generations is achieved when the interest rate is equal to the rate of population growth (hence the name 'biological'). The equality of interest rate and population growth rate is called the golden rule.
