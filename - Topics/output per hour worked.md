- A measure of output per unit of labour input. Output may be measured in physical quantities, or in value terms. Output per hour worked is used in comparisons of productivity in different plants, firms, or countries. Variations occur because of differences in the skill and experience of the labour force, the degree of effort, the amount and age of capital equipment, and the level of managerial competence and technical expertise.
