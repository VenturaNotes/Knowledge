- n. 
- (1) (in surgery) a strip of tissue dissected away from the underlying structures but left attached at one end so that it retains its blood and nerve supply in a pedicle. The flap is then used to repair a defect in another part of the body by suturing its free end into the area. When the flap has 'healed into' its new site the other end can be detached and the remainder of the flap can be sewn in, depending on the type of flap being used. Flaps are commonly used by plastic surgeons in treating patients who have suffered severe skin and tissue loss after mutilating operations (e.g. mastectomy; see TRAM FLAP) or after burns or injuries not amenable to repair by split skin grafting (see SKIN GRAFT). Skin flaps may also be used to cover the end of a bone in an amputated limb. In neurosurgery combined skin and bone (osteoplastic) flaps are commonly raised to provide access to the cranium. 
- (2) (in dentistry) a piece of mucous membrane and periosteum attached by a broad base. It is lifted back to expose the underlying bone and enable a procedure such as surgical extraction or apicectomy to be performed. It is subsequently replaced and stabilized using sutures during the healing period.
