- The parties to a lease. The landlord grants the lease to the tenant. The landlord may be the freehold owner of the land or may be a tenant of a superior landlord (see HEAD LEASE). The law of landlord and tenant is that governing the creation, termination, and regulation of leases. Many leases, both business and residential, are subject to statutory control. This means that the right of the landlord to end a lease and evict tenants may be restricted and the rent may be controlled. It is therefore essential to consider statutory rights when considering the relation between landlord and tenant, as well as those given by the lease.
