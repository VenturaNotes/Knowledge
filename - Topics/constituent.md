- $n$. A component part of a larger whole; in linguistics, a word, phrase, or clause forming part of a larger linguistic structure. For example, a sentence can be analyzed into its constituent subject and predicate, and each of these units can be analyzed further into their constituent parts. The results of such an analysis into constituents at different levels may be depicted by a phrase marker. \[From Latin constituens setting up, from constituere to establish, from con together + statuere to place]
