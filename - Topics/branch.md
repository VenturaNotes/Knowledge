- In [[version control system|version control systems]], a branch is a parallel version of a [[repository]]. It is contained within the repository but does not affect the primary or master branch, allowing you to work freely without disrupting the “live” version.
	- #question What does "parallel version" mean?
	- #question What is the difference between a primary branch and a master branch. Isn't the master branch supposed to be the primary branch? 
	- #question What is considered the "live" version? Why are there quotes around "live"?

- (1) A control structure in which one of two or more alternative sets of program statements is selected for execution. The selection is achieved during execution by means of a branch instruction; this instruction thus breaks the normal sequential program flow. (Branch instruction is usually regarded as synonymous with jump instruction.) See also CASE STATEMENT, GOTO STATEMENT, IF THEN ELSE STATEMENT, JUMP. 
- (2) The set of instructions selected for execution as a result of a branch instruction. 
- (3) To perform such a selection.

### Holomorphic Branch
- Given a multifunction $f$ on an open subset $U$ of $\mathbb{C}$, a holomorphic branch of $f$ is a holomorphic function on $U$ which selects from the possible choices of $f(z)$ for each $z \in U$. Essentially, the branch is a holomorphic choice of principal values for $f$. For example, every $z \in \mathbb{C}$ which is not a positive real can be written uniquely as $z=r e^{i \theta}$ on a cut plane where $r>0$ and $0<\theta<2 \pi$. A holomorphic branch for the complex logarithm on this cut plane is then $\log r+i \theta$. Note that 0 is a branch point and that there is a discontinuity across the positive real axis of $2 \pi i$.
### Of a Hyperbola
- The two separate parts of a hyperbola are called the two branches
