- The colorless liquid found within the lymphatic system, into which it drains from the spaces between the cells. Lymph (called tissue fluid in the intercellular spaces) resembles blood plasma, consisting mostly of water with dissolved salts and proteins. Fats are found in suspension and their presence varies with food intake. The lymph eventually enters the bloodstream near the heart.

- $n$. the fluid present within the vessels of the lymphatic system. It consists of the fluid that bathes the tissues, which is derived from the blood and is drained by the lymphatic vessels. Lymph passes through a series of filters (lymph nodes) and is ultimately returned to the bloodstream via the thoracic duct. It is similar in composition to plasma, but contains less protein and some cells, mainly lymphocytes.
