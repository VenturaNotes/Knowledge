- The process of resolving conflicts by removing or reconciling inconsistent values in a constraint network. A constraint network is a system of constraint equations and inequalities that represent the structure of a given problem. A crossword is an example of a constraint problem; the row/column sizes limit the choice of possible words and the interactions of rows and columns further constrain the solution.
- The first stage in constraint satisfaction is constraint propagation, where any dependencies between constraints are exploited to introduce more constraint and thus reduce the solution space. Then follows a search where variables are assigned values and matched against current constraints; this involves further constraint propagation and backtracking from failures. A solution is produced when a single set of values fits the final reduced set of constraints. An overconstrained problem will have no solution and an under-constrained problem may produce many alternative solutions.
