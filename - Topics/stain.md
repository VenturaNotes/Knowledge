- (1) n. a dye used to color tissues and other specimens for microscopical examination. In an acid stain the color is carried by an acid radical and the stain is taken up by parts of the specimen having a basic (alkaline) reaction. In a basic stain the color, carried by a basic radical, is attracted to parts of the specimen having an acidic reaction. Neutral stains have neither acidic nor basic affinities. A contrast stain is used to give color to parts of a tissue not affected by a previously applied stain. A differential stain allows different elements in a specimen to be distinguished by staining them in different colors. 
- (2) $v b$. to treat a specimen for microscopical study with a stain.
