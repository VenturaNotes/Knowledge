- Industrial internet of things (Industrial IoT or IIoT) platforms use smart sensors and actuators to gather real-time data to enhance industrial and manufacturing processes. IIoT is a set of integrated software capabilities that aggregates data from all the devices used in manufacturing into a centralized environment. These devices, which include hardware, software systems, sensors, and other data points, gather and share data, bridging the gap between systems, machines, and people.
