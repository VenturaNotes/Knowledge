- 'Cro-Magnon man' The name given to fossil hominins found at the cave site of CroMagnon, near the village of Les Eyzies in the Dordogne region of France. The remains, discovered in 1868, include the skeletons of four adults and a child and are representative of what are now termed Early Modern Humans. The Cro-Magnon fossils date from about 30000 years ago, but similar modern human fossils date back at least 42000 years in Europe. They display the characteristic traits of modern humans, including a tall rounded skull with a near vertical forehead and lack of a prominent brow ridge. Genetic evidence indicates that these European ancestors lived alongside and to some extent interbred with Neanderthals until the latter went extinct around 30000 years ago.
