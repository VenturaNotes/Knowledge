- Clipping refers to the loss of voice-related data caused by signal distortion within the operation of relevant voice-actuated devices. The distorted signal is the effect of a lack of adequate modulation. There are three primary types of clippings, namely hard digital clipping, soft or analogue clipping, and limiting. The first kind produces the most distortion, offering the highest volume but the biggest loss in terms of low bass. The soft clipping produces a smoother distortion with a bit more punch. Limiting grants the lowest distortion but with the largest loss of punch.
