- a list of the patients awaiting admission to hospital after having been assessed either as an out-patient or on a domiciliary consultation involving a specialist. In general the patients are offered places in the order in which their names were placed on the list, but in certain circumstances (e.g. if the condition is potentially dangerous or painful) the consultant may recommend urgent or even immediate admission. One of the variables recorded in relation to hospital admissions is the length of time between the name being placed on the list and the patient being admitted (waiting time). General practitioners may also request direct admission (immediate) for urgent cases who have not been seen by the consultant; such admission may be arranged by phone with the consultant or his or her deputy, or via the accident and emergency department of the hospital.
