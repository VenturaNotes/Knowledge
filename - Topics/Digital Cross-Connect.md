- DXC is a telecommunications term that refers to the electronic means by which two or more circuit-switched telephone networks are interconnected. In other words: DXC is what allows you to make calls from your phone to someone else's phone even if their network isn't the same as yours. DXC helps create a more global telecommunications infrastructure by allowing different networks to communicate with each other.
