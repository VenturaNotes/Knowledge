- (stagnant loop syndrome) a condition of stasis of the small intestine that alters the normal bacterial flora of the gut, leading to malabsorption, nutrient deficiency, and the passage of fatty stools (see STEATORRHOEA). It is usually a result of chronic obstruction (resulting, for example, from Crohn's disease, a stricture, or intestinal tuberculosis), or surgical bypass operations producing a stagnant length of bowel, or conditions (e.g. a jejunal diverticulum) in which a segment of intestine is out of continuity with the rest.
