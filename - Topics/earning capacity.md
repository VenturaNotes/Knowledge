- The potential earnings that an individual could obtain from engaging in paid employment. Earning capacity is determined by ability and training, where ability includes both inherent skills and physical endurance. Thus, disability or ill health can reduce earning capacity by limiting the length of time that can be worked within any given period. This should be contrasted to actual earnings, which are the outcome of individual choice on labour supply.
