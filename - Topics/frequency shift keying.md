- A method for representing digital data with analogue signals by using a change in the frequency of the carrier to represent information. It is thus a type of modulation. FSK with two frequencies, corresponding to the digital values 0 and 1 (see diagram) is the primary method used by low-speed modems. See also DIGITAL DATA TRANSMISSION.
