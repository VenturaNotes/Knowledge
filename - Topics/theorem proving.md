- The formal method of providing a proof in symbolic logic. It uses deductive inference. Each step in the proof will (a) introduce a premise or axiom; (b) provide a statement that is a natural consequence of previously established results using only legitimate rules of inference.
- Such formal proofs are often long and tedious. Sophisticated programs known as theorem provers can be used to automate much of the process. See also MECHANICAL VERIFIER.
