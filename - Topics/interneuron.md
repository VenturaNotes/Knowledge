- $n$. a neuron in the central nervous system that acts as a link between the different neurons in a reflex arc. It usually possesses numerous branching processes (dendrites) that make possible extensive and complex circuits and pathways within the brain and spinal cord.

- (interneurone) A relatively short neuron, which in vertebrates is confined to the grey matter of the central nervous system. In the spinal cord interneurons provide links between sensory neurons and motor neurons in polysynaptic reflexes, while in the brain they have a pivotal role in the integration of sensory inputs.
