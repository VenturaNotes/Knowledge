- (Lycophyta) A phylum of tracheophyte plants containing the clubmosses (genus Lycopodium) and related genera$\textemdash$including the spikemosses (Selaginella) and quillworts (Isoëtes)—as well as numerous extinct forms, which reached their peak in the Carboniferous period with giant coal-forming tree species. Lycophytes have roots and their stems are covered with numerous small leaves. Reproduction is by means of spores; the sporangia are usually grouped into cones. Phylogenetically, the lycophytes are the sister group to the euphyllophytes, which comprise all other vascular plants.
