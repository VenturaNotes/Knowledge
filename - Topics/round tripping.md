- (1) Any of various practices in which a company, A, sells an asset to a buyer, B (who is often in another jurisdiction) and then purchases an equivalent asset from $B$ at essentially the same price. The selfcancelling nature of the transaction is usually disguised by passing the assets through a chain of intermediaries. The object may be money laundering, tax evasion, or a desire to inflate the company's trading figures. 
- (2) A transaction in which a company borrows money from one source and lends it at profit to another by taking advantage of a short-term rise in interest rates or a regulatory anomaly. For example, a company may use its bank overdraft facility to deposit funds in the money market at rates that exceed the cost of the overdraft. This practice is frowned upon by banks because they may be having to use the money market themselves to fund their customers' overdrafts.
