- (1) Controls imposed by a government to restrict inflation. An income (pay) squeeze limits increases in wage and salaries, a credit squeeze limits the amounts that banks and other moneylenders can lend, a dividend (profits) squeeze restricts increases in dividends. 
- (2) Any action on a market that forces buyers to come into the market and prices to rise. In a bear squeeze (see BEAR) dealers holding a short position are forced to cover in order to deliver. It may be restricted to a particular commodity or security or a particular delivery month may be squeezed, pushing its price up against the rest of the market.
