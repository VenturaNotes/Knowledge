- (osteogenesis) $n$. the formation of bone, which takes place in three stages by the action of special cells (osteoblasts). A meshwork of collagen fibres is deposited in connective tissue, followed by the production of a cementing polysaccharide. Finally the cement is impregnated with minute crystals of calcium salts. The osteoblasts become enclosed within the matrix as osteocytes (bone cells). In intracartilaginous (or endochondral) ossification the bone replaces cartilage. This process starts to occur soon after the end of the second month of embryonic life. Intramembranous ossification is the formation of a membrane bone (e.g. a bone of the skull). This starts in the early embryo and is not complete at birth (see FONTANELLE).
