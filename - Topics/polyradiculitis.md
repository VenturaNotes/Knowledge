- (polyradiculopathy) $n$. any disorder of the peripheral nerves (see NEUROPATHY) in which the brunt of the disease falls on the nerve roots where they emerge from the spinal cord. An abnormal allergic response in the nerve fibres is thought to be one cause of this condition; the Guillain-Barr√© syndrome is an example. Other causes include infections (such as syphilis), herpesviruses, and tumours (such as lymphoma or other forms of cancer).
