- A genetic cross between parents that differ in the alleles they possess for one particular gene, one parent having two dominant alleles and the other two recessives. All the offspring (called monohybrids) have one dominant and one recessive allele for that gene (i.e. they are hybrid at that one locus). Crossing between these offspring yields a characteristic 3:1 (monohybrid) ratio in the following generation of dominant:recessive phenotypes. Compare DIHYBRID CROSS.
