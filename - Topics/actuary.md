- An expert who uses statistical records to predict the probability of future events. An actuary uses records of the occurrence of uncertain events, such as death at given ages, or fire, theft, and accidents involving cars, to predict how frequently similar events are likely to occur in the future. These predictions take account of observed trends in health or crime, as well as past facts. Actuarial expertise enables insurance companies to write policies with an expectation of making profits, without complete certainty.

- A person trained in the application of statistics and probability theory to questions of commercial risk. Some are employed by insurance companies to calculate probable lengths of life, and advise insurers on the amounts that should be put aside to pay claims and the amount of premium to be charged for each type of risk. Actuaries also advise on the administration of pension funds; the government actuary is responsible for advising the government on state pension schemes. See also Institute and Faculty of Actuaries.
