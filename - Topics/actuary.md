- An expert who uses statistical records to predict the probability of future events. An actuary uses records of the occurrence of uncertain events, such as death at given ages, or fire, theft, and accidents involving cars, to predict how frequently similar events are likely to occur in the future. These predictions take account of observed trends in health or crime, as well as past facts. Actuarial expertise enables insurance companies to write policies with an expectation of making profits, without complete certainty.
