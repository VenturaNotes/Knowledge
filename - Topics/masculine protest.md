- $n$. In individual psychology, a term introduced by the Austrian psychiatrist Alfred Adler (1870-1937) to denote a cluster of personality traits in either sex arising as overcompensations for feelings of inferiority and rejection of the feminine role. In later writings, Adler and his followers used the term more specifically to denote the rejection by women of the feminine role. Adler used the term for the first time in a paper read to the Viennese Psychoanalytic Society in 1911, and he developed and modified the concept further in his book Individual Psychology (1924), where he identified it as the main source of neuroses.
