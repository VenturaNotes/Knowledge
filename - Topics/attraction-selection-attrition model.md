- A theory holding that: (1) individuals are attracted to organizations whose members are similar to themselves in terms of personality, values, interests, and other attributes; (2) organizations are more likely to select those who possess knowledge, skills, and abilities similar to the ones their existing members possess; and (3) over time, those who do not fit in well are more likely to leave. Owing to these three factors, the personal characteristics of those who work for an organization are likely to become more similar over time, leading to the consolidation of organizational culture.
