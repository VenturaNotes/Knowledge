- (deprival value) In current cost accounting, the value of an asset taken as the lower of the replacement cost and the recoverable amount. The latter is the greater of the net realizable value and net present value. It is claimed that generally an asset should never be worth more to a business than its replacement cost, because if the business were deprived of the asset it would replace it. If an asset is not worth replacing it would be sold (net realizable value), unless the net present value were higher.
