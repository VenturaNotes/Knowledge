- Termination of employment by the employer sacking the worker for unsatisfactory conduct. Grounds for dismissal for cause could include incompetence, failure to obey instructions, absenteeism, dishonesty, drunkenness at work, or breach of health and safety regulations. Dismissal for cause is distinguished from redundancy, where there is no complaint about the employee, but the employer's need for labor has changed or ceased. A UK employee who disputes the existence or seriousness of the cause cited for dismissal can take a case of wrongful dismissal to an industrial tribunal.
