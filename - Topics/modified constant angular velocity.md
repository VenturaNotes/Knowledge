- A modification of CAV in which the rotation rate of the disk is constant but the clock rate and data transfer rate are varied in proportion to the radius of the track being accessed, thus obtaining the high data density of CLV without the long access time that usually goes with it. In practice the tracks are usually grouped into 4 to 8 bands; clock and data rates vary between bands but not within a band.
