- As defined by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the C-band is the portion of the electromagnetic spectrum within the microwave range with frequencies between 4 gigahertz (GHz) and 8 GHz. Other entities define the C-band slightly differently. For example, the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC) specifies that the C-band is between 3.7 and 3.98 GHz. This range is often used for satellite TV networks and feeds, as well as for Wi-Fi, mobile phones, surveillance appliances, and radar systems.
