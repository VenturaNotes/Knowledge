- Money of forms that qualify it to be used as commercial bank reserve assets. Such money is 'high-powered' because if the commercial banking system maintains a reserve ratio of $a$, an additional $£ 1 \mathrm{~m}$ of high-powered money allows total deposits to expand by $£(1 / a) \mathrm{m}$. It is a belief of monetarists that if the central bank controls 'base' or highpowered money, the rest of the money supply will adapt automatically.
