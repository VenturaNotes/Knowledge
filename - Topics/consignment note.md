- A document accompanying a consignment of goods in transit. It is signed by the consignee on delivery and acts as evidence that the goods have been received. It gives the names and addresses of both consignor and consignee, details the goods, usually gives their gross weight, and states who has responsibility for insuring them while in transit. It is not a negotiable document (compare BILL OF LADING) and in some circumstances is called a way bill.
