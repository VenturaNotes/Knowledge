- $n$. limping. Intermittent claudication is a cramping pain, induced by exercise and relieved by rest, that is caused by an inadequate supply of blood to the affected muscles. It is most often seen in the calf and leg muscles as a result of atheroma of the leg arteries. The leg pulses are often absent and the feet may be cold. The treatment is that of atheroma.
