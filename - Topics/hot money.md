- (1) Money that moves at short notice from one financial centre to another in search of the highest short-term interest rates, for the purposes of arbitrage, or because its owners are apprehensive of some political intervention in the money market, such as a devaluation. Hot money can influence a country's balance of payments.
- (2) Money that has been acquired dishonestly and must therefore be untraceable.
