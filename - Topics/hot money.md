## Source [^1]
- (1) Money that moves at short notice from one financial center to another in search of the highest short-term interest rates, for the purposes of arbitrage, or because its owners are apprehensive of some political intervention in the money market, such as a devaluation. Hot money can influence a country's balance of payments.
- (2) Money that has been acquired dishonestly and must therefore be untraceable.
## Source[^2]
- Money in bank balances or liquid securities which is liable to rapid removal to other countries if the holders suspect that the currency will depreciate. An inflow of hot money may make a country's balance-of-payments situation look satisfactory, but also makes it subject to sudden deterioration.
