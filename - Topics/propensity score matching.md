- A method of estimation of the causal effect of a treatment, or a policy intervention, in observational data. The method is based on the comparison of the outcomes for two samples, those who did and those who did not receive the treatment, who are otherwise closely comparable, or matched, on a set of observed characteristics. The intention is to approximate a fully randomized experiment in a non-experimental setting.
