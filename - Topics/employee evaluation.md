- A formal assessment of an employee's performance in his or her job, as measured by certain objective indicators (e.g. sales figures, absenteeism) or by more subjective rating procedures. The employee may be evaluated in absolute terms or by comparison with others doing similar work, as in the paired comparison method. The results are usually presented to the employee as part of his or her performance appraisal.
