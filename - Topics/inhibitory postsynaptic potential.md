## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (IPSP) The electric potential that is generated in a postsynaptic neuron when an inhibitory neurotransmitter (such as gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released into the synapse and causes a slight increase in the potential difference across the postsynaptic membrane (hyperpolarization). This makes the neuron less likely to transmit an impulse. Compare EXCITATORY POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIAL.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A graded hyperpolarization or increase in the electrical potential across the membrane of a postsynaptic neuron, occurring in response to a signal transmitted across a synapse (1) by a presynaptic neuron and reducing the propensity of the postsynaptic neuron to initiate a nerve impulse. Also called postsynaptic inhibition. See also ACTION POTENTIAL, RESTING POTENTIAL. Compare EXCITATORY POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIAL. IPSP abbrev.
