- (IPSP) The electric potential that is generated in a postsynaptic neuron when an inhibitory neurotransmitter (such as gamma-aminobutyric acid) is released into the synapse and causes a slight increase in the potential difference across the postsynaptic membrane (hyperpolarization). This makes the neuron less likely to transmit an impulse. Compare EXCITATORY POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIAL.
