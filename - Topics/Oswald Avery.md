- (1877-1955) Canadian bacteriologist who worked at the Rockefeller Institute Hospital in New York (1913-48), where he and his colleagues Maclyn McCarty and Colin Macleod identified DNA as the hereditary material in the cells of pneumococcus bacteria. It had previously been thought that protein was the hereditary material; Avery's work was an important step in leading Watson and Crick to the discovery of the true chemical basis of heredity.
