In the doctrine of associationism, the most basic law, introduced by the Scottish philosopher James Mill (1773-1836), according to which mental elements or ideas become associated when they are close to one another in time or space.

Compare FREQUENCY LAW, SIMILARITY LAW. \[From Latin contigere to touch on all sides, from con- wholly + tangere to touch]
