- $n$. (pl. microvilli) one of a number of microscopic hairlike structures (about $5 ~\mu \mathrm{m}$ long) projecting from the surface of epithelial cells (see EPITHELIUM). They serve to increase the surface area of the cell and are seen on absorptive and secretory cells. In some regions (particularly the intestinal tract) microvilli form a dense covering on the free surface of the cells: this is called a brush border.
## Source[^2]
- (pl. microvilli) One of a number of minute finger-like projections on the free surfaces of epithelial cells. Microvilli are covered with plasma membrane and their cytoplasm is continuous with the main cell cytoplasm. Their purpose is to increase the absorptive or secretory surface area of the cell, and they are abundant on the villi of the intestine, where they form a brush border.
