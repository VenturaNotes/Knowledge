## Synthesis
- Agile is a broad philosophy/mindset for iterative project development.
- #question What is the agile manifesto?
### Organize
- Agile is an iterative approach to software development that allows teams to deliver value to customers faster (than traditional, sequential development methodologies like the [[waterfall model]]) through small increments.
	- Value is typically defined from the customer's perspective which could be
		- A benefit to the end-user or stakeholder
			- #question Is the end-user or stakeholder more important? Is this company dependent? Does it make a difference if it's a for profit vs nonprofit company? 
		- Solves a problem
			- #question Is this a customer perspective?
		- Achieves a business objective
			- #question Is this a customer perspective?
	- Functional features (new capabilities or user stories) are a primary way to deliver value, it can also come from
		- Improving existing features
			- #question What is an example of a feature?
		- Enhancing performance
			- #question Give an example
		- Reducing bugs
			- #question Give an example
		- Improving user experience
			- #question Give an example
		- #question What are user stories?
		- #question I don't think saying 'functional features' is correct. I think functions and features are separate things. When you say that functional features are specific actions, tasks, or behaviors that a system or software component is designed to perform for the user, you're thinking of the term,  functional requirements. 
- Characterized by:
	- [[Iterative Development]]
	- [[Incremental Delivery]]
	- Collaboration: Emphasizes close collaboration between self-organizing, cross-functional teams and their customers
		- Self-organizing is when the team members work and manage their tasks without being directed by a manager
	- Flexibility and Adaptability: Agile methods are designed to respond to change rather than rigidly follow a plan.
	- Customer Focus: Prioritizes delivering value to the customer and incorporating their feedback throughout the development process.
		- #question What is the development process?
### Agile Methodologies
- Common Agile methodologies include:
	- [[Scrum]]
	- [[Kanban]]
	- [[Lean Software Development]]
	- [[Extreme Programming]] (XP)
	- [[Feature-Driven Development]]
- Sometimes organizations might use a single framework from above or combine elements from different frameworks calling it "hybrid Agile" or "[[Scrumban]]"
### Development Process
- This refers to the continuous cycle of planning, executing, reviewing, and adapting that occurs throughout the project lifecycle. It's not a single, linear process but an iterative loop:
	- Envision/Plan: Define high-level goals and initial requirements ([[Product Backlog]]).
		- #question What is a high-level goal?
	- Iterate/Execute (Sprints):
		- Sprint Planning: Select and plan work for the current iteration.
		- Develop & Test: Build the selected features.
		- Daily Stand-up: Synchronize and address impediments.
- Review & Adapt:
	- Sprint Review: Demonstrate completed work to stakeholders and gather feedback.
	- Sprint Retrospective: Reflect on the process and identify improvements.
	- This cycle repeats until the product is complete or no longer needed.

### Organize
- #question Isn't Lean a waterfall method? And what is the waterfall workflow that is no longer used by industry?
	- No, Lean is not a Waterfall method. Lean Software Development is a core Agile methodology, focusing on efficiency, waste reduction, and continuous improvement, which are antithetical to the rigid, sequential nature of Waterfall.
	- The Waterfall workflow is a traditional, linear, sequential project management approach. It breaks down project activities into distinct phases, where each phase must be completed and signed off before the next phase can begin. The typical phases are:
		- Requirements: All project requirements are gathered and documented upfront.
		- Design: The system architecture and design are created based on the requirements.
		- Implementation (Coding): The software is developed according to the design.
		- Verification (Testing): The completed software is tested to ensure it meets the requirements.
		- Deployment (Installation): The software is released to users.
		- Maintenance: Ongoing support and updates.
	- The Waterfall model is largely no longer used by industry for complex software projects because:
		- It's inflexible and resistant to change; requirements are locked in early, making it difficult to adapt to evolving needs.
		- Feedback from users comes very late in the process, often after significant investment, leading to a higher risk of delivering the wrong product.
		- It assumes that all requirements can be perfectly understood and documented at the beginning, which is rarely the case in real-world software development.
		- It can lead to long development cycles before any working software is available.
		- While it might still be used for very small, simple, and well-understood projects with stable requirements, Agile and other iterative methods have largely replaced it for most modern software development.
