- Acts of the UK parliament in 1990 and 2008, establishing and amending principles for the legal supervision, by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, of the creation, use, and storage of human embryos outside the body and of their use in treatment and research. The 2008 amendments included a ban on sex selection for social reasons, recognition of same-sex couples as potential legal parents, and regulations related to developing areas of research using embryos. The 1990 Act had also reduced the legal time limit for most abortions from 28 weeks gestation (as in the 1967 Abortion Act) to 24 weeks. Interpretation and regulation of principles and practice in this rapidly developing area of research and practice continue and are often controversial.
