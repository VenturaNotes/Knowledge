- (1) The representation of a security on a recognized stock exchange (see LISTED COMPANY). A quotation allows the shares of a company to be traded on the stock exchange and enables the company to raise new capital if it needs to do so (see FLOTATION; LISTING REQUIREMENTS; RIGHTS ISSUE). 
- (2) An indication of the price at which a seller might be willing to offer goods for sale. A quotation does not, however, have the status of a firm offer. 
- (3) A bid and offer price indicated by a dealer in financial obligations.
