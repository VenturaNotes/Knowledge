## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A transistor fabricated from an extremely thin film of amorphous (noncrystalline) silicon, or sometimes from a more responsive material. TFT technology is employed, for example, in active-matrix LCDs where the thin-film circuitry is deposited on a glass substrate in the screen and is used to control individual pixels. Monitors based on this technology have largely replaced cathode-ray tube monitors in recent years.
