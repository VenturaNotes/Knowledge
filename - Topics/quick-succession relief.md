- Relief available when the same property is assessed for inheritance-tax purposes in the estates of two separate individuals, the second of whom dies within 5 years of the first. For example, B inherits property from A, which was subject to inheritance tax on A's death of $£ X$. If $B$ dies within one year of the date of the gift, the inheritance tax, $£ X$, that was paid on A's estate will be allowed in full against the inheritance-tax liability on B's estate. If B dies within 1-2 years after the date of A's death the relief is $80 \%$ of $£ X$, within $2-3$ years relief is $60 \%$ of $£ X$, within $3-4$ years relief is $40 \%$ of $£ X$, and within $4-5$ years relief is $20 \%$ of $£ X$. The relief is deducted from the whole estate, not simply a particular part of it.
