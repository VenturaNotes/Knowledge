- A macro package built on top of TeX. LaTeX implements a form of descriptive markup system, in which the user specifies the function of each piece of text (heading, paragraph, footnote, etc.) but not its printed appearance. The actual layout is defined in a collection of style files, thus ensuring uniformity of appearance and conformity to house style. LaTeX hides much of the complication of TeX from the user, and is widely used in the academic community as a way of producing typeset research papers and reports.
## Source[^2]
- A sticky, milky fluid of mixed composition produced by about $10 \%$ of flowering plants. It has no known metabolic function and is thought to serve as a defence against insects and other herbivores that feed on the plant. Latex is produced in specialized cells called lactifers and accumulates at the point of damage on the leaf or stem. Insects may become trapped in the sticky exudate or succumb to one of the many bioactive substances that can be found in latex, including alkaloids, cardiac glycosides, phenolics, and terpenes. The latex of some species, notably rubber trees, is collected for commercial purposes.
