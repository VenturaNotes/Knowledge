- (zonula adherens) A type of cell junction, found especially in epithelial cells, that forms a strengthening and interlocking belt encircling the exterior of adjacent cells. It consists of a band of cadherin molecules (see CELL ADHESION MOLECULE) on the outside of the transverse cell surface, which are linked through the plasma membrane to a circumferential belt of actin microfilaments inside the cell. The cadherin bands of neighbouring cells are interlocked, thus contributing to the stability and integrity of the cell layer. Compare TIGHT JUNCTION.
