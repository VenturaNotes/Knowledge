- $n$. The principle formulated by the US physiological psychologist Karl Spencer Lashley (1890-1958) that different regions of the cerebral cortex are equally involved in performing specific functions and have the capacity to take over functions from other regions that are damaged. This principle is now known to be true only within limits, there being a great deal of localization of function in the brain. See also mass ACTION.
