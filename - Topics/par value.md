- (face value; nominal value) The nominal price of a share or other security. If the market value of a security exceeds the nominal price it is said to be above par; if it falls below the nominal price it is below par. Gilt-edged securities are always repaid at par (usually $Â£ 100$ ), i.e. at the par value.
