- Movement of foreign nationals to reside in a country; this does not include people on short visits, for business, study, or as tourists. Immigrants may arrive with the intention of permanent settlement, arrive with the intention of returning home after a prolonged stay, or be uncertain at the time of arrival how long they will wish to stay. Immigration is motivated by 'push' and 'pull' factors. Push factors could be poverty or persecution in the country migrants are leaving; pull factors could be economic opportunity or freedom in the country they move to.
