- (ILR) a device, inserted beneath the skin of the chest, to record the heart rhythm for up to two years. It is usually used for the investigation of patients presenting with infrequent syncope (fainting) in whom arrhythmia is the suspected cause. When syncope occurs, the device can be examined using wireless technology to reveal the heart rhythm at the time of the episode.
