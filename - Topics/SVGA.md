- (SuperVGA) A color graphics adapter that was originally the upgrade of the original pixel VGA (video graphics array) standard. It generated $800 \times 600$ pixels with 16 colors. However, the term quickly lost this precise meaning, and many subsequent graphics adapters with far higher resolutions and color depths have been described as 'SVGA'.
