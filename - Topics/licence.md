- (1) Official permission to do something that is forbidden without a licence (e.g. sell alcohol or own a TV or a firearm). Licences may be required for social reasons or simply to enable revenue to be collected. Since the Consumer Credit Act 1974 all businesses involved with giving credit to purchasers of goods must be licensed by the Office of Fair Trading. 
- (2) Formal permission to enter or occupy land. Such licenses are of three kinds. (a) The simplest gives the licensee the permission of the landowner to be on land (e.g. the right of a visitor to enter a house). It may be revoked at any time. (b) Contractual licences are permissions to be on land in the furtherance of some contractual right (e.g. the right of the holder of a cinema ticket to be in the cinema). (c) Licences coupled with an interest are those that go with a recognizable interest in the land of another. Such licences are irrevocable and assignable. 
- (3) See FRANCHISE. 
- (4) A carrier's licence.
