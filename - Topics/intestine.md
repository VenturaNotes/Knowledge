- (bowel, gut) $n$. the part of the alimentary canal that extends from the stomach to the anus. It is divided into two main parts $\textendash$ the small intestine and the large intestine. The small intestine is divided into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. It is here that most of the processes of digestion and absorption of food take place. The surface area of the inside of the small intestine is increased by the presence of finger-like projections called villi (see illustration). Glands in the mucous layer of the intestine secrete digestive enzymes and mucus. The large intestine consists of the caecum, vermiform appendix, colon, and rectum. It is largely concerned with the absorption of water from the material passed from the small intestine. The contents of the intestines are propelled forwards by means of rhythmic muscular contractions (see PERISTALSIS). —intestinal adj.
