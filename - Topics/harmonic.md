- $n$. A component of a complex tone, having a frequency that is an integral multiple of the fundamental frequency. The first harmonic is the fundamental tone; the second harmonic, also called the first overtone, has twice the frequency of the fundamental and is therefore an octave higher; the third harmonic or second overtone has three times the frequency of the fundamental; and so on (see illustration). See also missing FUNDAMENTAL ILLUSION. \[From Latin harmonicus of or relating to harmony]

## Source[^2]
- An oscillation having a frequency that is a simple multiple of a fundamental sinusoidal oscillation. The fundamental frequency of a sinusoidal oscillation is usually called the first harmonic. The second harmonic has a frequency twice that of the fundamental, and so on.
