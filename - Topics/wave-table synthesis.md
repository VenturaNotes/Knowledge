- A technique for reproducing a wide frequency range from a small number of original samples at selected base frequencies. It is often used to create in a more accurate way the sounds of real musical instruments by means of a number of sound cards. Data is either held in ROM or loaded into RAM. The specialized hardware then performs interpolation from various base notes held in RAM or ROM. The technique is often used by on-board MIDI systems.
