- $n$. The tendency of human judges to overweight outcomes that are certain relative to outcomes that are merely probable. Thus, if given a choice between $\$ 1,000$ and gamble in which a fair coin is tossed and the prize is $\$ 2,010$ if the coin falls heads and nothing if it falls tails, most people prefer the certainty of $\$ 1,000$, although the expected value of the gamble is $\$ 1,005$. This phenomenon arises from risk aversion.
