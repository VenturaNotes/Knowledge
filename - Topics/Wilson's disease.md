- an inborn defect of copper metabolism in which there is a deficiency of caeruloplasmin (which normally forms a nontoxic complex with copper). It is inherited as an autosomal recessive characteristic. The free copper may be deposited in the liver, causing jaundice and cirrhosis, or in the brain, causing learning disabilities and symptoms resembling parkinsonism. There is a characteristic brown ring in the cornea (the Kayser-Fleischer ring). If the excess copper is removed from the body by regular treatment with penicillamine both mental and physical deficits tend to improve. Medical name: hepatolenticular degeneration. \[S. A. K. Wilson (1878-1936), British neurologist]
