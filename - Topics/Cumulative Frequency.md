- The sum of the frequencies of all the values up to a given value. If the values $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, in ascending order, occur with frequencies $f_1, f_2, ...,f_n$, respectively, then the cumulative frequency at $x_i$ is equal to $f_1 + f_2 + \cdots + f_i$. Cumulative frequencies may be similarly obtained for grouped data.
