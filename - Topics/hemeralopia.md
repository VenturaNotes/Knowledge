- $n$. A form of partial blindness in which bright light causes blurring of vision, resulting from a malfunction of the photopic visual system, often as a side-effect of anticonvulsant medication prescribed for people with epilepsy. The term is sometimes misapplied to nyctalopia, but this is avoided in careful usage. Also called day blindness. Compare nyctalopia. \[From Greek hemera day + alaos blind + ops an eye + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
