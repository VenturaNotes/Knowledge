- (SERM) a drug that has oestrogen-like activity in some tissues and an anti-oestrogenic effect in others, depending on the manner of its binding with the oestrogen receptors. Tamoxifen was the first SERM to be introduced. Because of its activity as an anti-oestrogen it is used in the treatment of breast cancer, but its oestrogenic activity may cause side-effects. Raloxifene is used in the treatment of osteoporosis for its oestrogenic effects on bone density.
