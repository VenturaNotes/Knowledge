- An expected future cost that varies with alternative courses of action. Decision making involves choosing between such alternatives, and to make the best choice a manager needs to identify the future cash flows for each decision. Costs that have already been incurred as a result of past decisions (sunk costs) are not relevant for decision making. Likewise, a future cost that will not be changed by a decision is irrelevant to that decision. See DIFFERENTIAL ANALYSIS.
- An understanding of relevant costs is particularly important for the following types of decision:
	- special selling-price decisions;
	- product-mix decisions when capacity constraints exist;
	- decisions on replacement of equipment;
	- outsourcing (make or buy) decisions;
	- decisions on whether to drop a product or close a department.
