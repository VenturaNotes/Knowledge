- $n$. The cognitive level at which a stimulus is analyzed. For example, the word clock, presented as a visual stimulus, may be perceived as a collection of black marks on white paper, or as a string of five letters, or as a word with a corresponding pronunciation, or it may evoke a mental representation of a complicated mechanism capable of keeping time, each of these responses representing a greater depth of processing than its predecessor. See LEVELS OF PROCESSING.
