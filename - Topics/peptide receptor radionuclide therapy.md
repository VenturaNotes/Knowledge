- (PRRT) a type of radiotherapy used to treat neuroendocrine tumours (NETs; see NEUROENDOCRINE SYSTEM). A radionuclide is combined with a relevant peptide to create a so-called radiopeptide, which is injected into the patient's bloodstream. Because NETs have an overexpression of peptide receptors, the radiopeptide binds to the tumour, delivering a high dose of radiation directly to the cancer cells. The chief merit of PRRT is this ability to target delivery of radionuclides for highly localized treatment. A similar technique, using a gamma emitter as the radionuclide, can be used for locating and imaging NETs.
