- Agreements between traders that are not considered to be in the public interest. Under the Competition Act 1998 any agreement between two or more suppliers of goods or services restricting prices, conditions of sale, quantities offered, processes, areas and persons to be supplied, etc., must be entered in a public register and, where appropriate, investigated by the Office of Fair Trading. Such agreements are presumed to be contrary to the public interest unless the parties are able to prove to the court that the agreement is beneficial.
