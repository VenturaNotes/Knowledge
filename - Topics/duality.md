- The property exhibited by the laws and rules of set algebra, the propositional calculus, and Boolean algebra that each law or rule has a dual law or rule, constructed by the simultaneous replacement of each occurrence of 0 by 1,1 by $0, \vee$ by $\wedge$, and $\wedge$ by V. Such a pair of laws or rules is then said to be self-dual. Thus de Morgan's laws, for example, are self-dual.
- If a law or rule contains the partial ordering $\leq$ inherent in any lattice, then in obtaining duals this should be replaced by $\geq$ and vice versa; thus inequalities should be reversed.
