- The property exhibited by the laws and rules of set algebra, the propositional calculus, and Boolean algebra that each law or rule has a dual law or rule, constructed by the simultaneous replacement of each occurrence of 0 by 1,1 by $0, \vee$ by $\wedge$, and $\wedge$ by V. Such a pair of laws or rules is then said to be [[self-dual]]. Thus de Morgan's laws, for example, are self-dual.
- If a law or rule contains the partial ordering $\leq$ inherent in any lattice, then in obtaining duals this should be replaced by $\geq$ and vice versa; thus inequalities should be reversed.
## Source[^2]
- The idea that there are multiple ways of viewing a single issue. More formally, duality applied to optimization theory states that every maximization problem has a dual minimization problem and vice versa. Any problem can be transformed into its dual by interchanging constraints and objectives. In consumer theory the problem of maximizing utility subject to a budget constraint is dual to minimizing expenditure subject to achieving a given level of utility. The use of duality provides alternative ways to represent the solution. For example, the expenditure function and the indirect utility function are equivalent representations of consumer behavior.
