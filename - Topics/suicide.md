- $n$. deliberately causing one's own death. A distinction is usually drawn between attempted suicide, when death is averted although the person concerned intended to kill himself (or herself), and other forms of deliberate self-harm, when the harm is inflicted for reasons other than actually killing oneself. Following the Suicide Act 1961, suicide is not a criminal offence in the UK, but it remains a criminal offence for a person to aid, abet, counsel, or procure the suicide of another (see ASSISTED SUICIDE). There is good evidence that asking about suicidal thoughts and especially plans is important in the management of depression: and no mention or attempt should be dismissed without appropriate assessment and help, especially in vulnerable groups, such as teenagers or the isolated elderly. Charities such as Samaritans have a vital role to play. See also AUTONOMY.
