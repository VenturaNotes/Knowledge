- n. Tying, securing, or constraining. In psychoanalysis, an operation tending to restrict the flow of libidinal energy, usually by the ego exerting a restraining influence on the primary process. For example, in an article on 'Project for a Scientific Psychology', published in 1895, Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) cited the example of a painful memory that needs to be tamed: 'particularly large and repeated binding from the ego is required before this facilitation to unpleasure can be counterbalanced' (Standard Edition, I, pp. 177-397, at pp. 380-1). Freud developed the idea further in his book Beyond the Pleasure Principle (1920, Standard Edition, XVIII, pp. 7-64), and in An Outline of Psycho-Analysis (1938/40, Standard Edition, XXIII, pp. 144-207, at p. 148) he described binding as a preservative operation that is a primary aim of Eros, in contrast to Thanatos, whose primary aim is to destroy things. See also bound ENERGY.
