- The creation and experience of environments. The central objective is to place the participant in an environment that is not normally or easily experienced. [[Augmented reality]] is similar to virtual reality but the virtual image is superimposed on a real-world image often using see-through head-mounted displays.
## Source[^2]
- Virtual reality (VR) is a technology that uses computer graphics and 360-degree videos to create a simulated reality. Businesses who employ VR have discovered new ways to engage their employees, potential leads, and existing customers. The most popular business applications for VR are for training employees. VR is also implemented when training pilots, truck drivers, and even medical professionals, due to it's low-risk, yet realistic environment.
## Source[^3]
- (VR) A computer modelling system capable of creating three-dimensional simulated environments that give the user the experience of being inside, and interacting with, the environment being modelled. Used as part of computer-aided design systems, VR enables customers to view new products without the expense of creating prototypes. Building layouts, for example, can be optimized by allowing customers to 'walk through' the VR model. Most systems allow them to move elements of the design, with any modifications (e.g. repositioned doors) being translated into new drawings and blueprints. VR can also be used to train staff without exposing them to hazardous conditions.
