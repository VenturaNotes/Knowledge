- In the U.S. workforce, a furlough is a temporary, involuntary, and unpaid leave of absence for an employee. Unlike a layoff or termination, the company still employs the individual and the employee keeps their benefits but does not receive a paycheck. The employee is not allowed to do any work while on furlough.
