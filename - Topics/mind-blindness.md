- $n$. A specific inability to appreciate other people's mental states. The term was first used in its modern sense in 1990 by the British psychologist Simon Baron-Cohen (born 1958), although the German physiologist Hermann Munk (1839-1912) introduced it (in the German form Seelenblindheit) in an article in the Archiv f√ºr Anatomie und Physiologie in 1878 to denote a loss of ability to grasp the meaning of visual stimuli without loss of the ability to see. Munk had observed this condition in a dog with a limited lesion in the occipital cortex. See theory OF MIND. mind-blind adj.
