- (1969- ) Finnish software developer. In 1991, while a student at the University of Helsinki, he began work, as a hobby, on what later became the kernel of the Linux operating system. Although Linux quickly became an open-source project, Torvalds gave his name to the system (unwittingly) and remains the final authority on what alterations are made to its kernel. He currently (2014) works for the Linux Foundation.
