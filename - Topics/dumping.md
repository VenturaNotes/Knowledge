- The selling of goods abroad at prices below their marginal cost, which implies that the seller is making a loss. It has often been argued that developing countries wishing to establish an industry should use tariffs and quotas to ensure a monopoly for producers at home, while selling goods cheaply overseas. However, this practice inevitably leads to claims of dumping by other countries. The World Trade Organization allows countries to prevent dumping by imposing tariffs on goods that are being dumped, although it is always difficult to establish conclusively that a particular price level constitutes dumping. Dumping is prohibited in the EU.

- Selling goods in a foreign country at a price which local producers regard as unfairly low. This may mean selling at less than the long-run average costs of production plus transport costs; charging a lower price in export markets than is charged for comparable goods in home markets; or simply selling at a price with which producers in the importing country cannot compete. Anti-dumping duties are tariffs imposed in response to alleged dumping.
