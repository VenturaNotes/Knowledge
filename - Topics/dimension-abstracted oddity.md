- $n$. A type of oddity problem in which the set of stimuli contains an odd one out, distinguishable from the others on an oddity-defining dimension, and the other alternatives are indistinguishable from one another on the oddity-defining dimension but distinguishable from one another on other dimensions, often called ambiguous dimensions . Such a problem differs from a conventional oddity problem, in which, apart from the odd one out, the stimuli are indistinguishable from one another on any dimension. A typical example might involve a set of objects differing perceptibly in size, color, and shape, including an odd one out that is a different size from the other stimuli, which in turn are indistinguishable in size but differ from one another in color and shape.
