- Conduct in the running of a company's affairs that may entitle members to a remedy under the Companies Act. In small companies, the unfairness may consist of a failure by some members to honour a common understanding reached when the company was formed, e.g. that a member be allowed to assist in the management and be paid accordingly. The usual remedy sought is for the purchase of the member's shares at a fair price. See also MINORITY PROTECTION.
