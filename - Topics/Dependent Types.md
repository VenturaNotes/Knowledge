## Source [^1]
- In computer science and logic, a dependent type is a type whose definition depends on a value
- It is an overlapping feature of [[type theory]] and [[type systems]]
- In [[intuitionistic type theory]], dependent types are used to encode logic's quantifiers like "for all" and "there exists"
- In [[functional programming languages]] such as [[Agda]], [[ATS]], [[Coq]], [[F*]], [[Epigram]], [[Idris]], and [[Lean]], dependent types help reduce bugs by enabling the programmer to assign types that further restrain the set of possible implementations. 
- Common examples of dependent types are [[dependent functions]] and [[dependent pairs]]
