- $n$. the complete removal of an organ, tumor, or cyst leaving surrounding structures intact. In ophthalmology it is an operation in which the eyeball is removed but the other structures in the socket (e.g. eye muscles) are left in place. Commonly a plastic ball is buried in the socket to give a better cosmetic result when fitting an artificial eye.
