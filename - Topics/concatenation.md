- The operation of joining two strings to form a longer string. The concatenation of the strings

  

$$

u=a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m} \text { and } v=b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n}

$$

  

is the following string of length $m+n$ :

  

$$

a_{1}, \ldots, a_{m} b_{1}, \ldots, b_{n}

$$

  

Common notations for referring to it include $u v$ and $u<>v$, but others are also used.

  

The term concatenation is also generalized to an operation on sets of strings (i.e. formal languages). Let $K$ and $L$ be two sets of strings. Then they can be combined into the following set by concatenating strings from $K$ with strings from $L$ in all possible ways:

  

$$

\{u v \mid u \in K, v \in L\}

$$

  

This set is usually written $K L$. The phrase language concatenation is sometimes used to distinguish this from simple concatenation of strings. Both string concatenation and language concatenation give rise to monoids, the identity elements being $\Lambda$ and $\{\Lambda\}$ respectively (where $\Lambda$ is the empty string).
