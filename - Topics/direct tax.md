- A tax paid directly by the party on whom the formal incidence falls. Examples are income taxes, capital taxes, and property taxes. In contrast an indirect tax (for example, value-added tax) is paid by an intermediary. The distinction is of limited value for analysing the economic incidence of the tax but can have salience if bounded rationality or behavioural economics explain the actions of taxpayers.
