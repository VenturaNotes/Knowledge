- Stickiness is a quality websites have that results in people staying on the site for long periods of time. Website designers and managers want a website that has high levels of stickiness. To achieve stickiness, a website must have good graphics, a pleasing and easy-to-read layout, and interesting content.
## Source[^2]
- A tendency for certain economic variables, notably prices and wages, to 'stick' at or near their existing levels despite changes in supply and demand. For example, companies tend not to cut the wages of existing employees, even where market forces might seem to demand this; wages (like prices) are therefore said to be 'sticky downward'. Various factors have been cited to explain such stickiness: these include the limited information available to transactors, the role of long-term fixed-price or fixed-wage contracts, the hidden costs of repricing (see MENU COSTS), and consumer resistance to sudden or frequent change.
