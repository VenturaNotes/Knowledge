- $n$. a condition in which the alkalinity of body fluids and tissues is abnormally high. This arises because of a failure of the mechanisms that usually maintain a balance between alkalis and acids in the arterial blood (see ACID-BASE BALANCE). Alkalosis may be associated with loss of acid through vomiting or with excessive sodium bicarbonate intake. Breathing that is abnormally deep in relation to the amount of physical exercise may lead to respiratory alkalosis. Alkalosis may produce symptoms of muscular weakness or cramp.

- A condition in which the body fluids become more alkaline, i.e. the pH is more than 7.4.
