## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A complex of enzymes within a cell that form a reaction sequence of a biochemical pathway so that the product of the first enzyme reaction is transferred directly to the next enzyme and immediately undergoes a second reaction, and so on. The rate of an enzyme reaction often depends on the concentration of the enzyme and the substrate, both being required in relatively high amounts. Multienzyme systems, such as those involved in RNA and protein synthesis, help maintain a high rate of cellular metabolism since the intermediate products are transferred directly to the next enzyme and are therefore not required in large concentrations.
