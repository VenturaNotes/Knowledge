- Devices used by countries to encourage exports. These can include tax incentives for exporters, allowing them exemptions from the usual provisions of anti-monopoly legislation, preferential access to capital markets, priority allocations of materials in countries where these are controlled, allowing exporters to retain export earnings rather than having to exchange them at the official exchange rate in countries with over-valued currencies, and official honours for successful exporters.
