- (free enterprise) An economic system in which citizens are allowed to own capital and property and to run their own businesses with a minimum of state interference. The free-enterprise system encourages entrepreneurs and the making of profits by private individuals and firms. See FREE MARKET.
## Source[^2]
- The system by which economic activity is undertaken by independent individuals or firms, rather than under central direction. The concept of private enterprise has political connotations beyond the purely economic meaning. In the political sphere, support for private enterprise follows from the claim that it is generally beneficial not so much because it is private, as because it is enterprising, which makes for greater efficiency and more technical improvements than centrally controlled firms would produce.
