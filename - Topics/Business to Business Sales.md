- Business-to-business (B2B) sales happen when a business sells its products and services to another business. B2B sales are different from business-to-consumer (B2C) sales, where a business sells products and services to consumers. B2B sales typically generate more revenue than B2C sales and require longer sales cycles. They might also need approval from various managers or multiple stakeholders.
