- A device that is subsidiary or peripheral to a computer system, usually a terminal or other remote device. In some I/O instructions the designation of an external device is made by specifying a (usually binary) number that distinguishes that device from all others. This number is often called the external device address although, strictly speaking, it is not an address in the true sense. See also ADDRESS SPACE.
