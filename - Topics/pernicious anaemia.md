- a form of anaemia resulting from deficiency of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$. This is due either to the failure of the body to produce the substance (intrinsic factor) that facilitates absorption of $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ from the bowel or to dietary deficiency of the vitamin. Pernicious anaemia is characterized by defective production of red blood cells and the presence of megaloblasts in the bone marrow. In severe forms the nervous system is affected (see SUBACUTE COMBINED DEGENERATION OF THE CORD). The condition is treated by injections of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.
