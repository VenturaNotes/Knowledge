- (roughage) nonstarch polysaccharides (NSP), which cannot be digested and absorbed to produce energy; specifically, sources of NSP that do not contain lignin or resistant starch. Fibre is divided into two types: insoluble (cellulose and hemicelluloses) and soluble (pectins). Highly refined foods, such as sucrose, do not contain dietary fibre. Foods with a high fibre content include wholemeal cereals, vegetables, nuts, and fruit. A diet high in insoluble fibre (e.g. wheat bran, wholegrain and wholemeal bread and cereals) may help prevent bowel diseases, such as constipation, diverticulitis, and colon cancer. Soluble fibre (e.g. oats, barley, beans, pulses, fruit, and vegetables) slows the reabsorption of bile salts and so helps to lower cholesterol as well as dampening the glycaemic response to glucose (see GLYCAEMIC INDEX). A high-fibre diet used to be the first-line advice for irritable bowel syndrome; however, a low FODMAP diet can be more effective.
