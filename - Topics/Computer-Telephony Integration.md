- Computer-Telephony Integration (CTI) refers to the method that links computers with telephone systems. It enables voice and data to synchronize appropriately with the desktop. This integration is necessary to enable a variety of services, including voice, video, audio, and more. As such, it is considered a critical component of modern-day communication. Newer upgrades in CTI can also enable enhanced integration with other business-friendly programs. This includes customer-relationship managers (CRM).
