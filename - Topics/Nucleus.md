- $n$. 
- (1) the part of a cell that contains the genetic material, DNA. The DNA, which is combined with protein, is normally dispersed throughout the nucleus as chromatin. During cell division the chromatin becomes visible as chromosomes. The nucleus also contains RNA, most of which is located in the nucleolus. The nucleus is separated from the cytoplasm by a double membrane, the nuclear envelope. 
- (2) an anatomically and functionally distinct mass of nerve cells within the brain or spinal cord. 
- (3) the central part of the lens of the eye, which is harder than the outer cortex.

- (pl. nuclei) 
- (1) (in cytology) The large body embedded in the cytoplasm of all eukaryote cells that contains the genetic material DNA organized into chromosomes. The nucleus functions as the control center of the cell and is bounded by a double membrane (the nuclear envelope). When the cell is not dividing, one or more nucleoli are present in the nucleus and the chromosomal material (chromatin) is dispersed in the nucleoplasm. In dividing cells the chromosomes become much shorter and thicker and the nucleolus disappears. The contents of the nucleus constitute the nucleoplasm. In certain protists there are two nuclei per cell, a macronucleus (or meganucleus) concerned with vegetative functions and a micronucleus involved in sexual reproduction. 
- (2) (in neuroanatomy) A cluster of nerve cell bodies in the central nervous system or in a nerve ganglion, usually having a shared function or anatomical features. 
- (3) (in physics) The core of an atom that contains most of its mass.

- $n$. 
- (1) The spherical or egg-shaped compartment in the protoplasm of a cell, enclosed in a membrane, containing the chromosomes and other important structures that determine the behavior of the cell. See also eUKaryote, proKaryote. 
- (2) More generally, the central or core part or element of any structure, especially an anatomically or functionally distinct area of grey matter containing a collection of neuron cell bodies.
