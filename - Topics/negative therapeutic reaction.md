- $n$. A temporary worsening of symptoms as a result of treatment. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) described this phenomenon in his book The Ego and the Id (1923): â€˜Every partial solution that ought to result, and in other people does result, in an improvement or a temporary suspension of symptoms produces in them for the time being an exacerbation of their illness; they get worse during the treatment instead of getting better' (Standard Edition, XIX, pp. 12-66, at p. 49). Freud attributed it to resistance and to the patient's preference for suffering over being cured.
