## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
### Loop Invariant
- Loop terminates (along with reason) which gives us a useful property that helps show the algorithm is correct

## Source[^2]
- (1) The end of execution of a process. A process that reaches a successful conclusion terminates normally by issuing a suitable supervisor call to the operating system. See also ABNORMAL TERMINATION. 
- (2) (of an Ethernet) The device attached to the end of an Ethernet segment that suppresses any reflection from the end of the cable. The terminator is a simple resistor, whose resistance is equal to the characteristic impedance of the cable to which it is attached, standardized as being 50 ohms. The termination totally absorbs any incoming signal, and eliminates reflections back into the segment. See also BUS TERMINATOR.
