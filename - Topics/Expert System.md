- An expert system is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make decisions for a person or organization. The expert system "learns" from experience and provides recommendations or solutions to problems. Expert systems tend to operate through an if-then decision tree, where each decision point branches off to other potential decisions. If the system encounters a new situation, it will "learn" and add that scenario to its decision tree.

- A computer application used to solve problems in a particular area of knowledge. The system uses the computer's ability to store, organize, and retrieve large amounts of information and is programmed to make decisions of the type that would be made by an expert in the field. Typically, an expert-system program asks questions of the user, who chooses one of several possible answers. This leads to other questions, and eventually to a conclusion. A common successful use is in basic medical diagnosis, but expert systems can also be designed for analysis of company results, review of loan applications, buying stocks and shares, and other financial purposes.
