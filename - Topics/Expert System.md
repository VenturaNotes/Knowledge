- An expert system is a computer program that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to make decisions for a person or organization. The expert system "learns" from experience and provides recommendations or solutions to problems. Expert systems tend to operate through an if-then decision tree, where each decision point branches off to other potential decisions. If the system encounters a new situation, it will "learn" and add that scenario to its decision tree.
