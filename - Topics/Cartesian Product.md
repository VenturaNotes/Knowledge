- In programming or [[type theory]], a Cartesian product type is a type that represents all possible pairs of values, where each pair consists of
	- A value of type A
	- A value of type B
- Which is written as $A \times B$ 

## Source[^2]
- Can apply the [[multiplicative principle]] to a problem by finding the [[cartesian product]] of two sets given the [[ordered pair|ordered pairs]] $(a,b)$ where  $a \in A \land b \in B$.
	- So the number of choices we have if we can have one of 8 appetizers and one of 14 entrees would be $|A \times B|$ where $a$ $\in$ A represents appetizers in A and $b \in B$ represents entrees in B. This would give $|A|$ $\cdot$ $|B|$ = $8*14$ = $112$ 
		- #question Why is the $\times$ symbol not used to show multiplication in the second part?
## Source[^3]
- The set of all ordered pairs formed by multiplying the elements of two sets.
