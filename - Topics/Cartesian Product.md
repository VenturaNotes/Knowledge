- In programming or [[type theory]], a Cartesian product type is a type that represents all possible pairs of values, where each pair consists of
	- A value of type A
	- A value of type B
- Which is written as $A \times B$ 

## Source[^2]
- Can apply the [[multiplicative principle]] to a problem by finding the [[cartesian product]] of two sets given the [[ordered pair|ordered pairs]] $(a,b)$ where  $a \in A \land b \in B$.
	- So the number of choices we have if we can have one of 8 appetizers and one of 14 entrees would be $|A \times B|$ where $a$ $\in$ A represents appetizers in A and $b \in B$ represents entrees in B. This would give $|A|$ $\cdot$ $|B|$ = $8*14$ = $112$

- The set of all ordered pairs formed by multiplying the elements of two sets.

- of two sets $S$ and $T$. The set of all ordered pairs of the form $(s, t)$ with the property that $s$ is a member of $S$ and $t$ is a member of $T$; this is usually written as $S \times T$. Formally,

  

$$

S \times T=\{(s, t) \mid(s \in S) \text { and }(t \in T)\}

$$

  

If $R$ denotes the set of real numbers, then $R \times R$ is just the set of points in the (Cartesian) plane or it can be regarded as the set of complex numbers, hence the name.

  

The concept can be extended to deal with the Cartesian product of $n$ sets,

  

$$

S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots, S_{n}

$$

  

This is the set of ordered $n$-tuples

  

$$

\left(s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots, s_{n}\right)

$$

  

with the property that each $s_{i}$ is in $S_{i}$. In the case where each $S_{i}$ is the same set $S$, it is customary to write $S^{n}$ for

  

$$

S \times S \times \ldots S(n \text { terms })

$$
