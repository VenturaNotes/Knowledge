- A point at which a function of several variables is at a maximum for movement in some directions and a minimum for movement in the remaining directions. Assume $f(x)$ is to be maximized subject to $g(x)$ $\geq 0$, where $x=\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$. Then the maximum occurs at a saddle point of the Lagrangian function $L \equiv f(x)+\lambda g(x)$, with $L$ maximized for each $x_{i}$ and minimized for $\lambda$.
