- a legal document, signed by a doctor, stating (in Part 1) the immediate cause of a person's death followed by diseases underlying the condition. For example, if the immediate cause of death was a myocardial infarction, the underlying disease might have been ischaemic heart disease or hypertension. Other diseases, which were not directly linked with the immediate cause of death but may have contributed to the patient's overall condition, are mentioned in Part 2 of the certificate. The document usually states the decedent's gender and date and place of death; other details, such as occupation, may also be included. The death certificate forms a vital record in most countries throughout the world; without a death certificate, there can be no funeral. For England and Wales, this information is held at the General Register Office, which is now in Southport. In Scotland death certificates are kept at the National Records of Scotland, and in Northern Ireland at the General Register Office for Northern Ireland. Following the case of the serial killer Dr Harold Shipman and the subsequent public enquiry, legislation has introduced greater checks on, and scrutiny of, death certification by doctors.
