- Bring your own bandwidth (BYOB) is a telecommunications setup in which a business buys voice services from a voice-over-internet provider (VoIP) and uses a different internet service provider to host those services. This setup allows corporations to avoid expensive broadband voice and internet service bundles that feature unnecessary add-ons. BYOB is often used by companies with remote employees because it allows employees to use their own broadband internet connection to facilitate business calls.
