- Alteration of the shape of a pulse. Pulse-shaping circuits may receive pulses that are distorted and convert them into rectangular pulses, sometimes incorporating a monostable circuit to set the output pulse width, although this is not regarded as good practice. Another application of pulse shaping is in controlling the edge speed of pulses or limiting overshoots
