- Software designed to facilitate and integrate key tasks in the management of a large project. These typically include scheduling, network modelling, budget control, and administrative support; the system may also include a collaborative decision support system. A good system will be integrated and dynamic, so that the total knock-on effect of any departures from the original plan can be assessed in key areas (e.g. budgeting, scheduling) as the project evolves.
