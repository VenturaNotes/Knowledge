- A modified leaf with a flower or inflorescence in its axil. Bracts are often brightly colored and may be mistaken for the petals of a flower. For example the showy 'flowers' of poinsettia and Bougainvillea are composed of bracts; the true flowers are comparatively inconspicuous. See also INVOLUCRE.
