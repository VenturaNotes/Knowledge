- $n$. The simple repetition (without elaboration) of items that need to be remembered in order to prevent them fading from short-term memory, as when a person repeats a telephone number over and over while searching for a pen and paper to write it down. It develops spontaneously in children at 6-7 years of age. See also Phonological loop, REHEARSE (2). Compare ELABORATIVE REHEARSAL.
