### (angular)
- (angular) A configuration of two half-lines, or arms, emanating from a point; the angle is said to be subtended by its arms. The angle is measured as a fraction of a full angle equating to $360$ degrees or $2 \pi$ radians; centering a unit circle at the point, the angle's measure in radians is equal to the length of the arc between the two arms. Angles may also have a positive (anticlockwise) sense or a negative (clockwise) sense. See also ACUTE ANGLE, ADJACENT ANGLES, COMPLEMENTARY ANGLES, CONJUGATE ANGLES, EXTERIOR ANGLE, INTERIOR ANGLE, OBTUSE ANGLE, REFLEX ANGLE, RIGHT ANGLE, STRAIGHT ANGLE, SUPPLEMENTARY ANGLES. Compare SOLID ANGLE.
### (between lines in space)
- Given two lines in space, let $u_1$ and $u_2$ be vectors with directions along the lines. Then the angle between the lines, even if they do not meet, is equal to the angle between the vectors $u_1$ and $u_2$ (see ANGLE (between vectors)), with the directions of $u_1$ and $u_2$ chosen so that the angle $\theta$ satisfies $0 \le \theta \le \frac \pi 2$ ($\theta$ in radians), or $0 \le \theta \le 90 (\theta \text{ in degrees).}$ If $l_1, m_1, n_1 \text{ and } l_2, m_2, n_2$ are direction ratios for directions along the lines, the angle $\theta$ between the lines is given by $$cos\theta = \frac{|l_1l_2+m_1m_2+n_1n_2|}{\sqrt{l_1^2+m_1^2+n_1^2}\sqrt{l_2^2+m_2^2+n_2^2}}.$$
### (between lines in the plane)
- In coordinate geometry of the plane, the angle $\alpha$ between two lines with gradients $m_1$ and $m_2$ is given by $$tan \theta = \frac{m_1 - m_2}{1 + m_1m_2}$$This is obtained from the $tan(A-B)$ formula. In the special cases where $m_1m_2 = -1$ or when $m_1$ or $m_2$ is infinite, it has to be interpreted as follows: if $m_1m_2 = -1, \theta = 90\degree$; if $m_i$ is infinite, $\theta = 90\degree -|tan^{-1}m_j|$ where $j \ne i$; and if $m_1$ and $m_2$ are both infinite, $\theta = 0$. 

### (between planes)
- Given two planes, let $n_1$ and $n_2$ be vectors normal to the two planes. Then a method of obtaining the angle between the planes is to take the angle between $n_1$ and $n_2$ (see ANGLE (between vectors)), with the directions of $n_1$ and $n_2$ chosen so that the angle $\theta$ satisfies $0 \le \theta \le \frac \pi 2$ ($\theta$ in radians), or $0 \le \theta \le 90$ ($\theta$ in degrees). 

### (between vectors)
- Given non-zero vectors $a$ and $b$, let $\overrightarrow {OA}$ and $\overrightarrow {OB}$ be directed line segments representing $a$ and $b$. Then the angle $\theta$ between the vectors $a$ and $b$ is the angle $\angle AOB$, where $\theta$ is taken to satisfy $0 \le \theta \le \pi$ ($\theta$ in radians), or $0 \le \theta \le 180$ ($\theta$ in degrees). It can be expressed in terms of the scalar product by $$cos \theta= \frac{a\cdot b}{|a||b|}$$

- $n$. 
- (1) (in anatomy) a corner. For example, the angle of the eye is the outer or inner corner of the eye; the angle of the mouth is the site where the upper and lower lips join on either side. 
- (2) the degree of divergence of two lines or planes that meet each other; the space between two such lines. The carrying angle is the obtuse angle formed between the forearm and the upper arm when the forearm is fully extended and the hand is supinated.
