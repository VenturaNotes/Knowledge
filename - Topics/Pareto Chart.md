- A type of bar chart in which vertical bars representing the relative frequency (or cost) of a set of factors are displayed in descending order of size (i.e. with the most significant factor or cause on the left and the least so on the right). A line graph is generally superimposed to show the cumulative total of the frequencies; this will rise to $100 \%$ at the right vertical axis. The purpose is to enable an analysis of the most common causes of a problem (e.g. defects in a product) in terms of Pareto's Rule. For example, a Pareto chart might show that some $80 \%$ of defects could be eradicated by tackling only two or three causes. The chart is one of the seven tools of quality.
