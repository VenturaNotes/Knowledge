- $n$. an abnormal change in the nature of a tissue, usually in response to an environmental factor. For instance, columnar epithelium lining the bronchi may be converted to squamous epithelium (squamous metaplasia) following exposure to cigarette smoke. Prolonged exposure to gastric acid may result in the squamous epithelium of the oesophagus being converted to glandular epithelium (glandular metaplasia). Myeloid metaplasia is the development of bone marrow elements, normally found only within the marrow cavities of the bones, in organs such as the spleen and liver. This may occur after bone marrow failure. Metaplasia is not itself a premalignant condition, but neoplasms (abnormal new growths) may arise in metaplastic tissues if the initiating stimulus is not removed. $\textemdash$metaplastic adj.
