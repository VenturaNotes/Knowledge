- The formerly widely used long ton of 2240 pounds has now been replaced by the metric ton or tonne of 1,000 kilograms for all purposes of trade and commerce. In the USA the short ton of 2000 lb is still in use (consisting of 20 short hundredweights of 100 lb each). The shipping ton is a measure of cargo-carrying capacity and consists of 100 cubic feet of space (see TONNAGE).
