- (EECP) an experimental treatment for patients with intractable angina. Specially designed inflatable trousers are inflated rhythmically in time with ventricular diastole. Theoretically this imparts additional energy to the circulating blood volume when the heart is relaxed, and this may improve blood flow down severely narrowed coronary arteries. It is also claimed to have beneficial effects on blood flow to other organs. Despite promising clinical trials, this technique has not been widely adopted.
