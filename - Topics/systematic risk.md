## Synthesis

- (residual risk) The element of risk in a portfolio of investments that cannot be reduced by diversification, because it is common to all securities of the same general class. The compensation that an investor requires for undertaking such risks forms the basis for the risk premium calculation of the capital asset pricing model and arbitrage pricing theory. A particular asset's exposure to systematic risk is measured by the beta coefficient. Compare SPECIFIC RISK.

- Risk arising from disturbances which affect all projects in a class. This type of risk cannot be reduced by diversification. This is contrasted with non-systematic or idiosyncratic risk, where the disturbances affecting different projects are independent, so that the overall risk of a portfolio of assets can be reduced by dividing it among a number of projects. In the stock market, for example, risk is partly systematic: there are market-level factors that affect most share prices in the same direction. It is also partly idiosyncratic: every industry and every company is affected by different random disturbances. This should be distinguished from the systemic risk.
