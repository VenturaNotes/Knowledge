- $n$. a genus of widely distributed non-bloodsucking flies, the flesh flies. Maggots are normally found in carrion or excrement but occasionally females will deposit their eggs in wounds or ulcers giving off a foul-smelling discharge; the presence of the maggots causes a serious myiasis. Rarely, maggots may be ingested with food and give rise to an intestinal myiasis.
