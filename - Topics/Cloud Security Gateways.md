- A cloud security gateway is a network appliance that protects an organization's data when stored in or accessed through the public internet. The term "cloud" refers to how these gateways are installed on public networks instead of within private ones. This makes them more accessible for users to access remotely without having to install anything locally on their devices. Cloud security gateways provide protection against attacks such as DDoS (distributed denial-of-service) by blocking traffic from malicious sources before it can reach servers and databases. They also protect against malware infections by scanning files downloaded over email attachments and filtering spam messages sent directly through email.
