## Synthesis
- Unique cells or [[nerve ending|nerve endings]] designed to detect specific [[stimulus|stimuli]] (light, sound, chemicals, touch, temperature, pain) and convert them into electrical signals (nerve impulses) for the nervous system, enabling perception and bodily awareness; key types include photoreceptors (light), mechanoreceptors (movement/touch), chemoreceptors (chemicals/taste/smell), thermoreceptors (heat), and nociceptors (pain).
