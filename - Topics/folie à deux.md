- (shared delusion) a condition in which two people who are closely involved with each other share one or more delusions. Usually, one member of the pair, called the inducer, has developed a psychosis and has imposed it on the other by a process of suggestion. More rarely, both members are delusional and elaborate their delusions or hallucinations together. More than two people may be involved (folie à trois, folie à quatre, etc.). Treatment usually involves separation of the affected people and management according to their individual requirements. The inducer usually requires antipsychotic medication. See also DELUSION BY PROXY; DOUBLE DELUSION.
