- (find and change) In word processing, to search for a text string and then replace it with another one. The process may be stopped after a single replacement, it may replace all occurrences of the search string without asking, or it may ask for confirmation at each potential replacement. When replacing all occurrences of the search string in an entire document, a global search and replace, it is good practice to ask for confirmation.
