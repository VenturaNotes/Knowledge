- (dysphasia) $n$. a disorder of language affecting the generation and content of speech and its understanding (it is not a disorder of articulation: see DYSARTHRIA). It is caused by damage to the language-dominant half of the brain, which is usually the left hemisphere in a right-handed person. In expressive aphasia there is difficulty in producing language; in receptive aphasia there is difficulty with the comprehension of the spoken word. Aphasia is commonly accompanied by difficulties in reading and writing. â€”aphasic adj.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. An impairment of expression or comprehension of language caused by injury or disease in the language centers of the brain. The major forms related specifically to speech (see also AGRAPHIA, DYSLEXIA) are: acoustic-mnestic aphasia (impaired ability to recall lists of words or to repeat long sentences, caused by a lesion in the left temporal lobe of the brain); agrammatism (impairment in ability to arrange words in their correct order, to use function words properly, and/or to use accidence appropriately in an inflecting language); amnesic aphasia (impaired ability to retrieve words that are required for fluent speech, also written amnestic aphasia); anomic aphasia (impaired ability to name objects or representations of objects, also called anomia; compare amnesic aphasia); aphemia (another name for Broca's aphasia); ataxic aphasia (another name for Broca's aphasia); auditory aphasia (another name for Wernicke's aphasia); Broca's aphasia (impaired ability to speak, with intact ability to comprehend speech, associated with damage to Broca's area of the brain); conduction aphasia (impaired ability to repeat spoken words, together with errors in word selection in spontaneous speech, resulting from damage to the links between auditory and motor areas of the brain; compare TRANSCORTICAL APHASIA, TRANSCORTICAL MOTOR APHASIA, TRANSCORTICAL SENSORY APHASIA; see also ARCUATE FASCICULUS); dynamic aphasia (a variant of non-fluent aphasia characterized by almost total failure to initiate speech but an intact ability to name objects, to read, and to repeat sentences); dysprosody (impaired ability to produce the appropriate prosody required in speech); expressive aphasia (another name for Broca's aphasia); fluent aphasia (any form of aphasia, such as Wernicke's aphasia or conduction aphasia, in which speech flows without difficulty, but either language comprehension is impaired or the speech is unintelligible); ideomotor aphasia (a generic term for transcortical motor aphasia, transcortical sensory aphasia, and mixed transcortical aphasia); jargon aphasia (copious unintelligible speech); laloplegia (a form of aphasia resulting from paralysis of the muscles of the vocal tract and not those of the tongue); mixed transcortical aphasia (a blend of transcortical motor aphasia and transcortical sensory aphasia, with impaired spontaneous speech but intact ability to repeat spoken language; compare CONDUCTION APhASIA); motor aphasia (another name for Broca's aphasia); nominal aphasia (a form of amnesic aphasia in which there is an impaired ability to retrieve the names of people or things); non-fluent aphasia (any form of aphasia, such as Broca's aphasia, in which speech is impaired); optic aphasia (selective impairment in ability to name objects presented visually, with intact ability to name them after touching them); paraphasia (habitual substitution of one word for another); receptive aphasia (another name for Wernicke's aphasia); sensory aphasia (another name for Wernicke's aphasia); spasmophemia (speech that is impaired by spasms of the muscles in the vocal tract); standard aphasia (sparse speech with content words but few function words); syntactic aphasia (impaired ability to arrange words in grammatical sequence); tactile aphasia (selective impairment in ability to name objects by touch alone, with intact ability to name them after seeing them); transcortical motor aphasia (any form of aphasia resulting from disconnection of fibre tracts across the cortex to motor areas, resulting in impaired spontaneous speech but intact ability to repeat spoken language; compare CONDUCTION APhASIA); transcortical sensory aphasia (any form of aphasia resulting from disconnection of fibre tracts across the cortex to sensory areas, resulting in impaired spontaneous speech but intact ability to repeat spoken language; compare CONDUCTION APhASIA); visual aphasia (another name for alexia); Wernicke's aphasia (impaired ability to understand speech, with intact ability to speak fluently, though not always intelligibly, associated with damage to Wernicke's area in the brain). Compare DYSPHONIA, MUTISM, SELECTIVE MUTISM. \[From Greek $a$- without + phasis speech, from phanai to speak + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
