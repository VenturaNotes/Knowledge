- (dysphasia) $n$. a disorder of language affecting the generation and content of speech and its understanding (it is not a disorder of articulation: see DYSARTHRIA). It is caused by damage to the language-dominant half of the brain, which is usually the left hemisphere in a right-handed person. In expressive aphasia there is difficulty in producing language; in receptive aphasia there is difficulty with the comprehension of the spoken word. Aphasia is commonly accompanied by difficulties in reading and writing. â€”aphasic adj.
