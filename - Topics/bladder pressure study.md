- a combined X-ray and manometry examination of the bladder to look for abnormal function. The bladder is filled slowly with contrast medium using a small urinary catheter and the pressure is monitored during filling and voiding (micturition). X-ray images of the bladder and urethra (see URETHROGRAPHY) are taken. The test is used to differentiate between obstruction to bladder outflow and abnormal involuntary contractions of the muscle in the bladder wall.
