- (deferred asset; deferred expense) An item of expenditure incurred in an accounting period but, under the accruals concept, not matched with the income it will generate. Instead of being treated as an operating cost for that period, it is treated as an asset with the intention of treating it as an operating cost to be charged against the income it will generate in a future period. An example is rent paid for a period beyond the end of the accounting period.
