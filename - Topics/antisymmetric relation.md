- A binary relation $\sim$ on a set S is antisymmetric if, for all $a$ and $b$ in S, whenever $a \sim b$ and $b \sim a$, then $a = b$. For example, the relation $\le$ on the set of integers is antisymmetric, as is any partial order. Compare ASYMMETRIC RELATION

## Source[^2]
- A relation $R$ defined on a set $S$ and having the property that$$\begin{align}&\text{whenever }xRy \text{ and } yRx \\ &\text{then }x=y\end{align}$$where $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary members of $S$. Examples include 'is a subset of' defined on sets, and 'less than or equal to' defined on the integers. See also ASYMMETRIC RELATION, SYMMETRIC RELATION.
