- A discrete uniform distribution is described by the probability function $P\left[X=x_{i}\right]=1 / N$, where the random variable $X$ can take values $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{N}$. A continuous uniform distribution is described by the probability density function $f_{X}(x)=1 /(b-a)$ where random variable $X$ can take values $x \in[a, b]$, and by the moment generating function $M(t)=\frac{\exp (b t)-\exp (a t)}{t(b-a)}$ for $t \neq 0$. The mean of continuous uniform distribution is $(b-a) / 2$ and the variance is $(b-a)^{2} / 12$.
