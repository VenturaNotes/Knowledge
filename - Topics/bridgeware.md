- Any software or hardware that eases the transition from use of one computer system to use of another not entirely compatible one. Bridgeware is normally supplied by a computer manufacturer when a new range of machines does not offer complete upward compatibility from some previous range. Typically the bridgeware will permit programs developed for the previous range to be executed (perhaps after minor modifications) on the new range of machines. Compare MIDDLEWARE.
