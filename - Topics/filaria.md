- $n$. (pl. filariae) any of the long threadlike nematode worms that, as adults, are parasites of human connective and lymphatic tissues capable of causing disease. They include the genera Brugia, Loa, Onchocerca, and Wuchereria. Filariae differ from the intestinal nematodes (see HOOKWORM) in that they undergo part of their development in the body of a bloodsucking insect, e.g. a mosquito, on which they subsequently depend for their transmission to another human host. See also $\textemdash$ MICROFILARIA. filarial adj.
