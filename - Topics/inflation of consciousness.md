- $n$. In analytical psychology, the expansion of a person's consciousness beyond its normal limits, arising through identification (2) with an archetype (2), the persona (1) or, in certain mental disorders, a famous person, resulting in an exaggerated sense of importance that is generally compensated for by feelings of inferiority. Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) described how it arises when the archetypal content 'seizes hold of the psyche with a kind of primeval force and compels it to transgress the bounds of humanity. The consequence is a puffed-up attitude, loss of free will, delusion and enthusiasm for good and evil alike' (Collected Works, 12, paragraph 563).
