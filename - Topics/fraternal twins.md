- (dizygotic twins) Two individuals that result from a single pregnancy, each having developed from a separate fertilized egg. The two egg cells contain different combinations of alleles and so do the two sperm that fertilize them. The twins therefore have no more genetic similarity than brothers or sisters from single births. Compare IDENTICAL TWINS.
