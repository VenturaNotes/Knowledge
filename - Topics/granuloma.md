- n. (pl. granulomata or granulomas) a localized collection of cells, usually produced in response to an infectious process, that is characterized by the presence of aggregates of epithelioid histiocytes; giant cells, monocytes, or lymphocytes may also be present. The types of cells comprising a granuloma (of which there may be many or few) and their arrangement can assist in diagnosing the cause of the response; this is important in the diagnosis of tuberculosis, sarcoidosis, Crohn's disease, and the presence of certain foreign bodies (e.g. starch, talc). Other conditions giving rise to granulomata include syphilis, leprosy, and coccidioidomycosis, and a granuloma may also occur around the apex of a tooth root as a result of inflammation or infection of its pulp. $\textemdash$ granulomatous adj.
