- A set of variables $z_{t}$ is said to be caused by $x_{t}$ in Granger's sense, if the information on past and present $x_{t}$ helps to improve the forecast of $z_{t}$. Causality in Granger's sense, or Granger causality, does not imply true causality: the former refers to the concept of predictability, and can be tested using statistical tools; the latter refers to the concept of cause and effect, and is often postulated or implied by economic theory.
