- (lambliasis) $n$. a disease caused by the parasitic protozoan Giardia lamblia in the small intestine. Individuals become infected by eating food contaminated with cysts containing the parasite. Symptoms include diarrhoea, nausea, bellyache, and flatulence, as well as the passage of pale fatty stools (steatorrhoea). Large numbers of the parasite may interfere with the absorption of food through the gut wall. The disease occurs throughout the world and is particularly common in children; it responds well to oral doses of metronidazole.
