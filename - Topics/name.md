- A notation for indicating an entity in a program or system. (The word can also be used as a verb.) The kinds of entity that can be named depend on the context, and include variables, data objects, functions, types, and procedures (in programming languages), nodes, stations, and processes (in a data communication network), files, directories, devices (in operating systems), etc. The name denotes the entity, independently of its physical location or address. Names are used for long-term stability (e.g. when specifying a node in a computer program) or for their ease of use by humans (who recognize the name more readily than an address). Names are converted to addresses by a process of [[name lookup]].
- In many languages and systems, a name must be a simple identifier, usually a textual string. In more advanced languages, a name may be composed from several elementary components according to the rules of the language.

- (at Lloyd's) A member of one or more syndicates at Lloyd's providing insurance. A name contributes limited cash when joining a syndicate, and accepts unlimited liability for its obligations. Members share in the profits or losses of syndicates in proportion to the cash they have put in, but are liable for all losses if other members cannot pay. Traditionally, it was assumed that people would only become Lloyd's names if they could afford to lose large amounts. In the 1980s and 1990s large losses by some syndicates led to calls for cash from names. Those calls have led to widespread hardship among names who paid, and extensive litigation involving names who refused to pay.
