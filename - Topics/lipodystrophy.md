- $n$. any condition resulting in the loss and/or redistribution of fat tissue in part or all of the body. It may be congenital or acquired (for example, as an adverse effect of antiretroviral drug treatment). Congenital lipodystrophies include Kobberling-Dunnigan syndrome, an autosomal dominant condition more common in women, who lose fat tissue from their limbs and lower bodies and often also suffer with polycystic ovary syndrome; and Seip-Beradinelli syndrome, which is autosomal recessive and involves more generalized fat-tissue loss. Acquired forms usually follow an acute illness in childhood and may involve all or part of the body.
