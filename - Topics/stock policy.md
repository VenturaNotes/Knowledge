- An insurance policy covering the goods stocked and sold by a commercial company for specified risks or for all risks (see ALL-RISKS POLICY). Policies of this kind are usually based on the price paid for the stock, not the price at which it might be sold, i.e. the insurance does not cover loss of profit or mark-up on the stock.
