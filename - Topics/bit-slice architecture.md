## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A computer architecture or design, used especially for microprocessors, in which the CPU is constructed by concatenating a number of high-performance processing units. Each of these 'slice' elements represents a limited width (commonly 2, 4, or 8 bits) of an ALU and CU section; a parallel computer of any desired word size can therefore be constructed. Specific system customization is accomplished by microprogramming. This form of architecture permits the use of standard (thus low-cost) VLSI elements to produce different computer systems.
