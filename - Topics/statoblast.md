- A chitinous bud that is produced asexually by moss animals and other members of the Bryozoa. It stores food and is able to remain dormant for long periods, withstanding drought and extreme temperatures. Statoblasts may be liberated and dispersed after the death of the parent zooid, and subsequently 'germinate' to produce a zooid capable of founding a new colony.
