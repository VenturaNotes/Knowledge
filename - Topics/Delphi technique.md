- A qualitative forecasting technique that seeks to eliminate the effects of personal relationships and domination by strong personalities. A coordinator sends a written question to each relevant expert, who then replies in writing. The replies are edited and summarized. On the basis of the summary, new questions are issued to the experts, who again reply in writing. The cycle is repeated until the coordinator is satisfied that the process has provided an objective assessment of the issue in question (e.g. the likely sales of a new product).
