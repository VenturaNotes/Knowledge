## Synthesis
- Refers to maximum size of a packet or frame that can be transmitted over a network without fragmentation
	- A frame is a data unit at the [[data link layer]] (layer 2) of the [[OSI model]]
		- Encapsulates the packet (from the [[network layer]]) with additional header and trailer information required for data link communication
	- Fragmentation occurs when a packet exceeds the MTU size and needs to be divided into smaller packets for [[transmission]]
- Determined by network technology and infrastructure such as
	- [[Ethernet]]
		- Around 1500 bytes
	- [[Wi-Fi]]
		- Ranges from 1500 to 2304 bytes
	- [[DSL]]
		- Varies on DSL technology and configurations
- Impacts efficiency and performance of data transmission
	- Large packets may require fragmentation or may be subject to higher error rates in some cases
