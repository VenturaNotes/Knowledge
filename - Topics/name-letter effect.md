- $n$. A tendency to evaluate letters in one's name more favorably than other letters. This has a small but significant influence on people's choices, including where they choose to live and whom they choose to marry. The effect was discovered by the Belgian psychologist Jozef M. Nuttin (1933-2014) and first named in the title of an article he published in the European Journal of Social Psychology in 1985. In a large-scale study of a sample of 582,007 full-time employees in Belgian private companies published in the journal Psychological Science in 2008, researchers compared the initial letters of employees' and employing companies' names and found the frequency of matches to be higher than chance expectation for every letter of the alphabet apart from X. Compare MERE EXPOSURE EFFECT. NLE abbrev.
