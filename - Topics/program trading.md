- Trading on financial markets using computer programs that trigger automatic trades once certain limits are reached. Program trading was introduced in the late 1980s and has been partly blamed for the market crash in October 1987. Although the New York Stock Exchange imposed limits on program trading, it now accounts for some $30 \%$ of trades on NYSE. Advances in technology have seen the development of program trading into the more sophisticated use of computer algorithms in high-frequency trading.
