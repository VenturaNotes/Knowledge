- An important concept in formal language theory that underlies the notion of a grammar. It was defined and investigated by Axel Thue from about 1904. A semi-Thue system over the alphabet $\Sigma$ is a finite set of ordered pairs of $\Sigma$-words:

  

$$

\left\{\left\langle l_{i}, r_{i}\right\rangle, \ldots,\left\langle l_{m}, r_{m}\right\rangle\right\}

$$

  

Each pair $\left\langle l_{i}, r_{i}\right\rangle$ is a rule, referred to as a [[production]], with left-hand side $l_{i}$ and right-hand side $r_{i}$; it is usually written

  

$$

l_{i} \rightarrow r_{i}

$$

  

Let $u$ and $v$ be $\Sigma$-words, and $l \rightarrow r$ be a production, then the word $u l v$ is said to directly derive the word $u r v$; this is written

  

$$

u l v \Rightarrow u r v

$$

  

So $w$ directly derives $w^{\prime}$ if $w^{\prime}$ is the result of applying a production to some substring of $w$. if

  

$$

w_{1} \Rightarrow w_{2} \Rightarrow \ldots \Rightarrow w_{n-1} \Rightarrow w_{n}

$$

  

then $w_{1}$ is said to derive $w_{\mathrm{n}}$; this is written

  

$$

w_{1} \stackrel{\circ}{\Rightarrow} w_{n}

$$

  

So $w$ derives $w^{\prime}$ if $w^{\prime}$ is obtained from $w$ by a sequence of direct derivations.

As one example, let $\Sigma$ be $\{a, b\}$ and let the productions be

  

$$

\{a b \rightarrow b a, b a \rightarrow a b\}

$$

  

then $a a b b a$ derives baaab by the sequence

  

$$

a a b b a \Rightarrow a b a b a \Rightarrow b a a b a \Rightarrow b a a a b

$$

  

It is clear that $w$ derives any permutation of $w$.

As a second example, with productions

  

$$

\{a b \rightarrow b a, b a \rightarrow A\}

$$

  

$w$ derives $\Lambda$ (the empty word) if and only if $w$ has the same number of as as $b$ s.

The question of whether $w$ derives $w^{\prime}$ is algorithmically undecidable.
