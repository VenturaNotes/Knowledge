- Under UK company law, a private company that satisfies at least two of the following criteria for the current and preceding financial year:
	- its net worth does not exceed $£ 3.26$ million;
	- its turnover does not exceed $£ 6.5$ million;
	- the average number of employees does not exceed 50.
- A company that is in its first financial year may still qualify as a small company if it falls within these limits. Alternatively, if the company has qualified in the two preceding financial years, it may qualify.
- Certain small companies may prepare Abridged accounts for their members and for delivery to the Registrar of Companies.
- Many small companies can also claim total exemption from statutory audit.
- However, if a company is a member of a group containing a public company, a banking or insurance company, or an authorized person under the Financial Services Act 1986, it is not eligible for the exemptions for small companies. See also MICRO-ENTITY; SME.
