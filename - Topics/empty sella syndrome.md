- a congenital malformation of the bony structure (the sella turcica) that houses the pituitary gland such that the space is largely filled with cerebrospinal fluid, which squashes the usually spherical gland into a flattened shape against the floor of the sella. It is usually associated with enlargement of the sella, which can be seen on lateral X-ray. Only 10% of cases of this condition have defective pituitary function.
