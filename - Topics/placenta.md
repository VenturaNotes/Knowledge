- $n$. an organ within the uterus by means of which the embryo is attached to the wall of the uterus. Its primary function is to provide the embryo with nourishment, eliminate its wastes, and exchange respiratory gases. This is accomplished by the close proximity of the maternal and fetal blood systems within the placenta. It also functions as a gland, secreting human chorionic gonadotrophin, progesterone, and oestrogens, which regulate the maintenance of pregnancy. See also AFTERBIRTH. â€”placental adj.
