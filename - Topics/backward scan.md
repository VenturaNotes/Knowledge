- In an activity network (edges as activities), the backward scan identifies the latest time for each vertex (node). Starting with the sink, work backwards through the network, for each vertex calculate the sum of edge plus total time on next vertex for all paths leaving that vertex. Put in the largest of these times onto that vertex
