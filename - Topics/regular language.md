Of the language classes commonly studied, the class of regular languages is the smallest and mathematically the simplest. Its importance is shown by the existence of several alternative definitions; for some of them see LINEAR GRAMMAR, MYHILL EQUIVALENCE, NERODE EQUIVALENCE, REGULAR EXPRESSION, REGULAR GRAMMAR, TREE GRAMMAR.
