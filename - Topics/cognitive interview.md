- $n$. A structured form of interviewing developed in 1984 by the US psychologist R(alph) Edward Geiselman (born 1949) and colleagues as an investigative tool in forensic psychology to maximize the amount of reliable information that witnesses can recall. It incorporates several memory-enhancing features, such as reinstating the context of the episode to be recalled (see STATE-DEPENDENT MEMORY) and encouraging the interviewee to think about the events in different sequences and from different perspectives.
