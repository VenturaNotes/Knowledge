- $n$. A term used mainly in French psychoanalysis, not to denote any specific disorder, but to refer to the tendency for individual neuroses of family members to complement and reinforce one another. The concept was introduced in the title of an article published in a French psychoanalytic journal in 1936: 'La n√©vrose familiale'.
