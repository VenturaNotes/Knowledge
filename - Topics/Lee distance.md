- (Lee metric) In the theory of block codes intended for error detection or error correction, a distance measure analogous to the Hamming distance but modelling more accurately a linear $q$-ary channel, such as the phase-modulated carrier used in modems. When $q=2$ or $q=3$, the Lee and Hamming distances are the same.
