- (2) The maximum range of values that can be held in a register.

- (1) (of a cut) The sum of all the maximum flows allowable across all edges intersecting the cut (see network)
- (2) (of an edge) The maximum flow possible along an edge (see network)

- (system capacity) The highest sustainable output from an operating system in units per given time. A system's overall capacity is determined by the capacity of its 'narrowest' part, i.e. the bottleneck. For example, if a car assembly line can produce 120 cars per hour but the paint shop can only handle 100 cars in an hour, the overall capacity of the plant is 100. Identifying capacity in terms of services can be particularly difficult. For example, students per year provides an insufficient measure of the capacity of a university, as it fails to take into account the quality or effectiveness of the teaching. See also BUDGETED CAPACITY; DESIGNED CAPACITY; EFFECTIVE CAPACITY.
