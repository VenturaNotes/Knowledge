- In a sample, a measure of central tendency of a set of data points. Most commonly referred to as the mean is the arithmetic mean, that is, the unweighted average of a set of numbers. Other frequently used quantities are the geometric mean, the arithmetic-geometric mean, the harmonic mean, the generalized or power mean, and the root-mean-square. For a random variable, the mean is the same as the expected value.
## Source[^2]
- (arithmetic mean) $n$. the average of a group of observations calculated by adding their values and dividing by the number in the group. When one or more observations are substantially different from the rest, which can influence the arithmetic mean unduly, it is preferable to use the geometric mean (a similar calculation based on the logarithmic values of the observations) or $\textendash$ more commonly $\textendash$ the median (the middle observation of the series arranged in ascending order). A further method of obtaining an average or summary value for a group is to identify the mode $\textendash$ the observation (or group of observations when these occur as a continuous quantitative variable) that occurs most often in the series.
## Source[^3]
- The average value of a set of $n$ numbers, i.e. the sum of the numbers divided by $n$.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. Short for arithmetic mean: in descriptive statistics, the average value, calculated for a finite set of scores by adding the scores together and then dividing the total by the number of scores. See also geometric mean, harmonic mean, Lake Wobegon effect, trimmed mean. Compare median, mode. M abbrev. mean adj. \[From Old French moien, from Latin medius middle]
