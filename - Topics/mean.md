- In a sample, a measure of central tendency of a set of data points. Most commonly referred to as the mean is the arithmetic mean, that is, the unweighted average of a set of numbers. Other frequently used quantities are the geometric mean, the arithmetic-geometric mean, the harmonic mean, the generalized or power mean, and the root-mean-square. For a random variable, the mean is the same as the expected value.
