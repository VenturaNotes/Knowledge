- (IRA) A US pension plan that allows annual sums to be set aside from earnings free of tax and accumulated in a fund, which pays interest. Basic-rate tax is payable once the saver starts to withdraw from the account, which must be done no later than the participant's 70th birthday. The concession is not available to employees in a company-pension scheme or profit-sharing scheme.
## Source[^2]
- (IRA) A US retirement plan that provides tax advantages on savings for retirement. IRAs were introduced in 1974 to permit saving in tax-privileged form for employees without pension plans. Eligibility for IRAs was expanded by the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 to permit almost all working taxpayers to contribute, and the IRA limits were increased. This led to a major increase in saving in IRAs. The Tax Reform Act of 1986 changed the position by excluding higher-income taxpayers with employer-provided pensions.
