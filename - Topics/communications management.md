- A systematic approach to defining, managing, and monitoring the official channels of communication within an organization. The aim is to ensure that information flows freely and efficiently between the different levels and sections of a company, thereby improving decision making, motivation, and overall performance. Various processes and incentives can be devised to ensure that information flows in a bottom-up as well as a top-down direction, so that e.g. the experience of shop-floor workers is considered by management. Effective communications management is central to such modern philosophies as total quality management.
