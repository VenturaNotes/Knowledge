- Credit granted to consumers by suppliers of goods and services. This may be granted by the suppliers themselves accepting payment by installments or on deferred terms, or by the use of credit cards and other systems by which the supplier is paid at once by a credit institution, which then collects payments in installments from the customer.

- Short-term loans to the public for the purchase of goods. The most common forms of consumer credit are credit accounts at retail outlets, personal loans from banks and finance houses, hire purchase, and credit cards. Since the Consumer Credit Act 1974, the borrower has been given greater protection, particularly with regard to regulations establishing the true rate of interest being charged when loans are made (see ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE). The Act also made it necessary for anyone giving credit in a business (with minor exceptions) to obtain a licence. The Consumer Credit Act 2006 introduced further safeguards and extended the remit of the Financial Ombudsman Service to include consumer credit agreements. See CONSUMER-CREDIT REGISTER.
