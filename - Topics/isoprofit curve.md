- A curve showing the combinations of two variables that generate the same level of profit for a firm. For a single firm in a model with two inputs in production an isoprofit curve can be constructed for alternative input combinations. In a duopoly model an isoprofit curve can depict combinations of output levels of the two firms that lead to a constant level of profit for one of the firms.
