- (1) Money that a government takes back from members of the public by taxation, especially through the higher rate of income tax, having given the money away in benefits, such as retirement pensions. Thus the money is clawed back from those who have no need of the benefit (because they are paying higher-rate taxes). 
- (2) An agreement requiring the sponsors of a project to repay past profits in the event of a shortfall in later periods. This may be a condition in project financing.
