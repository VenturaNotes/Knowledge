- An assemblage of organisms constituting a primary clade of a domain. It is thus effectively the highest-ranking taxon after domain and has superseded kingdom in many classifications. The eukaryotes are currently placed in four hypothetical supergroups, chiefly on the basis of molecular studies of their genomes. These are the excavates, SAR, Archaeplastida (see Plant sense 2), and unikonts.
