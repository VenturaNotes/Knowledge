- A chapter of the US bankruptcy law by which a firm can apply to the courts for protection against all creditors while it is reorganized so as to enable it to pay its debts; the debtor usually proposes a plan of such reorganization. The argument for such a provision is that it gives better results for creditors as a whole than allowing firms to be forced into liquidation by any one creditor.
