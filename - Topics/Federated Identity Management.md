- Federated identity management (FIM) is a system that allows for the identification of information to be shared across entities and trust domains. With FIM, users at separate enterprises can use the same identity data, including names, pictures, and badges, to access apps, software, and other resources. Each enterprise maintains its system, but all the systems are interlinked through an identity provider that stores all access credentials and serves as the authentication gatekeeper.
