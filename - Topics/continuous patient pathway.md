- the route that a patient takes through the health-care system, from first admission to a hospital or treatment centre to final discharge. This may consist of one or more spells in particular hospitals and one or more finished consultant episodes. For example, a patient admitted to a district general hospital, transferred to a tertiary hospital for a specialist procedure, and then transferred back to the district general hospital for recovery would experience one continuous patient pathway but three spells.
