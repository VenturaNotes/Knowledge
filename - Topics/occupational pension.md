- A pension provided by an employer for former employees. In a contributory pension scheme employees are required to contribute part of their pay to help meet the cost of the scheme; in a noncontributory scheme the entire cost is borne by the employer. Fully funded schemes build up sufficient funds to meet the actuarially expected cost of pensions. In unfunded schemes the pensions are paid for out of current revenue by the employer. In partially funded schemes there is a fund, but not one sufficient to meet the full forecasted cost of pensions due. Defined contribution schemes fix the contributions by employers and employees to the pension fund: pensions depend on the financial performance of the fund. Defined benefit schemes fix what the pensioners receive, the employer making up any deficiency in the fund's financial performance. Defined benefit schemes may fix benefits in cash terms, or index-link them, either to prices or current earnings.
