A widely used questionnaire, originally designed to be administered by a trained test administrator but widely used as a self-report scale, comprising 21 items, each describing a behavioral manifestation of depression together with between four and six self-evaluative statements from which the respondent is asked to choose the one that is most applicable. The questionnaire provides a total score between 0 and 60 indicating the depth of the respondent's depression. A revised version called the Beck Depression Inventory-II was published in 1993. Other Beck inventories designed to measure suicide ideation, hopelessness, and anxiety have also been constructed. Compare Hamilton Depression Rating Scale.
