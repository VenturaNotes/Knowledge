- $n$. The proposition that the human auditory system responds to a complex sound by generating sensations of the separate components of the sound rather than a sensation of a single integrated sound; thus when we listen to an orchestra we hear the separate instruments although the ears receive only a single complex sound wave. See also Fourier analysis. \[Named after the German physicist Georg Simon Ohm (1784-1854) who formulated it in 1843]
