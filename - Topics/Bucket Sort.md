- An external sort in which the records to be sorted are grouped in some way, and each group stored in a distinct bucket. Different buckets will probably be stored on different storage devices. If searching is to be performed on the data, then each bucket should contain records with the same hash value (see HASHING). In this way all the records that might contain the required key may be fetched from the external memory at once.
