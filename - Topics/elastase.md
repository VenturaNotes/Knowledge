- $n$. an enzyme that breaks down various proteins including elastin, which has a role in the connective tissue matrix. Pancreatic elastase, secreted by the pancreas, is not degraded in the small or large intestine; therefore its concentration in the stools expresses the functioning of the pancreas, which is the basis for the faecal pancreatic elastase test. In patients who have suspected pancreatic insufficiency, faecal pancreatic elastase is suppressed or absent. Patients at risk include those with chronic pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, pancreatic cancer, or previous pancreatic surgery.
