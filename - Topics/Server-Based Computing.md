- Server-based computing (SBC) is a type of computing where the processing and storage are done on a remote or shared server. Client-side software, such as web browsers, access this data over a network. This allows users to share files and applications between many devices or users. SBC can be used for both personal and business purposes. For example, you could use SBC to store your family photos on a central server, making them accessible from any device.
