- (McKinsey Matrix) A tool for analysing the relative strengths of brands or business units within a large diversified corporation. A range of measures are used to score items on each of two dimensions: (i) the attractiveness of the industry or market; and (ii) the strength of the product or business. On this basis, each item is assigned to one of nine cells on a two-dimensional grid:
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-06-17 at 2.02.21 AM.png|300]]
		- Business Strength
		- Industry Attractiveness
- The corporation should invest in items that appear towards the top lefthand corner of the grid and consider disinvesting from those towards the bottom right-hand corner. Those that appear between these extremes require the most careful appraisal.
- To add further dimensions, individual items are usually shown on the grid as pie charts of varying size; the diameter of the pie indicates the size of the relevant market and the size of the 'slice' indicates the market share.
- The GE matrix is essentially a more sophisticated development of the Boston matrix. It is so-called because it was first used by the management consultants McKinsey in their work for General Electric (GE).
