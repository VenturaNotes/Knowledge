## Source [^1]
- Transport Layer Security (TLS) refers to a security protocol that is used to transfer data over a computer network. It succeeded Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) as the standard security protocol when moving data. When used properly, it can ensure data transfer while maintaining privacy. Many versions of TLS have been implemented since the creation of version 1.0. The latest version is 1.3, which is still very active across the internet.
## Source[^2]
- (TLS) A commonly used encryption technique for scrambling data, such as credit card numbers, as they are passed across the Internet from a web browser to a web server. TLS was developed as a successor to the secure sockets layer (SSL) protocol.
