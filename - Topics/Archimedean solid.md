- A convex polyhedron is called semi-regular if the faces are regular polygons, though not all congruent, and if the vertices are all alike, in the sense that the different kinds of face are arranged in the same order around each vertex. Right-regular prisms with square side faces and right-regular antiprisms whose side faces are equilateral triangles are semi-regular. Apart from these, there are thirteen semi-regular polyhedra, known as the Archimedean solids. These include the truncated tetrahedron, the truncated cube, the cuboctahedron, and the icosidodecahedron.
