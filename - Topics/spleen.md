- $n$. a large dark-red ovoid organ situated on the left side of the body below and behind the stomach. It is enclosed within a fibrous capsule that extends into the spongy interior $\textendash$ the splenic pulp $\textendash$ to form a supportive framework. The pulp consists of aggregates of lymphoid tissue (white pulp) within a meshwork of reticular fibres packed with red blood cells (red pulp). The spleen is a major component of the reticuloendothelial system, producing lymphocytes in the newborn and containing phagocytes, which remove worn-out red blood cells and other foreign bodies from the bloodstream. It also acts as a reservoir for blood and, in the fetus, as a source of red blood cells. Anatomical name: lien. $\textemdash$splenic adj.
