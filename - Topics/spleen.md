- $n$. a large dark-red ovoid organ situated on the left side of the body below and behind the stomach. It is enclosed within a fibrous capsule that extends into the spongy interior $\textendash$ the splenic pulp $\textendash$ to form a supportive framework. The pulp consists of aggregates of lymphoid tissue (white pulp) within a meshwork of reticular fibres packed with red blood cells (red pulp). The spleen is a major component of the reticuloendothelial system, producing lymphocytes in the newborn and containing phagocytes, which remove worn-out red blood cells and other foreign bodies from the bloodstream. It also acts as a reservoir for blood and, in the fetus, as a source of red blood cells. Anatomical name: lien. $\textemdash$splenic adj.

- A vertebrate lymphoid organ, lying behind the stomach, in which worn-out red blood cells (erythrocytes) are collected and disposed of. It forms part of the peripheral lymphoid system and is a site where antigen-presenting cells stimulate lymphocytes to mount adaptive immune responses against invading pathogens. The spleen consists chiefly of red pulp comprising numerous sinuses where erythrocytes are stored and old ones destroyed. Their remnants are ingested and degraded by macrophages. Interspersed among the red pulp are areas of white pulp. These contain distinct zones of lymphocytes$\textemdash$B cells and T cells$\textemdash$arranged around central arterioles.
