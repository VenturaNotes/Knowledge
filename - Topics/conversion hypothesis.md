- $n$. A conjecture that some errors in judging the validity of syllogisms arise because people mentally translate a premise into one that appears equivalent but actually has a different logical meaning, for example If $p$, then $q$ may be translated mentally to If and only if $p$, then $q$, which could lead to the incorrect inference, If not-p, then not-q.
