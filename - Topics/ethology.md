- The study of the biology of animal behavior. Central to the ethologist's approach is the principle that animal behavior (like physical characteristics) is subject to evolution through natural selection. Ethologists therefore seek to explain how the behavior of animals, both as individuals and as social groups, in their natural environment may contribute to the survival of the maximum number of its relatives and offspring. This involves recognizing the stimuli that are important in nature (see SIGN STIMULUS) and how innate predispositions interact with learning in the development of behavior (see INSTINCT). Studies of this sort were pioneered by Konrad Lorenz and Niko Tinbergen and have led to the modern disciplines of sociobiology and behavioral ecology.
