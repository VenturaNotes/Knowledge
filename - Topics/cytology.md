## Source [^1]
- A common method for determining a diagnosis in the medical world
- Cytology tests use small amounts of bodily tissue or fluid in order to examine certain types of cells
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the study of the structure and function of cells. The examination of cells under a microscope is used in the diagnosis of various diseases. These cells are obtained by scraping an organ, as in cervical cytology (see CERVICAL SMEAR; LIQUID-BASED CYTOLOGY), by aspiration (see ASPIRATION CYTOLOGY), or they are collected from cells already shed (exfoliative cytology). See also BIOPSY. $\textemdash$ cytological adj.
## Source[^3]
- The study of the structure and function of cells. The development of the light and electron microscopes has enabled the detailed structure of the nucleus (including the chromosomes) and other organelles to be elucidated. Microscopic examination of cells, either live or as stained sections on a slide, is also used in the detection and diagnosis of various diseases, especially cancer. Fluorescent markers are now commonly used to distinguish particular cellular components (see FLUORESCENT PROTEIN).
