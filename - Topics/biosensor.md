## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A device that uses an immobilized agent to detect or measure a chemical compound. The agents include enzymes, antibiotics, organelles, or whole cells. A reaction between the immobilized agent and the molecule being analysed is transduced into an electronic signal. This signal may be produced in response to the presence of a reaction product, the movement of electrons, or the appearance of some other factor (e.g. light). Biosensors are used in diagnostic tests: these allow quick, sensitive, and specific analysis of a wide range of biological products, including antibiotics, vitamins, and other important biomolecules (such as glucose), as well as the determination of certain xenobiotics, such as synthetic organic compounds.
