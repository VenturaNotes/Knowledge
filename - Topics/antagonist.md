- (1) a muscle whose action (contraction) opposes that of another muscle (called the agonist or prime mover). Antagonists relax to allow the agonists to effect movement. 
- (2) a drug or other substance with opposite action to that of another drug or natural body chemical, which it inhibits. Examples are the antimetabolites. $\textemdash$ antagonism $n$.
## Source[^2]
- A substance (e.g. a hormone or drug) that inhibits the effect of an agonist in such a way that the combined biological effect of the two substances becomes smaller than the sum of their individual effects. Competitive antagonists act by binding to agonist receptors, while noncompetitive antagonists do not bind to the same receptor sites as the agonist. A functional antagonist binds to other receptors that elicit an effect opposite to that of the agonist.
