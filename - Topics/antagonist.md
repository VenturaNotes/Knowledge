- n. 
- (1) a muscle whose action (contraction) opposes that of another muscle (called the agonist or prime mover). Antagonists relax to allow the agonists to effect movement. 
- (2) a drug or other substance with opposite action to that of another drug or natural body chemical, which it inhibits. Examples are the antimetabolites. $\textemdash$ antagonism $n$.
## Source[^2]
- A substance (e.g. a hormone or drug) that inhibits the effect of an agonist in such a way that the combined biological effect of the two substances becomes smaller than the sum of their individual effects. Competitive antagonists act by binding to agonist receptors, while noncompetitive antagonists do not bind to the same receptor sites as the agonist. A functional antagonist binds to other receptors that elicit an effect opposite to that of the agonist.

- $n$. 
- (1) An opponent or adversary in a struggle. Compare AGonist (1). 
- (2) A muscle that opposes the action of another. Compare AGonist (2). 
- (3) A substance that depresses the effect of an agonist (3) either by acting at different neuroreceptor sites from those of the agonist (a non-competitive antagonist) or by binding to the same neuroreceptors as the agonist without exciting or inhibiting the postsynaptic neurons (a competitive antagonist, also called a receptor blocker), a typical example being the narcotic antagonist naloxone, which binds to neuroreceptors in the brain that would otherwise be occupied by morphine, and thereby prevents morphine from exerting its usual effects. See also dopamine antagonist. Compare AGonist (3). \[From Greek anti against + agon a festival of competitions, from agein to lead]
