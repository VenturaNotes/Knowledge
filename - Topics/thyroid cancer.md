- any malignant tumor of the thyroid gland, of which there are four main types: papillary, follicular, medullary, and anaplastic. These have characteristic presentations and degrees of malignancy, ranging from the papillary tumours, which tend to be relatively low-grade and in some cases can be treated by surgery and thyroxine suppression, to highly aggressive anaplastic tumors, which tend to present with locally advanced disease that is inoperable and unresponsive to radiotherapy or chemotherapy. See also HÃ¼rthle Cell tumor.
