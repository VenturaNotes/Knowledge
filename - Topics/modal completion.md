- $n$. Perceptual filling-in in which the completed regions of the image are perceptually similar to the rest of the image, having the same properties or modes, such as linearity or brightness. This type of perceptual completion, resulting in the formation of visible surfaces and/or contours in image regions where these properties are not specified locally, is apparent, for example, in the illusory contours and uniform brightness of a Kanizsa triangle. See also artificial scotoma. Compare amodal completion. \[From Latin modus a measure or manner + -alis of or relating to]
