- The theory that business cycles are caused by fluctuations in credit. Booms occur because banks and other lenders become overoptimistic in granting credit. At some stage their mistakes lead to defaults and a loss of confidence, resulting in a depression. During the depression lenders are over-cautious, and bad debts are gradually written off. After a while bankers recover from the shock and start lending again, which leads to a recovery, in the course of which they once again become overoptimistic, leading to the next cycle.
