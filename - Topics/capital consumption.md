The passage of time also reduces its expected remaining useful life; and it may become obsolete through advances in technology or changes in factor prices.

- The total depreciation in the value of the capital goods in an economy during a specified period. It is difficult to calculate this figure, but it is needed as it has to be deducted from the gross national product (GNP) and the gross domestic product (GDP) to obtain the net figures.
