- In national accounts, the amount by which gross investment exceeds net investment, i.e. the same as replacement investment. Loss of value of capital equipment is due to use, ageing, or obsolescence. Part of the value of the capital stock owned by an enterprise is lost in any period through wear and tear in use. The passage of time also reduces its expected remaining useful life; and it may become obsolete through advances in technology or changes in factor prices.
