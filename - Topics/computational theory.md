- $n$. A formal analysis of perception, especially one based on the theory of vision pioneered in the late 1970s by the English psychologist David Courtenay Marr (1945-80), which seeks to explain how the pattern of light falling on the retinas of the eyes is transformed into an internal representation (2) of the shapes, colors, and movements of what is observed, the three stages in the process being the primal sketch, the 2Â½-D sketch, and the 3-D model description. See also EYE-HEAD MOVEMENT SYSTEM, GENERALIZED CONE, IMAGE-RETINAL SYSTEM, ZERO-CROSSING.
