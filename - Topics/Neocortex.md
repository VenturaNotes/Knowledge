- (neopallium; isocortex) The part of the cerebral cortex of the vertebrate brain that has evolved most recently, and is most highly developed in mammals. In humans and other primates it forms a surface layer covering most of the forebrain and comprises six layers of neurons with a multitude of interconnections; it is greatly folded to vastly increase its surface area. The expansion of the neocortex in primates is thought to be correlated with their complex social behaviour. It is the major centre for the coordination of sensory and motor information. See CEREBRUM.

- $n$. The most recently evolved part of the cerebral cortex, composed of six layers of cells, including the lateral surfaces of the frontal, parietal, temporal, and occipital lobes. The older parts of the cerebral cortex, all with fewer than six layers and collectively called the allocortex, are the palaeocortex or olfactory cortex at the front of each temporal lobe, the mesocortex mainly in the cingulate gyrus, and the archaecortex mainly in the hippocampus, which is the oldest of all. In humans, over 90 per cent of the cerebral cortex is neocortex (see also PROGRESSION INDEX). Also called isocortex, neencephalon, or neopallium. \[From Greek neos new + Latin cortex bark or outer layer]
