- $n$. prolonged painful contraction of a muscle. It is sometimes caused by an imbalance of calcium and potassium in the body, but is more often a result of fatigue, imperfect posture, or stress. Spasm in the muscles making it impossible to perform a specific task but allowing the use of these muscles for any other movement is called occupational cramp. It most often affects the hand muscles for writing (writer's cramp), a form of dystonia.
