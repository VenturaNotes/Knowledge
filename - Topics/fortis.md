- adj. Of or relating to a consonant speech sound articulated with considerable muscular tension of the organs of speech and strong breath pressure, such as the initial phonemes in pie, tea, key, chew, jaw, fee, thigh, see, and shoe. In English, a vowel is shortened when it occurs immediately before a fortis consonant, and this is called pre-fortis clipping. Compare LENIS. \[From Latin fortis strong]
