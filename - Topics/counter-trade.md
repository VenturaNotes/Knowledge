- A form of international trade in which one country buys goods and services from another country without money being involved, in exchange for other goods and services (barter), or for a promise of future purchase of a specific product (counter-purchase). Another form of countertrade is buyback, when a multinational firm accepts from the host country part of the output as a partial payment for building a plant in this country. An example of counter-trade was the oil-for-food programme between India and Iraq. Counter-trade often occurs in military sales and with the countries that lack hard currency, such as the formerly planned economies of Eastern Europe.
