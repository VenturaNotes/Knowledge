- It's an insulating layer that surrounds the axons of neurons
- It's white
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a complex material formed of protein and phospholipid that is laid down as a sheath surrounding and insulating the axons of certain neurons, known as myelinated (or medullated) nerve fibers. The material is produced and laid down in concentric layers by Schwann cells at regular intervals along the nerve fiber (see illustrations). Myelinated nerves conduct impulses more rapidly than nonmyelinated nerves.

## Source[^3]
- A phospholipid produced by the Schwann cells of the nervous system. Myelin forms an insulating layer around the nerve fibers (see MYELIN SHEATH).
## Source[^4]
- $n$. White lipid-based tissue produced by oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system and by Schwann cells in the peripheral nervous system, forming a protective covering called a myelin sheath around the neural axons. Damage to the myelin sheath is found in neurological disorders such as multiple sclerosis. See also neurolemma. myelinated adj. Having a myelin sheath. \[From Greek myelos marrow or spinal cord + -in(e) indicating an organic compound]
