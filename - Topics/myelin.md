- $n$. a complex material formed of protein and phospholipid that is laid down as a sheath surrounding and insulating the axons of certain neurons, known as myelinated (or medullated) nerve fibres. The material is produced and laid down in concentric layers by Schwann cells at regular intervals along the nerve fibre (see illustrations). Myelinated nerves conduct impulses more rapidly than nonmyelinated nerves.
