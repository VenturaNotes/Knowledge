- A form of entrepreneurship in which a company or organization is established to further a defined social goal rather than to pursue maximum profit. Typically, a social entrepreneur recognizes a need not currently met by for-profit business, government, or charity and aims to fill this gap through his or her own initiative, rather than by campaigning against existing business practices or public policy.
