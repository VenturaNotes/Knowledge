## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- (ribonucleic acid) a nucleic acid, occurring in the nucleus and cytoplasm of cells, that is concerned with synthesis of proteins (see messenger RNA; ribosome; transfer RNA; translation). In some viruses RNA is the genetic material. The RNA molecule is a single strand made up of units called nucleotides.
## Source[^2]
- (ribonucleic acid) A complex organic compound (a nucleic acid) in living cells that is concerned with protein synthesis. In some viruses, RNA is also the hereditary material. Most RNA is synthesized in the nucleus and then distributed to various parts of the cytoplasm. An RNA molecule consists of a long chain of nucleotides in which the sugar is ribose and the bases are adenine, cytosine, guanine, and uracil (see illustration; compare DNA). Messenger RNA (mRNA) is responsible for carrying the genetic code transcribed from DNA to specialized sites within the cell (known as ribosomes), where the information is translated into protein composition (see RNA PROCESSING; TRANSCRIPTION; TRANSLATION). Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) is present in ribosomes; it is single-stranded but helical regions are formed by base pairing within the strand. Transfer RNA (tRNA, soluble RNA, sRNA) is involved in the assembly of amino acids in a polypeptide chain being synthesized at a ribosome. Each tRNA is specific for an amino acid and bears a triplet of bases complementary with a triplet on mRNA (see ANTICODON; ELONGATION). RNA can associate with proteins to form complexes called ribonucleoproteins. See also antisense RNA; noncoding RNA.
