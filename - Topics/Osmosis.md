- The movement of water particles across a membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the passage of a solvent from a less concentrated to a more concentrated solution through a semipermeable membrane. This tends to equalize the concentrations of the two solutions. In living organisms the solvent is water and cell membranes function as semipermeable membranes, and the process of osmosis plays an important role in controlling the distribution of water. The osmotic pressure of a solution is the pressure by which water is drawn into it through the semipermeable membrane; the more concentrated the solution (i.e. the more solute molecules it contains), the greater its osmotic pressure. $\textemdash$osmotic adj.
## Source[^3]
- The net movement of water molecules from a dilute (hypotonic) solution to a more concentrated (hypertonic) solution through a differentially permeable membrane. The distribution of water in living organisms is dependent to a large extent on osmosis, water entering and leaving the cells through their partially permeable plasma membranes. The pressure required to stop the flow of pure water into a solution across a partially permeable membrane is a characteristic of the solution, and is called the osmotic pressure. In animal physiology osmosis is described in terms of osmolarity (see CONCENTRATION), with a net movement of water occurring from a region of low osmolarity to one of higher osmolarity. Plant physiologists use the concept of water potential, so that water moves from an area of high (less negative) water potential to an area of low (more negative) water potential (see also PLASMOLYSIS; TURGOR). Animals have evolved various means to counteract the effects of osmosis (see osMOREGULATION). See also ONCOTIC PRESSURE; TONICITY.
