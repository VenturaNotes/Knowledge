- The movement of water particles across a membrane from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the passage of a solvent from a less concentrated to a more concentrated solution through a semipermeable membrane. This tends to equalize the concentrations of the two solutions. In living organisms the solvent is water and cell membranes function as semipermeable membranes, and the process of osmosis plays an important role in controlling the distribution of water. The osmotic pressure of a solution is the pressure by which water is drawn into it through the semipermeable membrane; the more concentrated the solution (i.e. the more solute molecules it contains), the greater its osmotic pressure. $\textemdash$osmotic adj.
