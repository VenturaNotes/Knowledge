- a disease associated with diffuse atherosclerosis and sloughing of atheromatous plaques in the aorta and main renal arteries. This results in occlusion of smaller arteries and arterioles downstream within the kidney, with ischaemic and inflammatory reactions. This leads to the onset of renal impairment. Precipitating factors include invasive procedures with aortic cannulae, vascular surgery, and therapy with thrombolytics or anticoagulants. Less commonly the condition can occur spontaneously.
