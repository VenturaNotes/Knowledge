- Expanding the product range of a business at the same point in the supply chain. For example, the expansion of supermarkets into non-food items is horizontal integration. Horizontal integration can be achieved within an existing business, by acquisition, or by merger. This may allow cost savings, if there are economies of scale in any of the processes involved, and it allows more customers to be reached. Horizontal integration is contrasted with vertical integration, where enterprises at successive stages of production are combined.
