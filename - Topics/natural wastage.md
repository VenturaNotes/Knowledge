- The method by which an organization can contract without making people redundant, relying on resignations, retirements, or deaths. If the time is available, this method of reducing a workforce causes the least tension. See also REDUNDANCY.
## Source[^2]
- The proportion of the labor force who quit their jobs each year for reasons other than being sacked by their employer. This includes workers who retire, and those who leave for personal reasons. An appreciable percentage of a firm's labor force may leave in any year and this often makes possible gradual reduction in the labor force without the need for redundancies.
