- Let A and B be $m\times n$ matrices, with $A = [a_{ij}]$ and $B=[b_{ij}]$. The operation of addition is defined by taking the sum $A + B$ to be the $m \times n$ matrix C, where $C=[c_{ij}]$ and $c_{ij} = a_{ij} + b_{ij}.$ The sum $A+B$ is not defined if A and B are not of the same order. This operation $+$ of addition on the set of all $m \times n$ matrices is associative and commutative.
