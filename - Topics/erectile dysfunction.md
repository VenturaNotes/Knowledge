- inability in a male to obtain and/or maintain a penile erection to enable vaginal penetration for sexual intercourse. There are many causes and contributing factors; often a combination of physical causes and psychological factors is responsible for the condition. The physical causes include peripheral vascular disease, diabetes mellitus, certain medications, hypogonadism or other endocrine disorders, and anatomical abnormalities of the penis. Treatments that work by increasing blood flow to the cavernous sinuses of the penis include oral sildenafil and injectable alprostadil. Penile prostheses can be surgically inserted into the penis when other treatments have not been effective.
