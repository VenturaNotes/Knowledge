- adj. Abnormally viewed, of or relating to perception of a figure that is revealed one section at a time through a narrow slit behind which the figure moves. If images such as simple geometric shapes or letters of the alphabet are presented anorthoscopically, form perception occurs and the shapes of the images are clearly perceived in spite of the absence of any retinal image of the corresponding shapes. The other major example of form perception without a corresponding retinal image is a Kanizsa triangle. See also ANORthosCOPE, ILLUSORY CONTOUR, RETINAL painting. Compare void mode. \[From Greek an- without + orthos right + skopeein to view + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
