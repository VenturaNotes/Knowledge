- (1) (sunk capital) Expenditure, usually on capital items, that once having been incurred can be included in a company's books of account as an asset, although this value cannot be recovered. 
- (2) In management accounting, expenditure that has already been incurred and that cannot be recovered. Such costs are not relevant to any subsequent spending decisions. An example of a sunk cost is the original cost of a machine when the decision is whether or not to replace this machine. Compare RELEVANT COST.

- Those parts of the costs of an enterprise which cannot be recovered if it ceases operations, even in the long run. These include items such as the construction costs of mines or tunnels, or the development costs of industrial processes. The existence of sunk costs tends to produce hysteresis in the economy, and helps to explain the rarity of contestable markets.
