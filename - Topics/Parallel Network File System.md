- A parallel network file system (pNFS) is an architecture for storing data across servers. This is done to provide high availability and scalability. It allows users to access the same content from any device that supports pNFS. This includes Android OS version Jelly Bean (API level 16) or newer devices. pNFSs are often referred to as distributed file systems, and this is because they can be implemented on top of existing storage technologies. They include storage area networks, network-attached storage, and fiber channel fabric controllers. A parallel network file system has many benefits over traditional file systems.
