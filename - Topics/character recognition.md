- A process in which a machine senses and encodes printed characters that are also readable by a person. The characters may be printed using a special magnetic ink and/or a special style of character, but modern software can read good print, in a variety of type fonts. Software is becoming available capable of recognizing hand-written script though this has scope for considerable improvement. See ICR, MICR, OCR.
