- A ratio used to examine the financial structure or gearing of a business. The long-term debt, normally including preference shares, of a business is expressed as a percentage of its equity. A business may have entered into an agreement with a bank that it will maintain a certain debt-equity ratio; if it breaches this agreement the loan may have to be repaid. The debt-equity ratio is now sometimes expressed as the ratio of the debt to the sum of the debt and the equity. See GEARING RATIOS. See also Modigliani-Miller theorem.
