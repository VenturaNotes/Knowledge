## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A basic networking device that connects multiple computers or devices on a local area network ([[LAN]]) by broadcasting data received from any one device to all other connected devices.
	- Essentially acting as a central point where every device receives all data transmitted through the hub, regardless of the intended recipient
- Operates the [[physical layer]] of the [[OSI model]] and is considered less sophisticated than a [[network switches|network switch]] due to its lack of data filtering capabilities

## Source[^2]
- A layer 1 connectivity device that retransmits the data it receives to all of its [[port|ports]]
- Unlike a [[network switches|network switch]], a computer network hub does not break up [[collision domain|collision domains]]
