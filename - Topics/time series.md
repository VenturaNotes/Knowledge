- A set of observations ordered in time and usually equally spaced; each observation may be related in some way to its predecessors. Time-series problems arise in economics, commerce, industry, meteorology, demography, or any fields in which the same measurements are regularly recorded.
- Time-series analysis is based on models of the variability of observations in a time series, by postulating trends, cyclic effects, and short-term relationships, with a view to understanding the causes of variation and to improving forecasting (see also PERIODOGRAM).
- Autoregression is the use of regression analysis to relate observations to their predecessors. Moving-average methods use the means of neighboring observations to reveal underlying trends. Autoregression and moving averages are combined in ARMA (or Box-Jenkins) forecasting techniques.
- Cyclic influences may be of known period (months in a year or days in a week) and data may be seasonally adjusted on the basis of long-term means. Cyclic influences of unknown period may be studied by spectral analysis.
- Analogous techniques may be used for data regularly ordered in space rather than time.
