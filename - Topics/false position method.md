- (Latin: regula falsi) An iterative method for finding a root of the nonlinear equation $f(x)=0$. It employs the same formula as the secant method, but retains at each stage the two most recent estimates that bracket the root in order to guarantee convergence. Modifications to this general strategy are required to avoid one end-point remaining fixed and slow convergence. The resulting methods are both fast and reliable.
