- Improvements in technical knowledge that allow more output to be obtained from given inputs without the need to invest in new equipment. The technical progress is disembodied because it is not determined by a characteristic or feature of any particular piece of equipment. In contrast, with embodied technical progress the improved technique is built into new equipment.
