- A diagrammatic representation of the amount of energy, measured in kilojoules per square metre per year ( $\mathrm{kJ}~ \mathrm{m}^{-2} ~\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$), available at ascending trophic levels of a food chain in a particular habitat (see illustration). A pyramid of energy is the most accurate representation of the energy flow through a food chain as it indicates how much energy is lost at each trophic level (through respiration, etc.). See also bomb calorimeter. Compare PYRAMID OF BIOMASS; PYRAMID OF NUMBERS.
