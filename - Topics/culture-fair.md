- adj. Of or relating to a psychometric test that is fair and appropriate for respondents of all cultures or subcultures. Non-verbal tests of intelligence, such as Raven's Progressive Matrices, the Cattell Culture-Fair Test, the Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, or the Porteus Maze Test, are generally considered more culture-fair than verbal and information-based tests and subtests, but culture-fairness is a matter of degree, and no IQ test could be entirely culture-free unless it were based on purely biological measures such as properties of event-related potentials. See also CHOICE REACTION TIME, INSPECTION TIME, NERVE CONDUCTION VELOCITY, N140, PROCESSING SPEED, P200, STRING LENGTH. culture-fairness $n$.
