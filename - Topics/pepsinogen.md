- The inactive precursor of the enzyme pepsin. Pepsinogen is secreted into the stomach lumen by chief cells in gastric glands situated within the lining of the vertebrate stomach. In the lumen it is converted to pepsin by hydrochloric acid and also by the action of pepsin itself, in a self-perpetuating chain reaction.
