- A whitelist is a term used to describe a list of entities such as email addresses, domain names, applications, or IP addresses that have been approved to access a specific sector of the computing world, such as a mail server, router, or firewall. In the business world, IT administrators typically use whitelists to protect computer networks from cyberthreats or from accessing inappropriate content on the internet. When creating a whitelist, IT administrators often compile a list of allowed applications, sources, and destinations that employees may need to access, blocking any other service requests that are not represented on this list.
