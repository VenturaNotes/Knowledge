- a syndrome produced by proximal narrowing of the subclavian artery. There are no symptoms at rest, but when the affected arm is exercised blood is diverted to the arm down the main subclavian artery, away from smaller branches that arise just beyond the narrowing (i.e. 'stolen' from these branches). If branches to the brain are affected, syncope may result. The syndrome may result in chest pain in people in whom an internal mammary artery branch of the subclavian artery has been used to bypass a coronary narrowing (see CORONARY ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT).
