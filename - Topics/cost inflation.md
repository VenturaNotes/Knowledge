- In Keynesian economics inflation due to increases in particular prices or wage rates being passed round the economy. Increases in costs cause producers to raise prices; increases in prices cause workers to demand higher wages; and increases in wages in one occupation lead to demands for increases in others to restore differentials. The cumulative effect of all these processes leads to a cost-inflationary spiral, which it is extremely difficult to stop. See also DEMAND INFLATION; WAGE-PRICE SPIRAL.
