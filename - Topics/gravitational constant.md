- The constant of proportionality, denoted by G, that occurs in the inverse square law of gravitation. Its value is dependent on the assumption that the gravitational mass and the inertial mass of a particle to have the same value. The dimensions of G are $L^3M^{-1}T^{-2}$, and its value is $6.672*10^{-11}Nm^2kg^{-2}$
