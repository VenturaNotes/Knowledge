- $n$. a defect of vision in which the image of an object is distorted because not all the light rays come to a focus on the retina. Some parts of the object may be in focus but light from other parts may be focused in front of or behind the retina. This is usually due to irregular curvature of the cornea and/or lens (see refraction), whose surface resembles part of the surface of an egg (rather than a sphere). The defect can be corrected by wearing cylindrical lenses (or cylinders), which produce exactly the opposite degree of distortion and thus cancel out the distortion caused by the eye itself. $\textemdash$ astigmatic adj.
