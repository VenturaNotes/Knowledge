- $n$. a defect of vision in which the image of an object is distorted because not all the light rays come to a focus on the retina. Some parts of the object may be in focus but light from other parts may be focused in front of or behind the retina. This is usually due to irregular curvature of the cornea and/or lens (see refraction), whose surface resembles part of the surface of an egg (rather than a sphere). The defect can be corrected by wearing cylindrical lenses (or cylinders), which produce exactly the opposite degree of distortion and thus cancel out the distortion caused by the eye itself. $\textemdash$ astigmatic adj.
## Source[^2]
- A lens defect in which rays in one plane are in focus when those in another plane are not. The eye can suffer from astigmatism, usually when the cornea is not spherical. It is corrected by using an anastigmatic lens, which has different radii of curvature in the vertical and horizontal planes.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A defect in a lens or mirror in which rays of light from a single point do not all focus at the same point but are drawn into a line; hence a visual defect resulting from astigmatism of the crystalline lens of the eye, characterized by lines oriented in a certain direction being perceived more distinctly than lines in the transverse direction. See also aberration (3). \[From Greek $a$- without + stigma, stigmatos a point or focus]
