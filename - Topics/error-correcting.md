- (error-detecting) A code is said to be error‐detecting if any one error in a codeword results in a word that is not a codeword, so that the receiver knows that an error has occurred. A code is error‐correcting if, when any one error occurs in a codeword, it is possible to decide which codeword was intended. Certain error‐correcting codes may not be able to detect errors if more than one error occurs in a codeword; other error‐correcting codes can be constructed that can detect and correct more than one error in a codeword.
