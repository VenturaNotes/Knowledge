- (OCT) a class of optical tomographic techniques that allows extremely high-quality micrometre-resolution three-dimensional images to be obtained from within optical scattering media (e.g. biological tissue). OCT is proving valuable in ophthalmology, for noninvasive imaging of the ocular structures, and in cardiology for visualizing the interior of coronary arteries using a specialized catheter.
