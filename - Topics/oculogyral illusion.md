- $n$. A visual illusion of motion that arises when a person's body rotates in darkness together with a small light rotating at the same velocity as the body. The impression is created of the light moving horizontally with respect to the body, as adaptation of the vestibular system causes the person to underestimate the velocity of the body's rotation. \[From Latin oculus the eye + gyrus a circle + -alis of or relating to]
