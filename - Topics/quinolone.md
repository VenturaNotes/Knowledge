- $n$. one of a group of chemically related synthetic antibiotics that includes ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, and ofloxacin. These drugs act by inactivating an enzyme, DNA gyrase, that is necessary for replication of the microorganisms and are often useful for treating infections with organisms that have become resistant to other antibiotics. Possible side-effects of quinolones include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, and itching. Confusion, joint pains, skin troubles, and tendinitis occasionally occur.
