- A document sorter is a device that can read information encoded on documents and place them into separate stacks related to that code. [[bank check|bank checks]] are processed in this way
	- #question Are there other types of checks besides bank checks? 
### Details[^2]
- A document sorter typically looks like a large, automated machine with multiple input and output trays
	- #question What is an input and output tray?
- It has sensors, rollers, and sorting bins where documents are directed based on the encoded information
	- #question Does the information need to be encoded?
	- #question Does the encoded information come from the paper itself being used or what is written on there? Is the encoded information a bunch of dots?
- It may resemble a high-speed printer or scanner but with multiple compartments for sorted documents
- A document sorter is considered hardware because it is a physical machine used for processing and organizing documents
	- #question What other documents did it process and organize besides bank checks?
- The information usually needs to be encoded in a way the machine can read, such as [[Magnetic Ink Character Recognition|MICR]] or barcodes. The sorter may act as a decoder by reading and interpreting this information before sorting
- The sorter directs documents into different bins or tays based on the information it reads. For example, checks from different banks or with different routing numbers may be placed into different stacks for further processing
	- #question what is a routing number
#### Examples
- IBM 3890 document Processor

	- This machine reads the [[Magnetic Ink Character Recognition]] (MICR) line at the bottom of checks and endorses them with the bank's information
		- #question How does it endorse them with the bank's information? Does it add information to the paper itself? Which banks used this for checks?
- Quantum DS Reader/Sorter by [[Digital Check Corp.]]
	- A modern replacement for aging full-sized reader/sorter machines. The quantum DS features 12 sorting pockets and a scan speed of 200 documents per minute
		- #question What kind of documents can you use here?
