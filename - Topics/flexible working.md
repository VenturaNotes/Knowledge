- Employees who have children aged under 17, a disabled child aged under 18, or who care for an adult dependent, have the legal right to request a change in their working hours and conditions, including the option of working from home. Although employers have no obligation to grant such a request, they are legally obliged to consider it seriously and to give a written explanation for any refusal. The government has announced plans to extend the right to request flexible working to all employees.
