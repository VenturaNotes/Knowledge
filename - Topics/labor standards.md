- The proposal that access to markets for imports should be restricted to those made by labor whose pay and working conditions are up to some minimum standard. The reasoning behind the proposal is that it would improve labor conditions in less developed countries (LDCs). This benefit may be offset by difficulties in policing so that the labor standards would simply serve as an excuse for protectionism in richer countries, and by loss of employment opportunities which would in any case harm workers in LDCs.
