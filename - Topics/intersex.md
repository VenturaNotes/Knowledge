- $n$. the condition of a person born with physical characteristics that do not conform clearly to those of either sex. An intersex person may have ambiguous genitals, or some sort of mismatch between their genitals and/or secondary sexual characteristics on the one hand and their chromosomes and/or internal reproductive system on the other. The term covers some 30 or 40 rare conditions officially classified as disorders of sex development (DSDs), although the phrase differences of sex development is now sometimes preferred. The extent to which medical intervention is appropriate is a matter of ongoing debate. As a purely physical condition, intersex should not be confused with gender dysphoria.
