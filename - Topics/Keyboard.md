## Source [^1]
- Traditional [[monitor|monitors]] and keyboards use the Simplex transmission mode. In this case, the monitor can only generate the output, and the keyboard can only introduce an input in the system

## Source[^2]
- An array of keys that may be captioned buttons or marked areas on a plane, each of which can cause a discrete signal or action when pressed with a finger. In current systems the operation of the key is detected and turned into a coded electrical signal; in the past mechanical coupling was used to allow depression of keys to directly punch a pattern of holes in a punch card or paper tape, as in a [[keypunch]], or to print a character.
- Computer keyboards consist of the standard typewriter layout-the QWERTY keyboard (in the English variants)â€”plus some additional keys. These can include a control key, function keys, arrow keys, and a numeric keypad. The control key operates in the same way as a shift key but allows noncharacter information to be sent to the computer; the function keys send not one but a whole sequence of characters to the computer at a time, and can often be programmed by the user to send commonly used sequences; the arrow keys are used, for example, to move the screen cursor to a new position. Modern keyboards often include additional 'shift' keys, e.g. Alt, Function, Alt Gr, and Window keys, which operate in conjunction with other keys to produce specific effects.
- The numeric keypad duplicates the normal typewriter number keys and speeds up the entry of numerical data, the layout following a typical calculator keypad. The keypad may be switched to provide numeric or cursor keys by means of the numlock key.
