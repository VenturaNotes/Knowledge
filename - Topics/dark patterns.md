- Elements incorporated in the design of a website with the deliberate intention of benefiting the site's owner at the expense of the user. Dark patterns in the user interface of a site may cause consumers to opt in to services that they did not knowingly choose or, conversely, make it difficult to access an advertised benefit, such as a special offer. Users may be compelled to provide extra personal data, find themselves signed up by default to newsletters and e-mails, or in some cases incur additional hidden costs with their purchases. See also FORCED CONTINUITY.
