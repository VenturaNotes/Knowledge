- Operational technology (OT) is essentially the counterpart of IT (information technology). While IT focuses on data and behind-the-scenes operations, operational technology is centered on more tangible operations. This includes implementing, monitoring and troubleshooting all aspects of communications between physical devices and the hardware or software that they power.
