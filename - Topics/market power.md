- The ability of a transactor to influence market prices, owing to the very large share of the demand or supply in a particular market that this transactor controls. The major UK supermarkets are often said to possess market power of this kind.

- The ability of an economic agent (firm or consumer) to affect the equilibrium price in a market. Market power derives from being large relative to the market, so the N-firm concentration ratio is often used as a proxy. A monopoly supplier of a product has market power: they can set the price that maximizes profit. Similar considerations apply to market power on the demand side of the market. There are several determinants of market power in addition to size. These include barriers to entry, brand recognition, and product differentiation.
