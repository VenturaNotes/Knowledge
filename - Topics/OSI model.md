## Synthesis
### Description
- Conceptual framework that standardizes network communication into seven layers each handling specific tasks related to data transmission and processing
### Seven Layers
- Physical: Transmission of bits over physical mediums
- Data Link: Establishes links between nodes on the same network
- Network: Routes, addresses, and delivers data across networks
- Transport: Ensures reliable data delivery
- Session: Manages sessions
- Presentation
- Application

- Conceptual framework that standardizes network communication into seven layers each handling specific tasks related to data transmission and processing.
	- Handles specific functions and protocols
- Defines seven layers
	- [[Physical layer]]: Transmission of raw data (bits) over [[physical medium|physical mediums]] (cables, radio waves)
	- [[Data Link layer]]: Establishes a reliable link between nodes on the same [[network]]
	- [[Network layer]]: Handles routing, addressing, and delivering data across networks (such as [[internet protocol|IP]])
	- [[Transport layer]]: Ensures reliable data delivery (e.g., [[TCP]]/[[UDP]])
	- [[Session layer]]: Manages sessions and connections between applications
	- [[Presentation layer]]: Formats and translates data for the application layer
	- [[Application layer]]: Interfaces with applications to provide network services
- A conceptual framework that standardizes how data is transmitted over a network. Divides the communication process into seven layers, each responsible for specific tasks
### Lower Layers
- [[Physical layer|Physical]]: Handles transmission of bits
- Data Link: Ensures reliable node-to-node communication
- Network: Manages addressing and routing

### OSI Model rundown (bottom-up)
- Physical: Bits over hardware
- Data Link: [[Frame]] transmission
- Network: Routing (IP)
- Transport: Reliable delivery (TCP)
- Session: Manage sessions
- Presentation: Data formatting
- Application: [[End-user]] [[interface]]
