- (bearer security) A security for which the only proof of ownership is possession of the security certificate; this enables bearer bonds and shares to be transferred from one person to another without registration. This is now highly unusual as most securities are traded electronically with automatic digital registration. Moreover, many jurisdictions have clamped down on the use of bearer securities as anonymity makes them a perfect vehicle for tax evasion and other illegal activities
