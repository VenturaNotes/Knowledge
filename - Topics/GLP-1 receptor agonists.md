- a group of drugs used in the treatment of type 2 diabetes. They mimic the actions of glucagon-like peptide-1 in regulating the rise in blood glucose levels after eating and they also enhance satiety (see INCRETIN). As these drugs respond to a falling blood glucose level there is a reduced tendency to hypoglycaemia compared with sulphonylurea drugs and insulin therapy itself. They are given by subcutaneous injection and three of them are licensed for use in the UK: exenatide (Byetta; twice daily dosing), liraglutide (Victoza; once daily dosing), and lixisenatide (Lyxumia; once daily dosing).
