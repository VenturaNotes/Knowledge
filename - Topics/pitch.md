- $n$. The perceived height or depth of a tone (1), determined largely though not exclusively by the frequency (1) of the vibration that gives rise to it. According to an international standard adopted in 1939, a vibration of 440 hertz is identified as the A above Middle C, and all other notes of the musical scale are defined in relation to it. See also absolute pitch, mel, PITCH PERCEPTION, RELATIVE PITCH.
