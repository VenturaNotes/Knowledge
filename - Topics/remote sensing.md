- The technique whereby sensors located remotely from a computer are used to produce inputs for a digital system. These inputs are then transmitted either by wire or radio techniques to the computer. An example is the use of digital thermometers and humidity detectors in large buildings: the sensors transmit their readings to a central computer that optimizes energy use by regulating heat and air conditioning. Recent developments enable wireless sensors to connect with each other to form wireless sensor networks.
