- Opportunity Management System is a software application that helps businesses manage their sales opportunities. It enables them to track leads and prospects, set goals, forecast revenue potentials, and follow up on deals through automated reminders or notifications sent directly from the system itself. The software can also be used for other purposes, such as lead generation campaigns, which means it's flexible enough to suit all types of industries selling different products/services, too.
