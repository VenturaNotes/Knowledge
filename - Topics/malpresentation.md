- $n$. the condition in which the presenting part of the fetus (see PRESENTATION) is other than the back of the head (e.g. the brow, face, shoulder, or buttocks). Malpresentation is likely to complicate labour and may necessitate delivery by Caesarean section. Placenta praevia, fibroids, ovarian cysts, fetal malformations, multiple pregnancy, and abnormal uterus should be excluded as a cause of the malpresentation.
