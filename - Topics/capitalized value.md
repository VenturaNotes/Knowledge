- (1) The value at which an asset has been recorded in the balance sheet of a company or other organization, usually before the deduction of depreciation. 
- (2) The capital equivalent of an asset that yields a regular income, calculated at the prevailing rate of interest. For example, a piece of land bringing in an annual income of $£ 1,000$, when the prevailing interest rate is $10 \%$, would have a notational capitalized value of $£ 10,000$ (i.e. $£ 1,000 / 0.1$ ). This may not reflect its true value.
