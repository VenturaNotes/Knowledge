- A programming technique used to compensate for the slow and possibly erratic rate at which a peripheral device produces or consumes data. If the device communicates directly with the program, the program is constrained to run in synchronism with the device; buffering allows program and device to operate independently. Consider a program sending output to a slow device. A memory area (the buffer) is set aside for communication: the program places data in the buffer at its own rate, while the device takes data from the buffer at its own rate. Although the device may be slow, the program does not have to stop unless the buffer fills up; at the same time the device runs at full speed unless the buffer empties. A similar technique is used for input. See also DOUBLE BUFFERING.

- The practice of isolating the operations within an organization from the effects of environmental uncertainty. This can be achieved either by holding inventory or by the design of the organization's systems. While a degree of stability may be appropriate in some situations, management theory now favors a close relationship between operations and the ultimate customers, to ensure that the process is both effective in meeting the customers' needs and commercially efficient. See JUST IN TIME.
