- A measure of the linear relation between the value of any item in a time series and those coming before or after it. First-order autocorrelation refers to the relation of each item to those immediately before or after. Positive autocorrelation means that deviations from the mean tend to persist from period to period; negative autocorrelation means that deviations from the mean tend to be reversed. Many macroeconomic time series, such as unemployment or the inflation rate, show positive autocorrelation. See also SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION.
