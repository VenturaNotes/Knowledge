- A measure of the linear relation between the value of any item in a time series and those coming before or after it. First-order autocorrelation refers to the relation of each item to those immediately before or after. Positive autocorrelation means that deviations from the mean tend to persist from period to period; negative autocorrelation means that deviations from the mean tend to be reversed. Many macroeconomic time series, such as unemployment or the inflation rate, show positive autocorrelation. See also SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION.

- (serial correlation) If $\left\{x_{i}\right\}$ is an ordered sequence of observations then the product moment correlation coefficient between pairs $\left(x_{i}, x_{i+1}\right)$ is the autocorrelation of lag 1, and between pairs $\left(x_{i}, x_{i+k}\right)$ is the autocorrelation of lag $k$. The values of $k$ for which the autocorrelation is not negligible can provide important information as to the underlying structure of a time series.
