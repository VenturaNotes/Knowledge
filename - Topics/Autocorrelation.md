- A measure of the linear relation between the value of any item in a time series and those coming before or after it. First-order autocorrelation refers to the relation of each item to those immediately before or after. Positive autocorrelation means that deviations from the mean tend to persist from period to period; negative autocorrelation means that deviations from the mean tend to be reversed. Many macroeconomic time series, such as unemployment or the inflation rate, show positive autocorrelation. See also SPATIAL AUTOCORRELATION.

- (serial correlation) If $\left\{x_{i}\right\}$ is an ordered sequence of observations then the product moment correlation coefficient between pairs $\left(x_{i}, x_{i+1}\right)$ is the autocorrelation of lag 1, and between pairs $\left(x_{i}, x_{i+k}\right)$ is the autocorrelation of lag $k$. The values of $k$ for which the autocorrelation is not negligible can provide important information as to the underlying structure of a time series.

- $n$. A correlation between values of a time series and values of the same time series shifted backwards or forwards by a fixed amount, called a lag. A typical example would be a correlation between a migraine patient's daily ratings of headache severity with the ratings one day earlier, each rating being paired with the one given on the previous day. In this case, the rating on the first day is paired with the rating on the second day, the rating on the second day with the rating on the third day, and so on. This is called the first-order autocorrelation, and it tends to be positive if score $t$ tends to be predictive of score $t+1$. The autocorrelation of scores $t$ with scores $t+2$ is the second-order autocorrelation, and so on. See also autoregression, CORRELOGRAM. \[From Greek autos self + English correlation]
