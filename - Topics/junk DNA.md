- DNA that is apparently nonfunctional, insofar as it does not encode proteins or essential RNA molecules, or perform any vital regulatory role, e.g. in controlling gene expression. The term was coined as early as the 1960s and formalized by the Japanese-US geneticist Susumu Ohno (1928-2000) in 1972. Only 1.5% of the human genome codes for proteins, ribosomal RNA, or transfer RNA, with another 5% representing regulatory sequences, roughly $20 \%$ comprising noncoding introns within genes, and a further $15 \%$ being noncoding DNA of unique sequence between genes. The remaining $58 \%$ is made up of multiple copies of repetitive DNA and transposable elements, such as the Alu family. However, projects such as ENCODE have revealed that around $80 \%$ of the human genome is transcribed in at least one cell type, leading to the assumption that much of the 'noncoding' DNA must have some function. But what constitutes a useful function has been questioned; much noncoding DNA accumulates mutations without any noticeable harmful effects, indicating that the base sequence is not critical to its function, or it serves no useful purpose at all. Hence, functional DNA may account for only $8\text{-}14 \%$ of the total. See also SELFISH DNA.

- $n$. Long sections of DNA that consist of highly repetitive noncoding introns and other DNA having no apparent effect on the phenotype but having important uses in genetic fingerprinting. See also REPETITIVE DNA.
