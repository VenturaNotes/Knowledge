- The boundary of the set of points $z_0$ in the complex plane for which the sequence $z_{n+1}=z_n^2 + c$ is bounded. Julia sets are almost always fractals, and vary enormously in structure for different values of c. The Mandelbrot set consists of those c whose Julia set is connected; the cardioid and different 'bulbs' of the Mandelbrot set classify the different possible structures of the Julia sets.
