- (1916-2004) British molecular biologist, who in 1951 teamed up with James Watson at Cambridge University to try to find the structure of DNA. This they achieved in 1953, using the X-ray diffraction data of Rosalind Franklin (1920-58) and Maurice Wilkins (1916-2004). Crick went on to investigate codons and the role of transfer RNA. Crick, Watson, and Wilkins shared a Nobel Prize in 1962.
