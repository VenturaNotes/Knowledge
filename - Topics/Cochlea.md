- $n$. the spiral organ of the labyrinth of the ear, which is concerned with the reception and analysis of sound. As vibrations pass from the middle ear through the cochlea, different frequencies cause particular regions of the basilar membrane to vibrate: high notes cause vibration in the region nearest the middle ear; low notes cause vibration in the region nearest the tip of the spiral. The organ of Corti, which lies within a central triangular membrane-bound canal (scala media or cochlear duct), contains sensory hair cells attached to an overlying tectorial membrane (see illustration). When the basilar membrane vibrates the sensory cells become distorted and send nerve impulses to the brain via the cochlear nerve. $\textemdash$ cochlear adj.
