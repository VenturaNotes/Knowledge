- A group of dating techniques for certain rocks that depends on the decay of the radioisotopes uranium-238 to lead-206 (half-life $4.5 \times 10^{9}$ years) or the decay of uranium-235 to lead-207 (half-life $7.1 \times 10^{8}$ years). One form of uranium-lead dating depends on measuring the ratio of the amount of helium trapped in the rock to the amount of uranium present (since the decay ${ }^{238} \mathrm{U} \rightarrow{ }^{206} \mathrm{~Pb}$ releases eight alpha-particles). Another method of calculating the age of the rocks is to measure the ratio of radiogenic lead $\left({ }^{206} \mathrm{~Pb}\right.$, ${ }^{207} \mathrm{~Pb}$, and ${ }^{208} \mathrm{~Pb}$ ) present to nonradiogenic lead $\left({ }^{204} \mathrm{Pb}\right)$. These methods give reliable results for ages of the order $10^{7}\text{-}10^{9}$ years.
