- $n$. difficulty in swallowing secondary to either mechanical obstruction or neurological disease. It can be caused by obstruction of the oropharynx or oesophagus by disease (for example, oesophageal carcinoma) or by neurological impairment of the coordination of the muscles involved in swallowing. Such disorders include motor neuron disease, multiple sclerosis, and stroke. A patient may describe food sticking at the level of the sternum in oesophageal dysphagia (compare ODYNOPHAGIA).
