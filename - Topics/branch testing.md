- A test strategy seeking to choose test data values that lead to the testing of each branch in a program at least once (branching occurring at each decision point). It is equivalent to finding a set of paths through the control-flow graph whose union covers all the arcs of the graph. Branch testing normally requires more tests than statement testing but fewer than path testing. See also TEST COVERAGE.
