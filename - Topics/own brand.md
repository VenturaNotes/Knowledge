- (own label; distributor brand; private brand; house brand) A product sold under a distributor's own name or trademark through its own outlets. These items are either made specially for the distributor or are versions of the equivalent manufacturer brand. Ownbrand goods are promoted by the distributor rather than the manufacturer and are typically $10-20 \%$ cheaper to the distributor than an equivalent brand. Own brands are sold principally by multiple shops.
