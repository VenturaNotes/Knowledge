## Source[^1]
- You can have a [[Proper Subset]] and an [[Improper Subset]]
- Given an improper subset A $\subseteq$ B
	- Every element of A is in B

## Source[^2]
- Transitive Property of Subsets
	- Can have a transitive relation

## Source[^3]
- (of a set $S$) A set $T$ whose members are all members of $S$; this is usually expressed as$$T \subseteq S$$A subset $T$ is a proper subset of $S$ if there is some element in $S$ that is not in $T$; this is expressed as$$T \subset S$$
