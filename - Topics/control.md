- (of a company) The ability to win votes at company general meetings.

- The ability to direct the financial and operating policies of another undertaking with a view to gaining economic benefits from its activities. One company is said to control another company if it holds more than $50 \%$ of that company's share capital, voting power, distributable income, or net assets in a winding-up. If one company has control in this sense over another, the two companies should produce consolidated financial statements.
