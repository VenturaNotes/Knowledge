- A surface is orientable if it is two-sided$\textemdash$such as the plane or sphere$\textemdash$and is otherwise non-orientable$\textemdash$such that the MÃ¶bius band or Klein bottle, which are one-sided surfaces. A closed surface in $\mathbb{R}^3$ has an inside and outside and so is orientable. The notion of orientability can be extended to higher-dimensional manifolds.
