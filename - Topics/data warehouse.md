- A database system that is designed to support data archiving and subsequent analysis and reporting. It contains both current and historical data but does not support the transaction processing that is required for a database handling currently ongoing business interactions.

## Source[^2]
- AÂ data warehouse stores data in a central place so businesses can analyze that data. It holds data from various places, such as:
	- Customer relationship management (CRM) platforms
	- Transaction systems
	- Operational data stores
	- Other databases
- To get information into a data warehouse, data is first extracted from its source. Then, it's transformed into the correct format to analyze. Finally, it's loaded into the data warehouse. SMBs can then compare and analyze the uploaded data via business intelligence (BI) tools for better problem-solving and decision-making.
