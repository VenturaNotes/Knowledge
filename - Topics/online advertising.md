- Advertising on the Internet, whether in the form of display advertising on web pages (typically banner advertisements or popup ads, which appear when a user opens a particular page) or via e-mail, social media, or mobile phones (see MOBILE ADVERTISING). In 2013 it was estimated that $20 \%$ of all money spent on advertising was spent on Internet and mobile content. A recent development is the growth of highly targeted advertising, in which offers and promotions are directed at individual users on the basis of their browsing history (see BEHAVIOURAL TARGETING).
