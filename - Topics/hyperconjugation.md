- (no-bond resonance) The interaction of a functional group with sigma bonds with the pi bonds in conjugated molecules, causing the functional group to act as an additional conjugation in the molecule. The interaction of a methyl group with the benzene ring in methylbenzene (toluene) is a notable example. Hyperconjugation has been postulated to explain the stability of certain entities in organic chemistry and certain effects in stereochemistry. It can be explained in terms of either molecularorbital theory or resonance structures in valence-bond theory.
