- A single or paired bony knob that protrudes from the occipital bone of the skull and articulates with the first cervical vertebra (the atlas). In humans there is a pair of occipital condyles, one on each side of the foramen magnum. Occipital condyles are absent in most fish, which cannot move their heads.
