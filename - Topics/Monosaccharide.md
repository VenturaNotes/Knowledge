## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a simple sugar having the general formula $\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)_{n}$. Monosaccharides may have between three and nine carbon atoms, but the most common number is five or six. Monosaccharides are classified according to the number of carbon atoms they possess. Thus trioses have three carbon atoms, tetroses four, pentoses five, and hexoses six. The most abundant monosaccharide is glucose (a hexose).
## Source[^2]
- (simple sugar) A carbohydrate that cannot be split into smaller units by the action of dilute acids. Monosaccharides are classified according to the number of carbon atoms they possess: trioses have three carbon atoms; tetroses, four; pentoses, five; hexoses, six; etc. Each of these is further divided into aldoses and ketoses, depending on whether the molecule contains an aldehyde group (-CHO) or a ketone group (-CO-). For example glucose, having six carbon atoms and an aldehyde group, is an aldohexose whereas fructose is a ketohexose. These aldehyde and ketone groups confer reducing properties on monosaccharides: they can be oxidized to yield sugar acids. They also react with phosphoric acid to produce phosphate esters (e.g. in ATP), which are important in cell metabolism. Monosaccharides can exist as either straight-chain or ring-shaped molecules (see illustration). They also exhibit optical activity, giving rise to both dextrorotatory and laevorotatory forms.
