- (IMF) An international organization established in 1947 to enhance stability and convertibility in the international monetary system. The Fund assists any member experiencing short-term balance of payments difficulties by supplying the amount of foreign currency it wishes to purchase in exchange for the equivalent amount of its own currency. The member repays this amount by buying back its own currency in a currency acceptable to the Fund, usually within three to five years. High levels of borrowing are conditional on the implementation of IMF suggested policies for a country. The Fund is financed by subscriptions from its members, the amount determined by an estimate of their means. The organization has a weighted voting system in which the larger countries have more votes. The day-to-day working of the IMF is carried on by an executive board representing its 189 members; this is based in Washington. See also CONDITIONALITY.

- (IMF) An agency of the United Nations, founded in 1946 to promote international monetary stability and cooperation. The IMF is financed by quota subscriptions from member countries, partly in gold or convertible currencies and partly in their own currencies. It was intended to promote international trade through encouraging stable exchange rates and providing additional international liquidity to enable countries to avoid the need for trade restrictions and exchange controls. It administered a system of pegged exchange rates, the Bretton Woods system, until this collapsed in 1971. It has also made loans to countries with balance-of-payments problems. Extra liquidity was provided by the introduction of special drawing rights after 1970, and various special facilities have been introduced since. Since the 1980s IMF loans have been mainly to the least developed countries. The IMF organizes regular meetings to discuss world monetary problems, and provides specialist advice on their balance-of-payments problems to members needing loans, sometimes making these conditional on at least part of this advice being accepted.
