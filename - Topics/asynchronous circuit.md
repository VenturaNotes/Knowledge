## Source [^1]
- An electronic logic circuit in which logic operations are not performed under the control of a clock signal with the result that logic transitions do not occur (nominally) simultaneously. In asynchronous circuits transitions may follow one another with minimum delay, but at some cost in circuit complexity and risk of incorrect operation.
