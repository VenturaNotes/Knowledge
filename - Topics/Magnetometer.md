- Also known as a digital compass or magnetic sensor, a magnetometer is a device that measures the intensity and orientation of the earth's magnetic field. A magnetometer can be as simple as a compass or as sophisticated as a vector helium magnetometer, an instrument used on spacecraft. For certain industries, magnetometers are necessary because the degree of magnetism on the earthâ€™s surface can differ depending on location.
