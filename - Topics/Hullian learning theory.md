- $n$. An elaborate theory of learning (1) formulated in 1940 by the US psychologist Clark L. Hull (1884-1952), published in his book Principles of Behavior (1943), and presented in a modified form in $A$ Behavior System (1952). In the final version, the independent variables are stimulus energy $(S)$, work involved in response $(W)$, number of reinforcements $(N)$, and difference between the current stimulus and the stimulus used in training (d); the dependent variables are reaction latency $\left({ }_{S} t_{R}\right)$, response amplitude $(A)$, and number of unreinforced responses required to produce extinction ( $n$ ); and the theory also has scores of intervening variables. The gist of the theory is as follows: learning is represented by habit strength $\left({ }_{S} H_{R}\right)$, the $S$ and the $R$ nestling on either side of the $H$ to symbolize the role of a habit in linking stimuli to responses, and ${ }_{S} H_{R}$ is a logarithmic function of $n$. Generalized habit strength $\left({ }_{S} \bar{H}_{R}\right)$ is determined jointly by ${ }_{S} H_{R}$ and $d$. Generalized reaction potential $\left({ }_{S} \underline{E}_{R}\right)$ is a multiplicative function of ${ }_{S} \bar{H}_{R}$ and three other intervening variables: $_S \underline{E}_R=$${ }_{S} \bar{H}_{R} \times D \times K \times V$, where $D$ is drive strength, $K$ is incentive motivation (determined in turn by $W$ ) and $V$ is stimulus intensity dynamism (determined in turn by $S$ ). Net reaction potential is defined as follows: ${ }_{S} \bar{E}_{R}$ $={ }_{S} \underline{E}_{R}-{ }_{S} \dot{I}_{R}$, where ${ }_{S} \dot{I}_{R}$ is aggregate inhibitory potential (determined in turn by $d$ and $W$ acting via various intervening variables). Finally, ${ }_{S} \bar{E}_{R}$ interacts with behavioral oscillation ( ${ }_{S} O_{R}$ ) and reaction threshold ( ${ }_{S} L_{R}$ ) to determine the dependent variables ${ }_{S} t_{R}, A$, and $n$.
