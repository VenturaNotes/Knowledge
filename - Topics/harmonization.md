- The process of convergence over time of tax rates and regulatory rules in countries belonging to an economic bloc. Harmonization of tax rates was actively pursued as a policy by the European Union (EU). This resulted in the imposition of a minimum value for the standard rate of value-added tax in member states. Currently, the EU supports a process of 'approximation' which means closer convergence but not necessarily harmonization.
