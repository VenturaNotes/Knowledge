- A format is the layout or structure of data saved in a computer file. Data files can be formatted in either plain text format or binary format. Plain text format stores data using the standard ASCII characters, while binary format stores data in binary code (0ʻs and 1ʻs) so that it can be easily read by a computer. A data file’s format tells a program how its contents should be interpreted, retrieved, and displayed on a computer device. Common file formats include image formats such as .jpg or .tif; sound formats such as .wav or .mp3; video formats such as .mp4; .mov, program formats such as .com and .exe; and text files such as .docx and .pdf.
