- a gland that discharges its secretion by means of a duct, which opens onto an epithelial surface. An exocrine gland may be simple, with a single unbranched duct, or compound, with branched ducts and multiple secretory sacs. The illustration shows some different types of these glands. Examples of exocrine glands are the sebaceous and sweat glands. See also SECRETION.

## Source[^2]
- A gland that discharges its secretion into a body cavity (such as the gut) or onto the body surface. Examples are the sebaceous and sweat glands, the mammary glands, and part of the pancreas. Exocrine glands are formed in the embryo from the invagination of epithelial cells. Their secretions pass initially into a cavity (an alveolus or acinus) and then out through a duct or duct network, along which the secretion may become modified by exchange with the blood across the duct epithelium.
