- The price at which a seller makes it known that he or she is willing to sell something. If there is an acceptance of the offer a legally binding contract has been entered into. In law, an offer is distinguished from an invitation to treat, which is an invitation by one person or firm to others to make an offer. An example of an invitation to treat is to display goods in a shop window. See also FIRM OFFER; OFFER PRICE; QUOTATION.
