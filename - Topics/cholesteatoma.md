- $n$. a skin-lined sac containing debris from dead skin cells that grows from the eardrum into the mastoid bone, eroding normal structures in its path. Left untreated, it can carry infection to the brain, causing meningitis or a cerebral abscess. Treatment is by means of mastoidectomy. Rarely, cholesteatoma can arise congenitally in the temporal bone or central nervous system.
