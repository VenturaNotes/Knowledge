- The ways in which large diversified businesses control their subsidiary companies. Broadly, three strategies have been defined:
	- strategic planning, in which the central organization develops a detailed overall masterplan with specified targets for the subsidiaries;
	- financial control, in which the central organization acts as banker to the subsidiaries, setting tight financial targets and regularly monitoring performance;
	- strategic control, in which the central organization sets an overall strategy, but agrees a business plan with each subsidiary and monitors each one against the agreed plan.
