- The tendency for the industrial sector to account for a decreasing proportion of gross domestic product and employment. In advanced countries large improvements in industrial productivity in the 20th century increased real incomes. Consumers and governments have largely chosen to spend these on services, including education, medical care, banking and insurance, entertainment, and tourism. An increasing proportion of economic activity in advanced economies thus consists of services.
