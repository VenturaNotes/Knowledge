- An efficient method implemented in hardware for dealing with many different devices, each of which is capable of interrupting and each different type of device requiring a unique interrupt handler. The interrupt vector is an array of interrupt handler locations. When a device successfully interrupts the processor, it supplies the processor with a reference to its entry in the interrupt vector. The processor then uses this to transfer control to the appropriate interrupt handler.
