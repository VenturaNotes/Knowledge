- In an econometric model, the variable of interest whose behavior the model attempts to explain and/or predict; in other words, the variable on the left-hand side of a regression equation. The variables that are used in an econometric model to explain or predict the behavior of the variable of interest are called the explanatory variables or the independent variables; these are the variables on the right-hand side of a regression equation. A lagged dependent variable can be used as an explanatory variable in a dynamic model.

- $n$. In research methods and statistics, a variable that is potentially liable to be influenced by one or more independent variables. The purpose of an experiment is typically to determine whether one or more independent variables influence one or more dependent variables in a predicted manner. In multiple regression, a set of independent or predictor variables are combined in a linear model to provide a best prediction of a dependent variable, which is sometimes called a criterion variable. See also intervening variable. DV abbrev.
