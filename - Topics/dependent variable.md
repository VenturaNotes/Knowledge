- In an econometric model, the variable of interest whose behavior the model attempts to explain and/or predict; in other words, the variable on the left-hand side of a regression equation. The variables that are used in an econometric model to explain or predict the behavior of the variable of interest are called the explanatory variables or the independent variables; these are the variables on the right-hand side of a regression equation. A lagged dependent variable can be used as an explanatory variable in a dynamic model.
