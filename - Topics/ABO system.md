- One of the most important human blood group systems. The system is based on the presence or absence of carbohydrate antigens A and B on the surface of red blood cells and antibodies against these in blood serum. A person whose blood contains either or both of these antibodies cannot receive a transfusion of blood containing the corresponding antigens as this would cause the red cells to clump (see agGLUTINATION). The table illustrates the basis of the system: people of blood group O are described as 'universal donors' as they can give blood to those of any of the other groups. See also IMMUNITY.
