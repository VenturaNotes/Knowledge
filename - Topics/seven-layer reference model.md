- The standard model for communications protocols that is formally approved by the International Standards Organization acting in concert with the CCITT. The ISO approach identifies the functionality required in terms of seven separate layers, as summarized in the table; the two systems that are to communicate each support an implementation of these seven layers. The layers are conceptually organized with the 'lowest' layer representing the physical link between the two systems, and with successive 'higher' layers progressively being concerned less with the details of the network traffic, and more with the details of the end-user applications that wish to communicate. Each local implementation of these layers is often referred to as a protocol stack. Each layer can communicate only with the layers immediately above and below it in the stack. The set of permissible messages and responses in this local 'vertical' communication is defined by the corresponding interface. The lowest, physical layer, communicates downward with the physical link, and information passes via the link to the corresponding lowest layer in the remote system. The highest layer communicates upward with the local end-user application.
- By passing a message down through the lower layers at the transmitting end, across the link, and up through the layers at the receiving end, each layer can communicate with the corresponding layer in the remote system. The set of permissible messages and responses in this remote, 'horizontal' communication is defined by the corresponding protocol. The entire system is therefore defined by the information that can pass vertically via the interface between adjacent layers in a given stack, and horizontally between corresponding layers in the two remote stacks.
- The primary objective of the seven-layer model is to provide a flexible means of describing the behavior of communications systems, capable of dealing with all existing and future technologies, rather than to provide a specific set of protocols and interfaces. The process of reaching international agreements that meet the conflicting requirements of different groups of end-users, accommodate the interests of competing commercial suppliers, and define technically sound products is slow, often taking several years to reach a final set of recommendations. When agreement on proposals has been achieved, the development of commercially viable products conforming to the proposals is again time-consuming. It is then necessary to test the products for conformance, to demonstrate successful interworking between products from different suppliers, and to resolve discrepancies where systems that each separately appear to conform with the proposals do not interwork correctly.
- Inevitably during this time, individual users or suppliers will have made their own systems, and in this sense the international standards will always lag behind the ad hoc or proprietary systems. Despite this, the model has itself been used as the basis for networks themselves (X25 for packet networks, ISO 8802.3 for CSMA/CD, ISO 8802.7 for slotted rings, ISO 8802.5 for token rings, ISO 8802.4 for token bus, and X75 for internetwork communication), and for some applications such as email (X400), directory services (X500), and manufacturing automation.

| 1     | Physical Layer     | Provides mechanical, electrical, functional, and procedural characteristics to establish, maintain, and release physical connections.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 2     | Data Link Layer    | Provides functional and procedural means to establish, maintain, and release data lines between network entities (e.g. terminals and network nodes).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 3     | Network Layer      | Provides functional and procedural means to exchange network service data units between two transport entities (i.e. devices that support transport layer protocols) over a network connection. It provides transport entities with independence from routing and switching considerations.                                                                                          |
| 4     | Transport Layer    | Provides optimization of available communication services (supplied by lower-layer implementations) by providing a transparent transfer of data between session layer entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| 5     | Session Layer      | Provides a service of "binding" two presentation service entities together logically and controls the dialogue between them as far as message synchronization is concerned.                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| 6     | Presentation Layer | Provides a set of services that may be selected by the application layer to enable it to interpret the meaning of the data exchanged. Such services include management of entry exchange, display and control of structured data. The presentation layer services are the heart of the seven-layer proposal, enabling disparate terminal and computer equipment to intercommunicate. |
| 7     | Application Layer  | Provides direct support of application processes and programs of the end user and the management of the interconnection of these programs and the communication entities.                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
