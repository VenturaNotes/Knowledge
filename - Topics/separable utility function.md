- A utility function is separable if it can be written in the form$$u=U\left(v_{1}\left(x^{1}\right), v_{2}\left(x^{2}\right), \ldots, v_{m}\left(x^{m}\right)\right)$$where $x^{1}, \ldots, x^{m}$ form a partition of the available products. (Assume three goods are available and denote the consumption of good $i$ by $x_{i}, i=1,2,3$. Then $x^{1}=\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right), x^{2}=\left(x_{3}\right)$ is an example of a partition.) The implication of separability is that the marginal rate of substitution between any two goods in $x^{j}$ is unaffected by the consumption level of any good not in $x^{j}$. If a consumer has separable preferences then the demand for a good in $x^{j}$ depends on the expenditure allocated to all goods in $x^{j}$ and the prices of goods in $x^{j}$. This is a form of two-stage budgeting: the consumer first decides how much to spend on each category of goods (meaning, for each element of the partition), and then allocates the expenditure between goods within a category. A utility function is additively separable if$$u=v_{1}\left(x^{1}\right)+v_{2}\left(x^{2}\right)+\ldots+v_{m}\left(x^{m}\right)$$This is a special case of separability. Additive separability is frequently used to represent preferences over consumption at different points in time.
