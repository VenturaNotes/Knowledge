## Synthesis
- The goal of alpha testing is to find bugs and issues early in the development cycle by internal staff before it becomes available to external testers
### Internal Development Team
- Typically includes
	- [[Software engineer|Software engineers]] (developers, programmers)
		- #question are developers and programmers the same thing as software engineers?
	- [[UI-UX Designers|UI/UX designers]]
	- [[product manager|product managers]]
	- [[Quality assurance engineer|QA engineers]] / [[quality assurance tester|QA testers]]
	- [[DevOps engineers]]
	- [[Analyst|business analysts]] (in some cases)
		- #question Why only in some cases?
### Internal Testers
- Internal testers usually conduct testing in controlled environments using the below methods rather than real-world unpredictable scenarios. This is often referred to as [[pre-production testing]], [[staging]], or [[sandbox testing]]
	- #question give an example for structured test cases, simulations, and predefined conditions
	- structured test cases
	- simulations
	- predefined conditions
- Internal testers can be
	- QA teams (dedicated software testers)
	- Developers (who do [[unit test|unit testing]])
	- Other employees (for [[user acceptance testing|UAT]] and [[dogfooding]])
### Description and Real-world conditions
- Alpha testing is done in a controlled, internal environment before releasing software to external users.
	- #question is alpha testing after beta testing? What is the order of these tests? 
- Real-world conditions involve unpredictable user interactions, varied hardware, internet conditions, and diverse usage scenarios.
- Real-world testing includes:
	- [[Beta testing]]
	- [[Field testing]] (testing in live conditions)
	- [[Usability testing]]
## Source [^1]
- Alpha testing is [[software testing]] performed by [[Internal staff#Alpha Testing|internal staff]] or developers before making it available to [[external testers]], focusing on identifying [[bug|bugs]] and [[issues#Software Development|issues]] early in the [[Software Development Life Cycle|development cycle]].
	- #question is alpha testing a type of software testing?
## Source[^2]
- Alpha testing is the initial phase of validating whether a new product will perform as expected.
