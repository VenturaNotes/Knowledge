## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A list, kept by a language translator, of identifiers in the source program and their properties. Before the translator processes any of the source program, the symbol table contains a list of predeclared identifiers; for example, the value of $\pi$ or the largest integer that a system can hold might be associated with particular names by the translator. As translation proceeds, the translator will insert and remove symbols from the table as necessary. The properties of entries in the symbol table vary with both language and implementation.
