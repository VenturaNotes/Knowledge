- $n$. a skin infection caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei. Scabies is typified by severe itching (particularly at night), red papules, and often secondary infection. The female mite invades the skin to lay her eggs and the newly hatched mites pass from person to person by close prolonged contact. The intense itching represents a true allergic reaction to the mite, its eggs, and its faeces. Commonly infected areas are the penis, nipples, and the finger webs. Treatment is by application of a scabicide, usually permethrin or malathion, to all areas of the body from the neck down; benzyl benzoate may be used but is more irritant. All members of a family need treatment, but clothing and bedding need not be disinfested.
