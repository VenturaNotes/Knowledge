- familial unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia: a condition due to a congenital deficiency of the enzyme UDP glucuronyl transferase in liver cells that is inherited as an autosomal dominant or autosomal recessive characteristic. Patients become mildly jaundiced, especially if they fast, overexert themselves, or have concomitant infection. Most patients are diagnosed following investigation of mildly abnormal liver function tests. The condition is lifelong but of little clinical consequence. \[N. A. Gilbert (1858-1927), French physician]
