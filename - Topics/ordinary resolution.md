- A resolution that is valid if passed by a majority of the votes cast by the members of a company, whether in person or by proxy. No notice that the resolution is to be proposed at a meeting is required. It is appropriate where no other type of resolution is expressly required by the Companies Act 2006 or the articles of association. Compare EXTRAORDINARY RESOLUTION; SPECIAL RESOLUTION.
