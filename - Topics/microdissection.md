- $n$. the process of dissecting minute structures under the microscope. Miniature surgical instruments, such as knives made of glass, are manipulated by means of geared connections that reduce the relatively coarse movements of the operator's fingers into microscopic movements. Using this technique it is possible to dissect the nuclei of cells and even to separate individual chromosomes. See also MICROSURGERY.

- (micromanipulation) A technique used for the dissection of living cells under the high power of an optical microscope. It utilizes minute mechanically manipulated instruments, such as needles, scalpels, micropipettes, and lasers. For example, the instruments may be used to remove a single nucleus from one cell and to implant it in another (see NUCLEAR TRANSFER).
