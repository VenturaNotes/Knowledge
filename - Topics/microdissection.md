- $n$. the process of dissecting minute structures under the microscope. Miniature surgical instruments, such as knives made of glass, are manipulated by means of geared connections that reduce the relatively coarse movements of the operator's fingers into microscopic movements. Using this technique it is possible to dissect the nuclei of cells and even to separate individual chromosomes. See also MICROSURGERY.
