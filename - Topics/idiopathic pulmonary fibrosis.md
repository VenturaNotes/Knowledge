- (IPF) a serious interstitial lung disease, formerly called cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (see ALVEOLITIS). It is characterized by progressive fibrous scarring of the lung and increased numbers of inflammatory cells in the alveoli and surrounding tissues. The disease is usually diagnosed on clinical grounds on a basis of worsening breathlessness, inspiratory crackles at the lung bases on auscultation, clubbing of the fingers or toes, bilateral radiographic shadowing predominantly in the lower zones of the chest X-ray, subpleural honeycomb change on CT scanning of the chest, and restrictive lung function on spirometry. It is also called usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP; see INTERSTITIAL PNEUMONIA), a term used by lung pathologists for the most common cellular pattern seen on biopsy. Treatment includes pirfenidone, corticosteroids, and immunosuppressants.
