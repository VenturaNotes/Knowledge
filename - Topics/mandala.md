- $n$. In Hindu and Sanskrit art, a design, usually circular in form, symbolizing the universe. A version of it, comprising a circle divided into four equal sectors (or a circle inscribed in a square, or a square inscribed in a circle), was imported into analytical psychology by Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) as a symbol of the self as a psychic unity, which can appear in dreams or paintings during Jungian analysis. See also individuation. \[From Sanskrit mandala a circle]
