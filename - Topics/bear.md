- A trader who expects prices to fall. A trader on a stock or commodity market who believes that prices are more likely to fall than to rise will sell now any shares or commodities they own, in the hope of being able to buy them back more cheaply when their price has fallen. In extreme cases bears speculate by selling forward shares or commodities that they do not actually hold, hoping to be able to buy them cheap before delivery is due. See also BULL; SPECULATION.

- A dealer on a stock exchange, currency market, or commodity market who expects prices to fall. A bear market is one in which a dealer is more likely to sell securities, currency, or goods than to buy them. A bear may even sell securities, currency, or goods without having them. This is known as selling short or establishing a bear position. The bear hopes to close (or cover) such a short position by buying in at a lower price the securities, currency, or goods already sold. The difference between the purchase price and the original sale price represents the successful bear's profit. A concerted attempt to force prices down by one or more bears by sustained selling is called a bear raid. In a bear squeeze, sellers force prices up against someone known to have a bear position that has to be covered. Compare BULL.
