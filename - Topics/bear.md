- A trader who expects prices to fall. A trader on a stock or commodity market who believes that prices are more likely to fall than to rise will sell now any shares or commodities they own, in the hope of being able to buy them back more cheaply when their price has fallen. In extreme cases bears speculate by selling forward shares or commodities that they do not actually hold, hoping to be able to buy them cheap before delivery is due. See also BULL; SPECULATION.
