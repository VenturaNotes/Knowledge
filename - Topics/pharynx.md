- $n$. a muscular tube, lined with mucous membrane, that extends from the beginning of the oesophagus (gullet) up to the base of the skull. It is divided into the nasopharynx, oropharynx, and hypopharynx (see illustration) and it communicates with the posterior nares, Eustachian tube, the mouth, larynx, and oesophagus. The pharynx acts as a passageway for food from the mouth to the oesophagus, and as an air passage from the nasal cavity and mouth to the larynx. It also acts as a resonating chamber for the sounds produced in the larynx. $\textemdash$pharyngeal adj.

- (pl. pharynges)
- (1) The cavity in vertebrates between the mouth and the oesophagus and windpipe (trachea), which serves for the passage of both food and respiratory gases. The presence of food in the pharynx stimulates swallowing (see deglutition). In fish and aquatic amphibians the pharynx is perforated by gill slits. 
- (2) The corresponding region in invertebrates.
