- (1) inability to pass urine, which is retained in the bladder. The condition may be acute and painful or chronic and painless. Acute urinary retention (AUR) can be precipitated by surgery, urinary infection, constipation, and drugs; spontaneous AUR is usually caused by enlargement of the prostate gland in men, although many other conditions may result in obstruction of bladder outflow. Retention is relieved by catheter drainage of the bladder, after which the underlying problem is dealt with. See also INTERMITTENT SELF-CATHETERIZATION. 
- (2) the ability to store events in memory. If retention is impaired because of a storage defect, the person affected will have difficulty retrieving memories. This is a feature of dementia.
