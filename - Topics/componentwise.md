- Relating to algebraic operations on product spaces. For example, addition of coordinate vectors is componentwise, which means that the $i$th coordinate of the sum is the sum of the $i$th coordinates of the vectors being added. Likewise, the group operation in a product group $G_{1} \times G_{2}$ involves the two group operations of $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ applied componentwise. (Compare POINTWISE.)
