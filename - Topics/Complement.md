## Synthesis
- $\overline {A}  = A^c = A'$
## Notation
- $\overline {A}$ [^1]  = $A^c$ [^2] = $A'$ [^2]

## Source[^3]
- (1) Of a set, S, with respect to some universal set U. The set consisting of elements that are in U but not in S; it is usually denoted by $S'$, $\sim S$, or $\overline S$. Formally, $$S' = \{x | (x \in U) \text { and } (x \notin S)\}$$The process of taking complements is one of the basic operations that can be performed on sets
	- #comment I'm assuming the $\overline S$ is what the glossary meant. It seems like the `overline` was misplaced in the text
- The set difference (or relative complement) of two sets S and T is the set of elements that are in S but not in T; it is usually written as $S\textemdash T$. Thus $$S' = U - S$$See also OPERATIONS ON SETS
- (2) See BOOLEAN ALGEBRA
- (3) Complement of a subgraph $G'$, with vertices $V'$ and edges $E'$, of a graph $G$, with vertices V and edges E. The subgraph consisting of the vertices V and the edges in E but not in $E'$
- (4) See RADIX-MINUS-ONE COMPLEMENT. See also COMPLEMENT NUMBER SYSTEM, RADIX COMPLEMENT
## Source[^4]
- $n$. a system of functionally linked proteins that interact with one another to aid the body's defences when antibodies combine with antigens. Complement is involved in the breaking-up (lysis) and opsonization of foreign organisms. It is also involved in inflammation and clearing immune (antigen-antibody) complexes.
## Source[^5]
- A group of proteins present in blood plasma and tissue fluid that aids the body's defences following an immune response; the genes encoding it form part of the major histocompatibility complex. Following an antibody-antigen reaction, complement is activated chemically and becomes bound to the antibody-antigen complex (complement fixation). It can cause lysis of certain types of bacteria, through the formation of a membrane attack complex, or it can render the target cell more susceptible to phagocytosisâ€”a process called opsonization. Binding of complement components to their respective complement receptors on immune cells stimulates various defence mechanisms.
