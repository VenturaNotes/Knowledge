- $n$. a removable replacement for one or more teeth carried on some type of plate or frame. A complete denture replaces all the teeth in one jaw. It is usually made entirely of acrylic resin. A partial denture replaces some teeth because others still remain. It is designed to restore function with the least potential damage to the remaining teeth. The framework of the denture base is often made of metal (cobalt-chromium) because of its strength. (See also Prosthesis.) Denture sore mouth is inflammation of the gum under the denture, caused by a mixed infection of Candida and bacteria under a poorly cleaned denture or removable orthodontic appliance. Denture hyperplasia is an overgrowth of fibrous tissue covered by mucous membrane, which results from chronic irritation by a denture.
