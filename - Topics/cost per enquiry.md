- (CPE) A commonly used method of calculating costs in direct marketing in which the total cost of the mailing is divided by the number of resultant enquiries received. For example, if 1,000 enquiries were generated by a mailing operation costing $£ 5,000$, the CPE would be $£ 5$ (i.e. $5,000 / 1,000)$.
