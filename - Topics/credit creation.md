- A name for the process by which the banks collectively can make loans in excess of extra base money they receive. If base money increases, through a balance-of-payments surplus or open market operations by the central bank, this will mostly be paid into somebody's account with a commercial bank. The bank concerned can then lend most of the extra money out, which in turn raises deposits at other banks.
- Collectively, if banks hold $100 n$ per cent of their total assets in base money, they can increase loans, and thus total deposits, by up to $£ 1 / n$ for every $£ 1$ of extra base money. How close to $1 / n$ the credit multiplier actually is depends on the proportion of the total money supply which the banks' customers choose to hold as cash rather than bank balances.
