- (RDS; hyaline membrane disease) the condition of a newborn infant in which the lungs are imperfectly expanded. Initial inflation and normal expansion of the lungs requires the presence of a substance (surfactant) that reduces the surface tension of the air sacs (alveoli) and prevents collapse of the small airways. Without surfactant the airways collapse, leading to inefficient and 'stiff' lungs. The condition is most common and serious among preterm infants, in whom surfactant may be deficient. It lasts 5-10 days, with worsening on days 2-3. Breathing is rapid, laboured, and shallow, and microscopic examinations of lung tissue in fatal cases has revealed the presence of hyalin material in the collapsed air sacs. The condition is treated by careful nursing, intravenous fluids, and oxygen, with or without positive-pressure ventilation (see NONINVASIVE VENTILATION). Early surfactant replacement therapy has been shown to reduce the severity of RDS and when given prophylactically it has been demonstrated to improve clinical outcome. See also ADULT RESPIRATORY DISTRESS SYNDROME.
