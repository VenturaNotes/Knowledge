- Product life cycle management (PLM) is a process typically used in industries such as engineering, manufacturing, design, and sales. It includes strategically collecting, managing, and sharing data regarding a product—from its initial conception to disposal—across departments. With PLM software, businesses can better anticipate product issues before they arise. It also aids in processes such as supply chain agility, business continuity, and data governance.
