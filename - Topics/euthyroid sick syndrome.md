- (sick euthyroid syndrome) a syndrome characterized by alteration in the thyroid function tests in which the level of triiodothyronine is markedly reduced, thyroxine is slightly reduced, and thyroid-stimulating hormone is reduced or normal. This syndrome is commonly seen in nonthyroidal illness, due to altered metabolism and transport of the thyroid hormones, but can be mistaken for secondary hypothyroidism.
