- One of the parts of the flower that make up the corolla. Petals of insect-pollinated plants are usually brightly colored and often scented. Those of wind-pollinated plants are usually reduced or absent. Petals are considered to be modified leaves but their structure is simpler. Epidermal hairs may be present and the cuticle is often covered by lines or dots known as nectar guides, which direct insects to the nectar.
