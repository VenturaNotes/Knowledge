- A mechanism that affects the reliability and often brings about the failure of active electronic components, such as insulated-gate FETs (MOSFETs). It is caused by the sudden discharge of energy, usually from the operator's body, and special precautions must be taken to ensure that there is no potential difference between the operator and the devices concerned. See also ANTI-STATIC PRECAUTIONS.
