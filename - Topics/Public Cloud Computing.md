- Public cloud computing is a delivery model where a vendor provides on-demand cloud infrastructure using internet technologies. This infrastructure—typically shared by multiple organizations simultaneously—might include cloud servers and networking resources. The public cloud computing model allows SMBs to scale cloud technology without paying for new infrastructure. Because more than one organization uses IT infrastructure in this model, there are associated security and data privacy concerns . Many SMBs use private or hybrid cloud services to improve data compliance and safeguard business-critical data.
