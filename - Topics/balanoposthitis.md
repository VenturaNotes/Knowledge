- $n$. inflammation of the foreskin and the surface of the underlying glans penis. It usually occurs as a consequence of phimosis and represents a more extensive local reaction than simple balanitis. The affected areas become red and swollen, which further narrows the opening of the foreskin and makes passing urine difficult and painful. Treatment of an acute attack is by administration of antibiotics, and further attacks are prevented by circumcision.
