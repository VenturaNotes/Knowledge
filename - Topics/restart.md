- To set running again after a temporary halt. The term (also used as a noun) applies particularly to the situation in which a transient hardware error has caused the entire operating system (and all the processes running under its control) to halt. In such cases it is often found that only processes that were actively running at the time of the error have suffered damage. The damaged processes must be aborted, but all other processes can be restarted since the resources allocated to them are unaltered, and their process descriptors are still an accurate reflection of their behavior up to the time of the system error.
