- In mechanics, a Lagrange point is a position near two large orbiting bodies where the gravitational forces cancel out, so that a small object at a Lagrange point would be at equilibrium relative to the bodies' center of mass. There are five such points, three of which are collinear with the centers of the bodies and unstable, the other two coplanar with the motion of the bodies and stable.
