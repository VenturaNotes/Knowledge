- $n$. a disorder with a specific cause (which may or may not be known) and recognizable signs and symptoms; any bodily abnormality or failure to function properly, except that resulting directly from physical injury (the latter, however, may open the way for disease). It is often contrasted with illness, where the abnormal symptoms, thoughts, or feelings may be subjective and difficult to assess objectively.
## Source[^2]
- A condition in which the normal function of some part of the body (cells, tissues, or organs) is disturbed. A variety of microorganisms and environmental agents are capable of causing disease, as are mutations of the genes that direct the activities of host cells. The functional disturbances are often accompanied by structural changes in tissue. Compare senescence.
