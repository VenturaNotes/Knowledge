- $n$. a disorder with a specific cause (which may or may not be known) and recognizable signs and symptoms; any bodily abnormality or failure to function properly, except that resulting directly from physical injury (the latter, however, may open the way for disease). It is often contrasted with illness, where the abnormal symptoms, thoughts, or feelings may be subjective and difficult to assess objectively.
