- JK flip-flop A clocked flip-flop that has two inputs, J and K , and two outputs Q and Q-. The truth table for this device is shown in the diagram, along with the circuit symbol. $\mathrm{Q}_{n}$ represents the state of the Q output prior to the current active transition of the clock. The ambiguous condition of J and K both being true, logic 1, causes the device to 'toggle', i.e. change to the complementary logic state, on active transitions of the clock signal. The JK flip-flop (together with the D flip-flop) is the most useful type of flip-flop and is available as a standard integrated-circuit package. See also FLIP-FLOP.

- #question Is it supposed to be $Q-$ or $\overline Q$? Was the first sentence a typo?
