- (FIML) estimation A method of estimation of nonlinear simultaneous equations models based on the maximization of a likelihood function, subject to the restrictions imposed by the structure. The FIML estimator estimates all the equations and all the unknown parameters jointly and is asymptotically efficient when the errors are normally distributed.
