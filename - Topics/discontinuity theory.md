- $n$. A theory of learning propounded by the US physiological psychologist Karl Spencer Lashley (1890-1958) according to which an organism does not learn gradually about stimuli (1) that it encounters but forms hypotheses, such as always turn left, and learns about a stimulus only in relation to its current hypotheses, so that a process of learning can include sudden jumps, as one hypothesis is replaced by another. Compare CONTINUITY THEORY.
