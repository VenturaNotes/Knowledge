- The generation in the life cycle of a plant that produces spores. The sporophyte is diploid but its spores are haploid. It is either completely or partially dependent on the gametophyte generation in mosses and liverworts, but is the dominant plant in the life cycle of clubmosses, horsetails, ferns, and seed plants. See also ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS.
