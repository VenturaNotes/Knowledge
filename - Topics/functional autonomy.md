- $n$. The property of a drive or habit that has become detached from the goal that originally motivated it and operates independently. A classic example is the drive or habit associated with making money, initially to buy goods and services that improve the quality of one's life, but often becoming an end in itself. Many compulsions such as hand-washing manifest functional autonomy.
