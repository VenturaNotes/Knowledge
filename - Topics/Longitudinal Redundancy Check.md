- A longitudinal redundancy check is an error-detection process that determines the validity of transmitted data. It occurs automatically during data transmission and is meant to guard against errors that may occur during the transmission process. These errors are not caused by any user action. Instead, they occur as a result of a glitch that may arise. If the check finds an error, the two streams are simultaneously examined to determine where the error has occurred. The error is then located and corrected.
