- $n$. A storage system for procedural knowledge, information within it being acquired through a form of learning that is relatively slow, requiring repetition over many trials, often involving associations of sequential stimuli and permitting storage of information about predicative relations between events, expressed primarily by improved performance at skilled tasks, often occurring without conscious awareness or understanding of what is being learned and therefore being a form of non-declarative memory. It is distinguished from episodic memory and semantic memory. See also ACT, MIRROR DRAWING. Compare DECLARATIVE MEMORY.
