- The gradual conversion of fertile land into desert, usually as a result of human activities or climate change. Loss of topsoil leads to further soil erosion until the land can no longer be used to grow crops or support livestock. A major factor contributing to desertification is bad management of farmland. Overgrazing of livestock removes the plant cover and exposes the soil, making it vulnerable to erosion. Overintensive cultivation of crop plants, especially monoculture (see agriculture), depletes the soil of nutrients and organic matter, resulting in loss of fertility and increasing its susceptibility to erosion. In many less developed countries it is difficult to control the process of desertification as the livelihood of the people often depends on practices that contribute to soil erosion. Another major cause of desertification is deforestation. Loss of vegetation also results from reductions in rainfall resulting from climate change.
