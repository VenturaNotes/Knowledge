## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Not able to be known without experience, i.e. the truth or otherwise cannot be argued by logic from agreed definitions. For example, Newton's laws of motion describe the way bodies are observed to behave, rather than being deduced from principles in the way that the probabilities of the score when tossing a fair die are.
## Source[^2]
- adj. adv. Of, relating to, or denoting propositions (1), arguments, or concepts that proceed from observation or experience rather than from theoretical deduction; proceeding from observation rather than inference. See a priori. See also synthetic statement. \[Latin: from what comes after]
