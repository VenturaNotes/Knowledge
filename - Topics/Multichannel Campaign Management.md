- Multichannel Campaign Management is a type of marketing that allows businesses to promote their products or services through multiple channels. This includes everything from social media posts, emails, and other forms of digital communication and traditional methods such as print ads in newspapers or magazines' classified sections. Multichannel marketing, often known as cross-channel marketing, allows consumers to complete the desired conversions on whatever medium they are most comfortable with. Giving customers a choice is one of multichannel marketing's most significant benefits.
