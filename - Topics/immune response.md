- the response of the immune system to antigens. There are two types of immune response produced by two populations of lymphocytes. B lymphocytes (or B cells) are responsible for humoral immunity, producing free antibodies that circulate in the bloodstream; and T lymphocytes (or T cells) are responsible for cell-mediated immunity (see HELPER T CELL; CYTOTOXIC T CELL; SUPPRESSOR T CELL).
