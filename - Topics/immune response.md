- the response of the immune system to antigens. There are two types of immune response produced by two populations of lymphocytes. B lymphocytes (or B cells) are responsible for humoral immunity, producing free antibodies that circulate in the bloodstream; and T lymphocytes (or T cells) are responsible for cell-mediated immunity (see HELPER T CELL; CYTOTOXIC T CELL; SUPPRESSOR T CELL).

- The reaction of the body to foreign or potentially dangerous substances (antigens), particularly disease-producing microorganisms, or to cancerous cells. See IMMUNITY.

- $n$. The production of antibodies within the body as a defensive reaction to the presence of an antigen, as when B lymphocytes produce immunoglobulin molecules with combining sites that fit shapes on the surface of the antigen and that bind to the antigen, setting in train a process that can neutralize and destroy it. A primary immune response follows first exposure to an antigen, usually takes several days to develop, and is mediated initially by immunoglobulin M (IgM), whereas a secondary immune response occurs after a second or subsequent exposure, develops much more rapidly, and is mediated primarily by immunoglobulin G (IgG). Also called an antigen-antibody response. See also granulocyte, interleukin, monocyte, prion disease, T lymphocyte. \[From Latin immunis exempt or immune, from in- not + munis serving]
