- $n$. The study of the underlying conceptual questions or principles of psychology. The term was first used in psychoanalysis by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) to denote his own theory of psychology, especially its more abstract conceptual assumptions, in a letter to his friend, the German physician Wilhelm Fliess (1858-1928) in 1898 (Standard Edition, I, p. 274), and later given the following definition in his article on 'The Unconscious' (1915): 'I propose that when we have succeeded in describing a psychical process in its dynamic, topographical and economic aspects, we should speak of it as a metapsychological presentation' (Standard Edition, XIV, pp. 166-215, at p. 181). See also dynamic, ECONOMIC, TOPOGRAPHY. \[From Greek meta among, beside, after + English psychology]
