- In the Indian subcontinent, a unit of $10^{5}(100,000)$, often used in citing sums of money. For example, twenty lakh Indian rupees $=$ IRS 2 million. A hundred lakh make one crore $\left(10^{7}\right.$ or $\left.10,000,000\right)$. Separators are often used to indicate the number of lakh rather than the number of millions, so that e.g. 4.5 million ( 45 lakh ) is written $45,00,000$.
