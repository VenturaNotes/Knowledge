- A confusion matrix is a table layout that allows visualization of the performance of an algorithm. This kind of assessment is commonly used in the field of machine learning and specifically the problem of statistical classification. The matrix begins with classification accuracy, which is the ratio of correct predictions to total predictions made. Calculating a confusion matrix comes in handy because it gives you a better idea of what your classification model is getting right and what types of errors are occurring. Each row of the confusion matrix represents the instances in an actual class while each column represents the instances in a predicted class, or vice versa.

- $n$. A matrix representing the relative frequencies with which each of a number of stimuli is mistaken for each of the others by a person in a task requiring recognition or identification of stimuli. Analysis of these data allows a researcher to extract factors (2) indicating the underlying dimensions of similarity in the perception of the respondent. For example, in color-identification tasks, relatively frequent confusion of reds with greens would tend to suggest daltonism.
