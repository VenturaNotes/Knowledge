- A delivery of goods that has fewer items than invoiced or a smaller total weight than invoiced. This may be due to accidental loss, which could give rise to an insurance claim, or it may be due to some normal process, such as drying out during shipment, in which case the weight on arrival will be used in a final invoice. It may also be an attempt by the seller to make an extra profit, in which case the buyer would be well advised to make a claim for short delivery.
