## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A way of encoding binary signals that aims to achieve the highest possible data transfer rate for a given signal frequency. The name is derived from the principle of operation, i.e. the signal line does not return to zero-make any transition -between a succession of 1 bits. The method was first used for communications signaling in which there was always a 1 bit at the start of a character and thus there was a predictable and acceptable short interval over which the sending and receiving devices had to maintain synchronism independently.
- Many variants of the basic principle have been derived to overcome synchronization problems that occur at high speeds and long bit streams. See also DISK FORMAT, TAPE FORMAT.
