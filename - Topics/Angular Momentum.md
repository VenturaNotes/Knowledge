- Suppose that the particle P of mass $m$ has position vector $r$ and is moving with velocity $v$. Then the angular momentum $L$ of $P$ about the point $A$ with position vector $r_A$ is the vector defined by $L = (r-r_A) \times mv$. It is the moment of the linear momentum about the point A. See also Conservation of angular momentum.
- Consider a rigid body rotating with angular velocity $\upomega$ about a fixed axis, and let $L$ be the angular momentum of the rigid body about a point on the fixed axis. Then $L = I \upomega$, where $I$ is the moment of inertia of the rigid body about the fixed axis.
- To consider the general case, let $\boldsymbol{\omega}$ and $\mathbf{L}$ be column vectors representing the angular velocity and the angular momentum of a rigid body about a fixed point (or the centre of mass). Then $\mathbf{L}=\mathbf{I} \boldsymbol{\omega}$, where $\mathbf{I}$ is a $3 \times 3$ matrix, called the inertia matrix, whose elements involve the moments of inertia and the products of inertia of the rigid body relative to axes through the fixed point (or centre of mass).
- The rotational motion of a rigid body depends on the angular momentum of the rigid body. In particular, the rate of change of the angular momentum about a fixed point (or centre of mass) equals the sum of the moments of the forces acting on the rigid body about the fixed point (or center of mass).
