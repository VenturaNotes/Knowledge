## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A means of modelling objects without boundaries, such as fire, cloud, smoke, gas, and water. An object is represented by a collection of elementary particles whose trajectories are traced. These individual particles move in three-dimensional space and change such attributes as color, transparency, and size as a function of time. Accurate modelling of the physics of the system is not attempted; instead heuristic laws are used to approximate the desired effect.
