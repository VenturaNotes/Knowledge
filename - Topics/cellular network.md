- Any of the radio networks enabling mobile telephones to connect to the main telephone system. Such networks consist of a number of adjacent cells, each containing a transmit/receive station connected to the main telephone network and reached by the subscriber using a portable handset. As subscribers move from one geographical cell to another (e.g. by car), they are automatically switched to receive signals from the new area.
