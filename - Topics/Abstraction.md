	- These icons are a good use of abstraction because they tell us what they mean without needing to use the name / write it
## Source[^2]
- Abstraction is the process of generalizing concrete details, such as attributes, away from the study of objects and systems to focus attention on details of greater importance
## Source[^3]
- Abstraction is pulling out specific differences to make one solution work for multiple problems
- Best definition describing an abstraction
	- Representing 'real world' problems in a computer using variables and symbols and removing unnecessary elements from the problem
	- The process of filtering out unnecessary detail
- [[Digital data]] is represented by abstractions at different levels
- At one of the lowest levels of abstraction, digital data is represented in [[binary]] using only combinations of the digits zero and one
- An abstraction generalizes functionality from specific examples in order to generalize concepts
- The process of developing an abstraction involves removing details and generalizing functionality
