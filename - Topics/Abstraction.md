- Abstraction is focusing on what is important and ignoring what is unnecessary

	- These icons are a good use of abstraction because they tell us what they mean without needing to use the name / write it
## Source[^2]
- Abstraction is the process of generalizing concrete details, such as attributes, away from the study of objects and systems to focus attention on details of greater importance
## Source[^3]
- Abstraction is pulling out specific differences to make one solution work for multiple problems
- Best definition describing an abstraction
	- Representing 'real world' problems in a computer using variables and symbols and removing unnecessary elements from the problem
	- The process of filtering out unnecessary detail
- [[Digital data]] is represented by abstractions at different levels
- At one of the lowest levels of abstraction, digital data is represented in [[binary]] using only combinations of the digits zero and one
- An abstraction generalizes functionality from specific examples in order to generalize concepts
- The process of developing an abstraction involves removing details and generalizing functionality
## Source[^4]
- A set of techniques used to solve complex problems that involves removing unnecessary details so the main processes involved can be easily identified.
## Source[^5]
- Abstraction (from the Latin abs, meaning away from and trahere, meaning to draw) is the process of taking away or removing characteristics from something in order to reduce it to a set of essential characteristics.
## Source[^6]
- The principle of ignoring those aspects of a subject that are not relevant to the current purpose in order to concentrate solely on those that are. The application of this principle is essential in the development and understanding of all forms of computer system. See DATA ABSTRACTION, PROCEDURAL ABSTRACTION.
## Source[^7]
- The process of studying the underlying rules and structures that often connect seemingly different results, and distilling that structure by means of formal axioms. The purpose is to derive, from a set of axioms, general results that are then applicable to any example of that structure. This was a common theme of much of 20th-century pure mathematics, applying equally in algebra (e.g. groups), analysis (e.g. Banach spaces), geometry (e.g. manifolds), topology (metric spaces).
