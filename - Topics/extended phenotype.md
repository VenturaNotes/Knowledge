- The concept, advanced by British evolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins in his 1982 book of the same title, that the phenotype of an organism extends beyond its body to encompass the organism's behavior and the consequences of that behavior. Dawkins cites a beaver's lake as an example. This manifestation of the beaver's instinctive dam-building activities is, he argues, an evolutionary adaptation just as much as, say, the beaver's coat, and is likewise subject to natural selection. Other instances include birds' nests, termite mounds, and spiders' webs.

- $n$. All effects that a gene has on the external world in comparison with the effects of its alleles, including effects associated with such phenomena as co-evolution, inclusive fitness, evolutionary arms races, and reciprocal altruism, all of which have a bearing on the number of copies of the gene that are likely to be transmitted to the next generation. It is distinguished from the conventional phenotype, which is restricted to the gene's effects on the individual organism in which it resides and which excludes extra-organismic effects associated with such phenomena. See also selfish gene. \[Coined in 1982 by the British ethologist Richard Dawkins (born 1941) in the title of his book The Extended Phenotype]
