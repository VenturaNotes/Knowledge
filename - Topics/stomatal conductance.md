- The rate at which water vapour passes through the stomata of a plant per unit leaf area, typically measured in millimoles per square metre per second. It varies between plants, depending on the distribution density, size, and pore thickness of the stomata, and in the same plant over time according to the difference in vapour pressure between the inside of the plant and the external environment and the degree of opening of the stomatal pores.
