- the vast network of cells specialized to carry information (in the form of nerve impulses) to and from all parts of the body in order to bring about bodily activity. The brain and spinal cord together form the central nervous system; the remaining nervous tissue is known as the peripheral nervous system and includes the autonomic nervous system, which is itself divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The basic functional unit of the nervous system is the neuron (nerve cell).
