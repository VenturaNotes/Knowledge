- the vast network of cells specialized to carry information (in the form of nerve impulses) to and from all parts of the body in order to bring about bodily activity. The brain and spinal cord together form the central nervous system; the remaining nervous tissue is known as the peripheral nervous system and includes the autonomic nervous system, which is itself divided into the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. The basic functional unit of the nervous system is the neuron (nerve cell).

- The system of cells and tissues in multicellular animals by which information is conveyed between sensory cells and organs and effectors (such as muscles and glands). It consists of the central nervous system (in vertebrates the brain and spinal cord; in invertebrates the nerve cord and ganglia) and the peripheral nervous system. Its function is to receive, transmit, and interpret information and then to formulate appropriate responses for the effector organs. It also serves to coordinate responses that require more than one physiological process. Nervous tissue consists of neurons, which convey the information in the form of impulses, and supporting tissue. During development neurons compete for survival (see competition sense 2), given the limited availability of growth factors such as neurotrophin. Superfluous neurons and synaptic connections are eliminated $\textemdash$a process called pruning$\textemdash$so that only neurons in the correct location and with the appropriate connections become established. In humans this process, which begins in the early embryo, continues into infancy and early childhood. See also GROWTH CONE; GUIDEPOST CELL.
