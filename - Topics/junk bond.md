- A bond that offers a high rate of interest because it carries a higher than usual probability of default. High-yield or speculative-grade bonds, as they are also known, are defined as those with a rating of Ba or lower from Fitch or BB or lower from Moody's or Standard & Poor's. The practice of issuing junk bonds to finance the takeover of large companies developed in the USA during the 1980s and has since spread elsewhere (see LEVERAGED BUY-OUT). Compare INVESTMENT-GRADE.
