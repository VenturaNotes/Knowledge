- $n$. the process by which opsonins render foreign organisms or particles more attractive to phagocytes by attaching to their outer surfaces and changing their physical and chemical composition. Phagocytic leucocytes express receptors for these opsonins and thereby engulf and digest foreign organisms or particles.
## Source[^2]
- The process in which certain antibodies in the blood (known as opsonins) bind to the surface of an invading microorganism, which renders it more susceptible to phagocytosis by macrophages and neutrophils. Acute-phase response proteins also act as opsonins, as do complement proteins.
