- Data center bridging (DCB) or data center Ethernet (DCE) refers to the practice of enhancing the Ethernet local area network (LAN) communication protocol in data centers. DCB isÂ formerly called converged enhanced Ethernet (CEE). It has one objective: Transforming Ethernet into a lossless network with Layer 2 multipath forwarding. This means that Ethernet can eliminate website traffic loss due to queue overflow and allocate bandwidth to hyperlinks.
