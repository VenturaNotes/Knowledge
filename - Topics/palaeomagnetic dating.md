- A technique for estimating the age of certain rocks based on determining the alignment of their magnetic field, which is fixed when the rocks are formed. The result can then be compared with the established timeline of the earth's geomagnetic reversals to give an estimate of the rock's age. It is useful when dating rock, particularly sedimentary material, that lacks the igneous intrusions required for radiometric dating techniques.
