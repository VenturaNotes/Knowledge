## Source [^1]
- Advanced driver assistance systems, sometimes shortened to ADAS, are technological features that aim to help drivers stay safe behind the wheel. These include many reactive features that help avoid crashes, such as lane departure warnings, blind-spot applications, and other driver aids such as night vision, driver alertness, and adaptive cruise control. ADAS are usually built directly into vehicles, but some of these ADAS features can also be added at a later time.
