- (1) The level of welfare in an economy or society expressed as a function of economic variables. This is the Bergson-Samuelson sense. Social welfare can be expressed as a function $W\left(X_{1}, \ldots, X_{n}\right)$ of the aggregate consumption levels $X_{i}$ of goods $i=1, \ldots, n$. Alternatively, an individualistic social welfare function is a function of individual utility levels. If there are $H$ consumers in the economy, then an individualistic social welfare function is written $W\left(U^{1}, \ldots, U^{H}\right)$, where $U^{h}$ is the utility of $h$. Two special cases are the Rawlsian social welfare function $W=\min \left\{U^{h}\right\}$ and the utilitarian social welfare function $W=\Sigma U^{h}$. These functions capture different philosophies concerning the desirability of equity in distribution.
- (2) A process for aggregating individual preferences into social preferences. This is the Arrow sense. Arrow's impossibility theorem addresses the difficulties of finding an acceptable aggregation process that works in all circumstances.
