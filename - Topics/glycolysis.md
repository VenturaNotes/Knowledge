## Synthesis

- $n$. the conversion of glucose, by a series of ten enzyme-catalysed reactions, to lactic acid. Glycolysis takes place in the cytoplasm of cells and the first nine reactions (converting glucose to pyruvate) form the first stage of cellular respiration. The process involves the production of a small amount of energy (in the form of ATP), which is used for biochemical work. The final reaction of glycolysis (converting pyruvate to lactic acid) provides energy for short periods of time when oxygen consumption exceeds demand; for example, during bursts of intense muscular activity. See also LACTIC ACID.
## Source[^2]
- (Embden-Meyerhof pathway) The series of biochemical reactions in which glucose is broken down to pyruvate with the release of usable energy in the form of ATP. One molecule of glucose undergoes two substrate-level phosphorylation reactions and is then split to form two triose-phosphate molecules. Each of these is converted to pyruvate. The net energy yield is two ATP molecules per glucose molecule. In cellular respiration pyruvate then enters the Krebs cycle and undergoes partial or complete oxidation, ultimately driving an electron transport chain to generate more ATP. Alternatively, the pyruvate is converted to lactic acid or alcohol by fermentation. Other simple sugars, e.g. fructose and galactose, and glycerol (from fats) enter the glycolysis pathway at intermediate stages. Compare GLUCONEOGENESIS.
