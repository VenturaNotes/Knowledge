- Software-defined networks refer to specific types of networking architecture that differ from more generalized networks in that they separate the control planes and data plans. The advantage of this type of network is that it centralizes certain functions of the network. Network intelligence and network state are two common examples. This allows for more efficient use of networking infrastructure by cloud-based applications.
