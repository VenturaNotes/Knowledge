## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The theory, based on an idea put forward by the British scientist James Ephraim Lovelock (1919$\textendash$), that the whole earth, including both its biotic (living) and abiotic (nonliving) components, functions as a single self-regulating system or superorganism. Named after the Greek earth goddess, it proposes that the responses of living organisms to environmental conditions ultimately bring about changes that make the earth better adapted to support life; the system would rid itself of any species that adversely affects the environment. The theory has found favor with many conservationists, and its ideas are embodied in the discipline known as earth system science.
