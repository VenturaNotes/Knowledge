- Fixed costs a business must incur for production to be possible. Overheads may be avoidable in the short run, if output is temporarily cut to zero; or they may be avoidable only in the long run, if the possibility of future production is given up. They may include sunk or irrecoverable costs, which cannot be saved even if the firm is permanently closed down.
