## Source [^1]
- A filtering device that permits only those components in the frequency domain whose frequencies lie between two critical values to pass through with little attenuation, all other components being attenuated. See also BAND-STOP FILTER, HIGH-PASS FILTER, LOW-PASS FILTER.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A type of filter (2) for screening light, sound, alternating current, or other oscillating signals and transmitting frequencies only or mainly within a specified range. A high-pass filter transmits frequencies above a specified threshold, and a low-pass filter those below a specified threshold.
