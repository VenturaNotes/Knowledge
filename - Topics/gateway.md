- A device that interconnects two networks, and whose presence is usually visible to network users (as distinct from a bridge, whose presence is generally not visible). A gateway may be required to deal with one or more of the following differences between networks it connects:
	- (a) change of addressing domain$\textemdash$where the networks have addressing domains managed by separate groups, a gateway may be used to handle address transformations for messages traversing the gateway;
	- (b) control of charging$\textemdash$where the networks have different approaches to charging (e.g. a local area network that imposes no charges connecting to a wide area network that charges on a per-packet basis), a gateway may be used to handle user authorization and usage accounting;
	- (c) change of protocol$\textemdash$where the networks use different protocols, a gateway may be used to carry out necessary protocol conversion (if practicable) or to intercept attempts by a user on one network to use functions not available on the other and to supply suitable responses.
	- The terms bridge, gateway, and relay are among those whose meanings vary between different communities of users at a given time, and within a given community of users at different times.

- A gateway is a computer system that sits between networks. Gateways convert data and information sent from one network into a compatible format for the receiving network.
