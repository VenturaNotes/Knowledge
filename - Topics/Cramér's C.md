- n. In statistics, a measure of association between two categorical variables, applicable to a contingency table of any dimensions, based on the chi-square distribution. The value of $C$ is calculated by taking the square root of $\chi^{2} / N(k-1)$, where $N$ is the total number of scores and $k$ is either the number of rows or the number of columns, whichever is smaller. Unlike the contingency coefficient, the value of $C$ is relatively independent of the number of rows and columns. Also called Cramér's V. See also phi coefficient. \[Named after the Swedish mathematician and statistician Harald Cramér (1893-1985) who introduced it]
