- inflammation and ulceration of the colon, initially starting in the rectum (see PROCTITIS) but ascending to include a part or the whole of the colon (see COLITIS). Its cause is unknown. Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhoea, and rectal bleeding. Acute severe colitis requires urgent in-patient admission for intravenous steroids. Patients who fail to respond to these should be treated with second-line agents (such as infliximab or ciclosporin) or by surgical colectomy.
