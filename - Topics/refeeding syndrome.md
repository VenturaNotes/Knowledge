- a potentially fatal condition that may affect severely malnourished patients in response to the reintroduction of a protein- and calorie-rich diet. It is thought to be due to severe fluid and electrolyte shifts (especially low phosphate, magnesium, and potassium levels in the blood) and related metabolic complications (e.g. raised levels of insulin in the blood). Clinical complications include heart failure, paraesthesia, muscle weakness, cardiac arrhythmias, fitting, and death. An assessment to identify at-risk patients before the reinstatement of feeding, regular monitoring, and prompt correction of electrolyte abnormalities helps to prevent this condition.
