- One of a series of lines marked on the hull of a ship to show the extent to which the hull may be immersed in the water. Originally introduced by Samuel Plimsoll MP in 1874 and running right round the hull, the Plimsoll Line made a great contribution to safety at sea. The modern markings consist of a series of lines, usually painted on the hull amidships, applying to different conditions. The line marked TF applies to tropical fresh water, F fresh water, T tropical sea water, S summer sea water, W winter sea water and WNA winter in the North Atlantic. Shipowners and masters who allow vessels to be overloaded face heavy penalties.
