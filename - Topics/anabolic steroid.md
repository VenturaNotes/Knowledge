## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. Any of several synthetic steroid hormones used clinically and by athletes to promote muscle tissue growth, with side-effects including mood (1) swings, hallucinations, paranoia, liver damage, and elevated blood pressure. They sometimes induce a sense of euphoria and exaggerated self-importance, but after repeated use this may give way to listlessness, irritability, and general dysphoria. Among the most common are nandrolone (injectable, slow-acting), drostanalone (taken orally, fastacting), oxymethalone (taken orally), and stanozolol (taken orally and popular with women because of its relatively low androgenic potency). Also called an anabolic androgenic steroid. See also PERFORMANCE ENHANCER, ROID RAGE, SUBSTANCE ABUSE, SUBSTANCE-RELATED AND ADDICTIVE DISORDERS. Compare STEROID. \[From Greek anabole a heaping up, from ana up + bole a throw + sterol + -oeides denoting resemblance of form, from eidos shape]
## Source[^2]
- Any steroid compound that promotes tissue growth, especially of muscles. Naturally occurring anabolic steroids include the male sex hormones (androgens). Synthetic forms of these are used medically to help weight gain after debilitating diseases; their use by athletes to build up body muscles can cause liver damage and is banned by most athletic authorities.
