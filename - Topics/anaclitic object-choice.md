- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a form of object-choice in which one chooses a love-object to resemble a parental figure, being attracted to people who have the ability to feed, care, and protect one. It is usually explained by the fact that the sexual instinct initially develops anaclitically on the instinct of self-preservation. The concept was introduced in 1914 by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) in an article 'On Narcissism: An Introduction' (Standard Edition, XIV, pp. 73-102, at pp. 87-90). See also anaclitic. Compare nARCISSISTIC OBJECT-CHOICE.
