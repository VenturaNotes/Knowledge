- $n$. a device, used in diagnostic radiology or radiotherapy, to produce a narrow beam of radiation by means of metallic sheets, acting like a diaphragm in a camera, that control the size of the beam from a radiation source. Many newer linear accelerators use multi-leaf collimators, a specialized form of collimator using individual 'leaves' ( 1 cm or smaller) to shape the radiation treatment field around the tumor. Collimators are also used on radiation detectors, in particular in gamma cameras, for which the exact source of radioactivity needs to be known to produce an accurate image.
