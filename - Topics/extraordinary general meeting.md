- (EGM) Any general meeting of a company other than the annual general meeting. Most company's articles give the directors the right to call an EGM whenever they wish. Members have the right to requisition an EGM if they hold not less than $10 \%$ of the paid-up share capital; a resigning auditor may also requisition a meeting. Directors must call an EGM when there has been a serious loss of capital. The court may call an EGM if it is impracticable to call it in any other way. Those entitled to attend must be given 14 days' notice of the meeting ( 21 days if a special resolution is to be proposed). See also AGENDA; ORDER OF BUSINESS.
