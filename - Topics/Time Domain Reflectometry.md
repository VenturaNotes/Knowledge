- Time domain reflectometry (TDR) identifies network faults such as cable breaks and loose connections. TDR determines the total length of a network cable, the location of joints in the cable, and any cable faults or interruptions. An electronic instrument called a time domain reflectometer sends a voltage pulse to the network cable and measures the time it takes for the pulse to return from any reflections. This method helps users calculate the distance to the reflection, and identify issues in the cable.
