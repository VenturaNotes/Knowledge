- The sensible management of the earth's natural resources in order to avoid degradation and impoverishment of the environment (see DESERTIFICATION). It should include the search for alternative food and fuel supplies when these are endangered (as by deforestation and overfishing); an awareness of the dangers of pollution; the maintenance of biodiversity; and the protection of natural habitats together with the creation of new ones (e.g. nature reserves, national parks, and SSSIs) to compensate for losses elsewhere. See also sustainable.
