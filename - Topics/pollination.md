- The transfer of pollen from an anther (the male reproductive organ) to a stigma (the receptive part of the female reproductive organ), either of the same flower (selfpollination) or of a different flower of the same species (cross-pollination). Crosspollination involves the action of a pollinating agent to effect transfer of the pollen (see ANEMOPHILY; ENTOMOPHILY; HYDROPHILY). Transfer of pollen is followed by germination of the pollen grain and growth of a pollen tube through the style to deliver the male gametes to the ovule. See also FERTILIZATION; INCOMPATIBILITY.
