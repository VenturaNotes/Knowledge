- The bending or spreading of waves as they pass around an obstacle, resulting in interference. If the wavelengths of the waves being diffracted are roughly the same as the distances between atoms in a molecule or solid, then information can be obtained about that molecule or solid. Important examples of diffraction in chemistry are electron diffraction, LEED, neutron diffraction, and X-ray diffraction.
