- (fusion imaging) n. (in diagnostic imaging) the process of taking two images obtained by different techniques and (usually electronically) laying them on top of each other after suitable adjustment, so that the anatomical landmarks coincide. This can give more accurate information as one technique shows the anatomy and the other shows the pathology. Co-registering can thus show which part of the body is involved in the disease process. It is typically used in PET/CT scanning. CT or MRI scans can also be fused onto real time ultrasound images to target a lesion for biopsy or treatment.
