## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Repeated duplication of the entire complement of genes within a single nucleus. It occurs in many actively metabolizing plant tissues, where it is evidenced by enlargement of the cell nuclei. The resultant multiplication of genes increases the amounts of messenger RNAs available to the cell, and hence permits the synthesis of large quantities of proteins. Compare GENE AMPLIFICATION.
