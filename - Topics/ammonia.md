- A colorless gas, $\mathrm{NH}_{3}$, with a strong pungent odor. Ammonia is produced by the deamination of excess amino acids in the liver. Industrially it is made from its constituent elements by the Haber process for use in the manufacture of nitric acid, ammonium nitrate, ammonium phosphate, and urea (the last three as fertilizers), explosives, dyestuffs, and resins. The participation of ammonia in the nitrogen cycle is a most important natural process. By means of nitrogenase enzymes, nitrogen-fixing bacteria are able to achieve similar reactions to those of the Haber process, but under normal conditions of temperature and pressure. The reactions release ammonium ions, which are converted by nitrifying bacteria into nitrite and nitrate ions.
