- Also known as the Cauchy-Frobenius lemma and, incorrectly, as Burnside's lemma. For a group action of a finite group G on a finite set S, the number of orbits equals $$\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\upvarepsilon G}\text{fix}(g),$$where fix(g) is the number of elements s $\in$ S fixed by $g$, that is $g.s =s$. The formula is useful in combinatorics
