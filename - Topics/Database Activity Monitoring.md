- Database activity monitoring (DAM) is a suite of tools that monitor a database's activities including identifying fraudulent, illegal, or undesirable behavior within a database (such as inappropriate access to classified information). These tools have advanced capabilities such as vulnerability management, discovery and classification, and application-level analysis. Businesses can also use DAM tools to support unstructured data security, identity and access management, risk management, and intrusion prevention.Â DAM tools monitor database activities with minimal impact on user operations or productivity.
