- (1) A limit on the import or export of a particular product imposed by a government. Import quotas may be imposed for protectionist reasons (i.e. to shield domestic manufacturers from foreign competition); export quotas may be imposed in countries that depend on the export of a particular raw material, as a means of stabilizing prices. Quotas are usually controlled by the issue of licences. 
- (2) Any proportional share of a whole allocated to a particular person, organization, or country.
