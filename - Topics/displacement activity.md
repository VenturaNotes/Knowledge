- An activity shown by an animal that appears to be inappropriate to its situation. Displacement activities are frequently observed when there is conflict between opposing drives or the animal is thwarted in obtaining a goal. For example, birds in aggressive situations, in which there are simultaneous drives to attack and to flee, may preen their feathers as a displacement activity; the situation has caused disinhibition of the preening activity, allowing it to take place. Preening and feeding are common displacement activities.

- $n$. In ethology, the substitution of an irrelevant pattern of behavior for behavior that is appropriate to a particular situation, especially as a reaction to a conflict of motives. Male stickleback fish stand on their heads and dig into the sand as if building a nest when the impulses of attack and retreat are evenly balanced; fighting roosters often peck at the ground between bouts as though feeding; and humans often scratch their heads or perform self-grooming gestures (1) when in a state of conflict, embarrassment, or stress. Also called displacement behavior. See also ADAPTOR.
