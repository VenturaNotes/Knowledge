- An activity shown by an animal that appears to be inappropriate to its situation. Displacement activities are frequently observed when there is conflict between opposing drives or the animal is thwarted in obtaining a goal. For example, birds in aggressive situations, in which there are simultaneous drives to attack and to flee, may preen their feathers as a displacement activity; the situation has caused disinhibition of the preening activity, allowing it to take place. Preening and feeding are common displacement activities.
