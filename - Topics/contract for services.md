- A contract undertaken by a self-employed individual. The distinction between a contract for services (self-employed) and a contract of employment (employee) is fundamental, not least in establishing the tax position. In practice, however, the distinction may not always be clear (see WORKER). With a contract for services the person may hire and pay others to carry out the work, will be responsible for correcting unsatisfactory work at their own expense, and may make losses as well as profits.
