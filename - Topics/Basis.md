- Given the set of vectors $\{\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}-2 \\ 1 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 3 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}\}$ and $\mathbb{R}^3$
	- The set of vectors would be a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$ if any vector from $\mathbb{R^3}$ can be written as a [[linear combination]] of the 3 vectors 

## Source[^2]
- (bases) A set $S$ of vectors is a spanning set if any vector can be written as a linear combination of elements in $S$. If, in addition, the vectors in $S$ are linearly independent, then $S$ is a basis, and any element of $S$ may be referred to as a basis vector. Any vector can be written uniquely as a linear combination of the basis vectors. In 3-dimensional space, any set of three non-coplanar vectors is a basis. In 2-dimensional space, any set of 2 non-parallel vectors is a basis.
- More generally, a vector space $V$ over a field $F$ is finite-dimensional if it has a finite basis; all bases then contain the same number of vectors$\textemdash$the dimension of $V$. The introduction of a basis identifies $V$ with $F^{\operatorname{dim}V}$ and uniquely assigns coordinates to each vector. Any linearly independent set can be extended to a basis, and any spanning set contains a basis. Assuming the axiom of choice, any vector can be shown to have a basis. Compare complete orthonormal basis, dual basis, Hamel basis, orthonormal BASIS, SCHAUDER BASIS.

### Of a Topology
- Given a topology on a set $X$, a basis for the topology is a collection of subsets of $X$ such that every open set can be written as a union of sets in the basis. In a metric space the open balls form a basis. See also PRODUCT SPACE.
