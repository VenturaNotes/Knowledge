- $n$. abnormal bulging of the cornea or sclera (white) of the eye. Anterior staphyloma is a bulging scar in the cornea to which a part of the iris is attached. It is usually the site of a healed corneal ulcer that has penetrated right through the cornea; the iris blocks the hole and prevents the further leakage of fluid from the front chamber of the eye. In ciliary staphyloma the sclera bulges over the ciliary body as a result of high pressure inside the eyeball. A bulging of the sclera at the back of the eye (posterior staphyloma) occurs in some severe cases of short-sightedness.
