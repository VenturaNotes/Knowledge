## Source [^1]
- $n$. a method of asexual reproduction in which the body of a protozoan or bacterium splits into two equal parts (binary fission), as in the amoebae, or more than two equal parts (multiple fission), for example sporozoite formation in the malarial parasite (see Plasmodium). The resulting products of fission eventually grow into complete organisms.
## Source[^2]
- A type of asexual reproduction occurring in some unicellular organisms, e.g. diatoms, protozoans, and bacteria, in which the parent cell divides to form two (binary fission) or more (multiple fission) similar daughter cells.
## Source[^3]
- n. 
- (1) The process of splitting something into parts. 
- (2) A form of asexual reproduction in which a single-celled organism such as a bacterium divides into two or more equal parts, each of which then develops into a new cell. \[From Latin fissio a cleaving + -ion indicating an action, process, or state]
