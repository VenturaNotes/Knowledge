- $n$. a method of asexual reproduction in which the body of a protozoan or bacterium splits into two equal parts (binary fission), as in the amoebae, or more than two equal parts (multiple fission), for example sporozoite formation in the malarial parasite (see Plasmodium). The resulting products of fission eventually grow into complete organisms.
