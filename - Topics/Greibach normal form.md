- A restricted type of context-free grammar, namely one in which all productions have the form

  

$$

A \rightarrow b C_{1} \ldots C_{n}

$$

  

i.e. each right-hand side consists of a terminal followed by (zero or more) nonterminals. Any context-free language is generated by such a grammar, except that derivation of the empty string, $\Lambda$, requires the additional production

  

$$

S \rightarrow \mathrm{~A}

$$

  

One significance of this form is that it makes clear the existence of an equivalent pushdown automaton: on reading $b$ the PDA can pop $A$ from the stack and push $C_{1} \ldots C_{n}$.
