- A firm that specializes in selling goods direct to customers by post. Orders are obtained from an illustrated catalogue supplied by the firm or by agents, who introduce the catalogue. The low costs of selling, especially the absence of retail premises, enable the mail-order houses to offer goods at competitive prices. See also DIRECT-MAIL SELLING.
