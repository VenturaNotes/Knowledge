- (Ringer's mixture) a clear colorless physiological solution of sodium chloride (common salt), potassium chloride, and calcium chloride prepared with recently boiled pure water. The osmotic pressure of the solution is the same as that of blood serum. Ringer's solution is used for maintaining organs or tissues alive outside the animal or human body for limited periods. Sterile Ringer's solution may be injected intravenously to treat dehydration. \[S. Ringer (1835-1910), British physiologist]
