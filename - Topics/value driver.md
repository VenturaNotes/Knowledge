- Any variable that significantly affects the value of an organization. In his development of shareholder value analysis, Alfred Rappaport identified seven key drivers of value:
	- sales growth rate
	- operating profit margin
	- tax rate
	- fixed capital investment
	- working capital investment
	- planning period
	- cost of capital.
- Of these, the first five can be used to forecast the future cash flows of a business, whereas the remaining two can be used to calculate the present value of these cash flows.
- In practice, different companies will have different value drivers. For example, Sony is a company that produces high-quality products for which customers are prepared to pay a relatively high price. Maintaining a high operating profit margin is therefore more important for Sony than sales growth. For another company, however, sales growth may well be the more important factor.
