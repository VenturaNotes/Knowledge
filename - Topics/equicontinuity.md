- A family of functions $f_i: X \to Y$ between metric spaces are equicontinuous at x in $X$ if for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\delta > 0$ such that whenever $d_X(x,y) < \delta$, then $d_Y(f_i(x), f_i(y)) < \varepsilon$ for all $i$.
- The family is uniformly equicontinuous if for any $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists $\varepsilon > 0$ such that whenever $d_X(x,y) < \delta$, then $d_Y(f_i(x), f_i(y)) < \varepsilon$ for all $i$ and all $x,y$.
