- $n$. 
- (1) (induced abortion, termination of pregnancy) the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus at a stage of pregnancy when it is deemed incapable of independent survival (i.e. at any time between conception and the 24th week of pregnancy). One of the most commonly performed gynaecological procedures in the UK, it must be carried out within the terms of the Abortion Act 1967, as amended by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990. Two doctors must agree that termination of pregnancy is necessary, either (a) under 24 weeks, if continuing the pregnancy poses a greater risk to the physical or mental health of the woman or her existing children, or (b) over 24 weeks, if the woman's life or health is seriously in danger or if there is a substantial risk of severe disability in the child if born. The woman must be provided with full information about the methods of termination available so that she can give informed consent. Over 90\% of terminations in the UK are performed under 24 weeks, and most of these under 12 weeks. Early medical termination (using drugs, e.g. mifepristone, misoprostol) carries less risk to the woman than later surgical termination (e.g. vacuum aspiration, dilatation and curettage). The 1967 Act was never applied to Northern Ireland, where the law remained far more restrictive; measures to decriminalize abortion in the province took effect in October 2019.
