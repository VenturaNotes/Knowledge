- Random sampling is a method of randomly selecting a sample from a large population, with each sample having an equal chance of being selected. This type of sampling is used when it is not possible or practical to obtain a complete list of all members of a population. For instance, if you want to select a random sample of people to survey opinions on a new product, you can use random sampling.
