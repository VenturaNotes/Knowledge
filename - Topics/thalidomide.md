- $n$. a drug that was formerly used as a sedative. If taken during the first three months of pregnancy, it was found to cause fetal abnormalities involving limb malformation and was withdrawn as a sedative in 1962. Recently, however, thalidomide has been found to be effective in treating myeloma and severe reactions in leprosy. It appears to act in various ways, including as an immunomodulator, anti-inflammatory agent, and angiogenesis inhibitor. Side-effects include constipation, drowsiness, and (with long-term use) peripheral neuropathy. It should not be used in women who are pregnant or capable of becoming pregnant.
