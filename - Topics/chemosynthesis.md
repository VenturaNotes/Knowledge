## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A type of autotrophic nutrition in which organisms (called chemoautotrophs) synthesize organic materials using energy derived from the oxidation of inorganic chemicals, rather than from sunlight. Chemoautotrophs are exclusively archaea or bacteria, including Nitrosomonas, which oxidizes ammonium to nitrite; and Thiobacillus, which oxidizes sulphur to sulphate.
