- (TBL) A method of measuring a company's social and environmental impact in addition to its economic value. Triple bottom-line accounting seeks to appraise not only (i) the conventional 'bottom line' of economic profit and loss, but also (ii) a company's 'people account', a measure of corporate social responsibility, and (iii) its 'planet account', a gauge of its environmental impact. The concept was introduced by John Elkington in 1994.
