- (of degree $n$ ). A generalization of a binary search tree to a tree of degree $n$ where each node in the ordered tree has $m \leq n$ children and contains ( $m-1$ ) ordered key values, called subkeys. for some given search key, if the key is less than the first subkey then the first subtree (if it exists) is searched for the key; if the key lies between the $i$ th and $(i+1)$th subkey, where$$i=1,2, \ldots, m-2$$then the $(i+1)$th subtree (if it exists) is searched; if the key is greater than the last subkey then the $m$th subtree (if it exists) is searched. See also B-TREE.
