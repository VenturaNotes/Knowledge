- (EVAR) a recently developed technique that involves the insertion of a covered metal stent into an aneurysm. The stent lines the aneurysm and thereby excludes it from the circulation, preventing further expansion and rupture. The delivery system containing the stents is introduced through the common femoral artery. Fluoroscopy provides real-time imaging to guide placement of the stents and ensure they are in the correct anatomical position.
