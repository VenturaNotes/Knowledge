- Tensors may be considered as generalizations of vectors and matrices. A type $(p,q)$ tensor T on a real vector space $V$ is a multilinear map$$T: (V^*)^p \times V^q \to \mathbb{R}$$where $V^*$ denotes the dual space. The order of the tensor $p + q$, and the tensor may also be considered as a $(p+q)$-dimensional array once bases are chosen. If $p=0$, the tensor is called covariant, and if $q=0$, the tensor is called contravariant. If $V=\mathbb{R}^n$, then the tensor is called Cartesian.
- Let $e_1, \ldots,e_n$ be a basis of $V$ and $f_1, \ldots,f_n$ be the dual basis. When $p=0$, $q=1$, $T$ is a functional, and when $p=1$, $q=0$, $T$ is a vector $v=(Tf_1,\ldots,Tf_n)$. When $p=q=1$, then $T$ represents a linear map $T:V \to V$ as follows: $T$ is represented by the matrix $(a_{ij})$, where $$T((f_i,e_j))=f_i(Te_j)=f_i(\sum_{k=1}^na_{kj}e_k)=a_{ij}.$$More properly, considered as a tensor, these entries should be written $a^{i}_j$ to denote that one of these indices is covariant, one contravariant. See also Einstein's notation.
- Tensors appear widely throughout mathematics and physics; grad is a (0,1) tensor, an inner product is a (0,2) tensor, as is the first fundamental form, the vector product is a (1, 2) tensor, stress and strain are tensors, and differential forms are tensors. The first fundamental form on a surface instead might be considered as assigning an inner product, a tensor, to each tangent space; this is an example o fa tensor field, important in physics and general relativity particularly.
