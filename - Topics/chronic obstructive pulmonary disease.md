- (COPD, chronic obstructive airways disease) a disease of adults, especially those over the age of 45 with a history of smoking or inhalation of airborne pollution, characterized by airflow obstruction that is not fully reversible. The disease has features of emphysema, chronic bronchitis, and asthmatic bronchitis. It is now diagnosed, according to the GOLD guidelines, at different stages:
	- Stage 0: the presence of risk factors and symptoms (e.g. cough and wheeze) with normal forced expiratory volume in 1 second $\left(\mathrm{FEV}_{1}\right)$.
	- Stage 1: $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ is normal, but the ratio of $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ to forced vital capacity (FVC) is less than $70 \%$.
	- Stage 2: $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ is less than $80 \%$ but more than $50 \%$ of the predicted value for the patient's age and height.
	- Stage 3: $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ less than $50 \%$ but more than $30 \%$.
	- Stage 4: $\mathrm{FEV}_{1}$ less than $30 \%$ or the presence of chronic respiratory failure.
- The guidelines for COPD recommend different treatment regimens for different stages. Although the response to inhaled corticosteriods is less for COPD than for asthma, these drugs, especially combined with inhaled long-acting beta agonists (e.g. salmeterol), can improve quality of life and survival in stages 3 and 4 . There is also a decrease in the number of acute exacerbations of COPD (AECOPD): increased sputum volume or purulence and/or breathlessness, with or without symptoms (e.g. cough, wheeze, chest pain, malaise, fever).
