- generalized inflammation of the glomeruli of the kidneys resulting in a reduction in glomerular filtration rate, with mild oedema and hypertension resulting from renal salt and water retention. Urine analysis shows the presence of proteinuria and microscopic haematuria with red cell casts. Common and usually self-limiting causes are Berger's nephropathy and poststreptococcal glomerulonephritis. Less common but more serious causes of the nephritic syndrome are the vasculitides (see VASCULITIS) and Goodpasture's disease, which, untreated, usually prove fatal.
