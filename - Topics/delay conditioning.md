- $n$. A type of conditioning (1) in which the conditioned stimulus is presented repeatedly for longer and longer periods of time until there is eventually a very long delay between the onset of the conditioned stimulus and the occurrence of the unconditioned stimulus. The Russian physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849-1936) found that animals were not only able to bridge this gap in time but were ultimately able to delay the occurrence of the conditioned response until it just preceded the arrival of the unconditioned stimulus. Compare TRAce CONDITIONING.
