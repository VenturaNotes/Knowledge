- the appearance, on ultrasonography of a pregnant woman, of a feature suggesting an abnormality in the fetus. Such markers can be classified as major fetal structural abnormalities or minor ultrasound features called soft markers. The latter are usually transient and may resolve spontaneously, but they may indicate the risk of a serious chromosomal abnormality in the fetus. An example is increased nuchal translucency (see NUCHAL TRANSLUCENCY SCANNING).
