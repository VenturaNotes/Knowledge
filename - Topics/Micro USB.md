- A micro universal serial bus (USB) is a miniature version of a USB that was developed by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF). Micro USBs enable the transfer of power or data between devices. Micro USBs are nearly half the size of regular USB cables, designed to plug into small computerized devices such as smartphones, tablets, and other forms of mobile electronic devices.
