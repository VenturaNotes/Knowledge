- a pear-shaped sac ( $7-10 \mathrm{~cm}$ long), lying underneath the right lobe of the liver, in which bile is stored (see illustration overleaf). Bile passes (via the common hepatic duct) to the gall bladder from the liver, where it is formed, and is released into the duodenum (through the common bile duct) under the influence of the hormone cholecystokinin, which is secreted when food is present in the duodenum. The gall bladder is a common site of stone formation (see GALLSTONE).
