- a group of growth factors that promote new bone formation. Bone morphogenic protein (BMP), a naturally occurring substance that induces osteoblast formation, has been genetically synthesized to form bone morphogenetic protein, which stimulates new bone formation and assists with fracture healing. Other bone growth factors include a type of transforming growth factor (TGF$\beta$) and insulin-like growth factor II (IGF-II), which encourage collagen formation.
