- The method of calculating the net present value of a stream of payments by adding the present discounted values of all net cash flows at various future dates. Let the net receipts (income less cost) at time $t$ be $R_{t}$, and the rate of interest be $100 r$ per cent. The present discounted value of net receipts at time $t$ is $R_{t} /(1+r)^{t}$, and the discounted cash flow is the sum of these values over the entire future, given by$$F=\sum_{t=1}^{\infty} R_{t} /(1+r)^{t}$$The flow of payments may continue indefinitely, or it may be expected that for $t>t^{*}, R_{t}=0$. Some of the $R_{t}$ may be negative. For example, if the payments are obtained from an investment project, then this will be the case if construction takes time and there is a running-in period before the project is expected to make a profit. There may also be decommissioning costs at the end of the project.

- (DCF) A method used in capital budgeting, capital expenditure appraisal, and decision appraisal that predicts the future stream of cash flows, both inflows and outflows, over time and discounts them, using a cost of capital rate or hurdle rate, to present values in order to determine whether the project or decision is likely to be financially sensible. A number of appraisal approaches use the DCF principle, namely net present value, internal rate of return, and the profitability index. Most computer spreadsheet programs now include a DCF appraisal routine.
