- A form of DNA repair that replaces mismatched bases in newly replicated DNA in living cells. For example, if a guanine (G) on the template strand pairs with thymine (T) instead of the usual cytosine (C), the resulting abnormality in the DNA duplex is detected by the mismatch repair system. A length of strand containing the mismatched T is cut out and the gap is repaired with a new length containing the correct base (C), using the parental strand as template. The mismatch repair system closely follows the Yshaped fork where the parental DNA unwinds and replication takes place, so enabling immediate correction of replication errors. It accounts for the vast majority of DNA repairs.
