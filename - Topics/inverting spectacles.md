Eyeglasses incorporating prisms that have the effect of inverting the images projected on the retinas and the visual images seen by the wearer, first worn by the US psychologist George Malcolm Stratton (1865-1957) in an experiment performed in 1895 and published in the journal Psychological Review in 1897. Stratton wore the spectacles, which in that case inverted the visual field and also reversed left and right, continuously during waking hours for seven days, and towards the end of this time the world looked almost normal to him, a finding that refuted the view held by some people at the time that an inverted retinal image was necessary for perceiving the world the right way up.
