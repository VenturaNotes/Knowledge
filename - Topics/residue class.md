- (modulo n) An equivalence class for the equivalence relation of congruence modulo $n$. So, two integers are in the same class if they have the same remainder upon division by $n$. If $[a]$ denotes the residue class modulo $n$ containing $a$, the residue classes modulo $n$ can be represented as $[0], [1], [2], \ldots, [n-1].$ The sum and product of residue classes are defined by$$[a] + [b] = [a+b], [a][b] = [ab],$$where it is necessary to show these definitions are well defined and independent of the choices of representatives $a$ and $b$. With this addition and multiplication, the set, denoted by $\mathbb{Z}_n$, of residue classes modulo $n$ forms a commutative ring with identity. If $n$ is composite, the ring $\mathbb{Z}_n$ has zero-divisors, but when $p$ is prime $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is a field.
