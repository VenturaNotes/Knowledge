- a condition in which the patient has painful temporomandibular joints, tenderness in the muscles that move the jaw, clicking of the joints, and limitation of jaw movement. Stress, resulting in clenching the jaws and grinding the teeth, is often a causal factor but occlusion, trauma, and systemic factors may also need to be considered. Treatment is normally conservative.
