- A simple perspective drawing of the cyclic structure of monosaccharides devised by the English chemist Sir Norman Haworth (1883–1950) in 1929. The molecule is viewed slightly from above, with thicker lines used to represent bonds between those atoms that are closer to the viewer. This representation is not completely realistic, as the molecules represented are non-planar. The Haworth projection has been used extensively to demonstrate the structures of sugars. See also Fischer projection.
