- The gig economy refers to the practice of working short-term, freelance jobs instead of traditional, permanent jobs requiring a 40-hour workweek with set hours. Typical “gig” workers in the gig economy include delivery drivers, freelance writers, web developers, or virtual assistants. Companies often hire them to avoid paying the costs associated with full-time employees, like health insurance, vacation time, and retirement contributions.
