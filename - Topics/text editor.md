- Text editors form an essential part of the user interface of all interactive systems. They may be line-oriented, where the text is considered to be a series of lines separated by end-of-line markers, character-oriented, where the text is considered to be a stream of characters with any end-of-line or page markers counting as characters, or [[screen editor|screen editors]]. With screen editors, the display screen forms a movable window into the text, within which the cursor may be positioned at points where insertions, deletions, and other editing functions are to be performed.
- There is a considerable overlap in function between text editors and word processing systems.
