- A point of interconnection between two systems or parts of a system, e.g. that between a processor and a peripheral, at which all the physical, electrical, and logical parameters are in accordance with predetermined values and are collectively used in other instances. An interface may be classed as standard on the basis of manufacturer, industry, or international usage. When introduced in the 1970s the concept of a standard interface was a significant step forward since until then nearly every device had its own unique interface. The term is seldom used these days since virtually all interfaces used now conform to one standard or another.
