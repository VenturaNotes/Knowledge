- (1) n. a device, usually a tube or wick, used to draw fluid from an internal body cavity to the surface. A drain is sometimes inserted during an operation to ensure that any fluid formed immediately passes to the surface, so preventing an accumulation that may become infected or cause pressure in the operation site. Negative pressure (suction) can be applied through a tube drain to increase its effectiveness. Chest drains can be used in the treatment of chest trauma to drain blood (haemothorax) or air (pneumothorax) that accumulates in the pleural space.
- (2) vb. see DRAINAGE.
