- $n$. A discrimination task in which an organism learns to select from a set of stimuli the one that differs from all of the others. It was first used in psychology in an experiment carried out by the US psychologist Andrew Janeway Kinnaman (1863-1928) and reported in the American Journal of Psychology in 1902 in which food was hidden in a colored beaker and presented to macaque monkeys among four grey beakers carefully matched for brightness with the colored beaker, and the monkeys learned to choose the colored beakers quickly and easily, which established their ability to perceive colors.
