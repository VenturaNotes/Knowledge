- A proof of concept (POC) is the act of demonstrating a product, service, or solution to sell it. A proof of concept should show the buyer that the product works how it's supposed to work, while also proving that the product will help their business. Often, a proof of concept is small and may be a work in progress. POCs can be thought of as a test run for both the seller and buyer.
