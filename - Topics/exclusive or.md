## Synthesis
- A logical operator that outputs true only when its two inputs differ (one is true and the other is false).
### Examples
- 2 XOR 5
	- 2 in binary is 010
	- 5 in binary is 101
	- 010 XOR 1010 = 111 (which is 7 in decimal)
### Finding Binary XOR
- Align the binary number by their rightmost bit and compare
- Given $2 = 010_2$ and $5 = 101_2$ 
	- The third digit of each is 0 XOR 1 = 1
	- The second digit of each is 1 XOR 0 = 1
	- The first digit of each is 0 XOR 1 = 1
- So 2 XOR 5 = $111_2$
