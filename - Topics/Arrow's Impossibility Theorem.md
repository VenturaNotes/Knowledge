- The surprising result that when voters have three or more distinct options to choose from, there is no rank-order voting system which can aggregate the individual preferences of two or more individuals so that four apparently reasonable conditions are met.

- Arrow's impossibility theorem The theorem provides a proof that no perfect process exists for aggregating individual rankings of alternatives into a collective (or social) ranking. An example of an aggregation process is majority voting but the Condorcet paradox shows how this can fail to produce a useful outcome. A perfect process is defined as one that satisfies a set of desirable axioms. The basis of Arrow's theorem is a set of axioms that a collective ranking must satisfy. One of several equivalent ways of expressing these axioms is the following. 
	- Independence of irrelevant alternatives: adding a new option should not affect the initial ranking of the old options, so the collective ranking over the old options should remain unchanged. 
	- Non-dictatorship: the collective ranking should not be determined by the preferences of a single individual. 
	- Pareto criterion: if every individual agrees on the ranking of the options, so should society. Hence, the collective ranking should coincide with the common individual ranking. 
	- Unrestricted domain: the collective choice method should accommodate any possible individual ranking of options. 
	- Transitivity: if option $A$ is preferred to option $B$ and $B$ to $C$ in the social ranking then $C$ cannot be preferred to $A$. 
- The impossibility theorem proves that there is no aggregation process that simultaneously satisfies these five axioms. See also COLLECTIVE CHOICE; INTERPERSONAL COMPARISONS; VOTING.

- $n$. A theorem introduced in 1951 by the US economist Kenneth J(oseph) Arrow (born 1921) and modified in 1963 to correct an error that had been found in it, showing that no voting system or any other social choice function could ever guarantee to aggregate the individual preferences of a group into a collective preference ranking so as to satisfy the following four seemingly necessary but mild conditions of fairness. (U) Unrestricted domain: the social choice function must generate a collective preference order from any logically possible set of individual preference orders; (P) Pareto condition: whenever all individuals prefer an alternative $x$ to another $y, x$ must be preferred to $y$ in the collective preference order; (I) Independence of irrelevant alternatives: the collective preference order of any pair of alternatives $x$ and $y$ must depend solely on the individuals' preferences between these alternatives and not on their preferences for other (irrelevant) alternatives; (D) Non-dictatorship: the collective preference order must not invariably correspond to the preferences of any single individual, regardless of the preferences of the others. The proof of the theorem relies on the profile of individual preferences that gives rise to Condorcet's paradox of intransitive preferences and shows that any social choice function that satisfies $U, P$, and $I$ necessarily violates $D$ and is therefore dictatorial. Also called Arrow's paradox.
