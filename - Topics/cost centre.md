- The area of an organization for which costs are collected for the purposes of cost ascertainment, planning, decision making, and control. Cost centres are determined by individual organizations; they may be based on a function, department, section, individual, or any group of these. Cost centres are of two main types: production cost centres in an organization are those concerned with making a product, while service cost centres provide a service (such as stores, boilerhouse, or canteen) to other parts of the organization.
