- An informal term widely used in the media to describe a rapidly worsening economic situation. It draws on the analogy with the meltdown of the core of a nuclear reactor: it is self-sustaining, exceptionally dangerous, and requires extreme action to contain the consequences. Since it is an informal term no precise set of characteristics that constitute a meltdown can be listed but, if one occurs, it will be easily recognized.
