- $n$. a fungus (Claviceps purpurea) that grows on rye. It produces several important alkaloids, chemically related to LSD, including ergotamine and ergometrine, which are used in medicine in the treatment of migraine and in childbirth. Eating bread made with rye infected with the fungus has led to sporadic outbreaks of ergotism over the centuries.
## Source[^2]
- The dark hard-walled mass of hyphae produced by the fungus Claviceps purpurea (see ASCOMYCOTA) in the grain of the cereals and other grasses that it parasitizes. Ergots are the sclerotia of this species-resting bodies that germinate in favorable conditions to produce mycelia or ascocarps. They contain alkaloids related to LSD, which cause blood vessels to constrict and are used therapeutically in the treatment of migraine and haemorrhage. Ingestion of infected grain can result in ergot poisoning (ergotism), with symptoms of gangrene and hallucinations$\textemdash$known as 'St Anthony's fire' in the Middle Ages.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A fungus that grows on wheat or rye, or an alkaloid drug derived from it that induces contractions of the womb in women and is a powerful vasoconstrictor, useful in the treatment of migraine headaches and haemorrhage. \[From French ergot a cock's spur, which the fungal projections on the ears of wheat or rye resemble in shape]
