- $n$. a tube placed inside a tubular structure in the body to keep it open. It may be a simple plastic or metal tube; the former are more easily removable, while the latter give a larger lumen for a given outer diameter. Metallic stents are further divided into self-expanding stents, which open up by themselves on deployment, and balloon-expandable stents, which need to be expanded with the use of a balloon. Stents may be used at operation to aid healing of an anastomosis, for example of a ureter. Alternatively they can be placed across an obstruction to maintain an open lumen, for example in obstruction due to tumor in the oesophagus, stomach, bile ducts, colon, or ureter. In an artery after angioplasty, stents help to prevent recoiling. The stents used in coronary artery disease are balloon-expandable and nowadays are coated with drugs that inhibit growth of the scar tissue (neointimal hyperplasia) responsible for recurrent stenosis. These are known as drug-eluting stents.
