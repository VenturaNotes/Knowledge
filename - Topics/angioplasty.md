- $n$. repair or reconstruction of a narrowed or completely obstructed blood vessel. Traditionally, this was performed during open surgery, but in modern practice angioplasty commonly refers to percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA; balloon angioplasty), in which an inflatable balloon, mounted on the tip of a flexible catheter, is placed within the lumen of the affected vessel at the site of the narrowing/blockage, under X-ray control. On inflation of the balloon the lumen is reopened with varying rates of success. A vascular stent may be required if the results are suboptimal. Common sites for PTA are coronary, carotid, renal, and leg arteries. See also CORONARY ANGIOPLASTY.
