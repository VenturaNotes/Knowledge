- a chart for testing visual acuity in which the rows of letters (optotypes) vary in size in a logarithmic progression. The space between the letters in a row and the space between each row is identical to the size of the letters in that row. This neutralizes the effect of crowding on vision. There are five letters in each row and each letter has a score of 0.02 $\log$ unit (the name derives from logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution). This makes it more accurate than a Snellen chart and it is becoming increasingly used in testing vision. Most tests are done at a distance of 4 metres, allowing it to be used in smaller rooms. The acuity is scored as a number, with 1 being the same as 6/60 on the Snellen chart and 0 being equivalent to 6/6 (normal visual acuity). Vision better than 6/6 is scored as a negative, e.g. -0.18 .
