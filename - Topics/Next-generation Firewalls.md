- Next-generation Firewalls (NGFWs) refer to the second-generation of a network security system that observes network activity and filters out potential threats. While traditional firewalls offer a thorough examination of network traffic from enter and exit points, they do not offer protection against all modern-day threats. NGFWs are designed to offer more advanced options to users. By using deep-packet inspection, they are able to monitor and block threats beyond the port and protocol to also offer application-level inspection and prevention techniques. NGFWs also provide multi-layered protection against threats such as viruses, ransomware, malware, and other cybersecurity concerns.
