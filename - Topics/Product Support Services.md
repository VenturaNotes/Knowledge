- After hardware or software is sold, issues can arise. Whether an IT group has difficulties installing said product, or it suddenly requires troubleshooting, product support services are in charge of walking customers through their concerns/questions. The product support services may be a branch of the provider itself, or it may be an third-party, independent provider. In either scenario, the mission of product support services is to resolve issues to improve customer satisfaction after a sale has taken place.
