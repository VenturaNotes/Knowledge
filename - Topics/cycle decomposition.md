- Any permutation of a finite set may be written as a product of disjoint cycles. This expression is unique up to the order of the cycles, and cycling terms within cycles. For example, the permutation of {1, ..., 8} given by $1 \mapsto 7, 2 \mapsto 5, 3 \mapsto 2, 4 \mapsto 8, 5 \mapsto 3, 6 \mapsto 1, 7 \mapsto 6, 8 \mapsto 4$ can be written as $(176)(253)(48)$ or equally as $(532)(84)(761).$ The order of a permutation is the least common multiple of the length of its cycles, here $lcm(3,3,2) = 6$
