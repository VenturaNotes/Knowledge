The evolutionarily oldest part of the cerebellum, present even in fishes, consisting of a pair of small irregular structures (flocculi) joined in the middle by a node (1) or nodulus and separated by a deep fissure from the back of the cerebellum, connected to the vestibular system and concerned chiefly with posture, balance, and ballistic movements. \[From Latin flocculus a small tuft of wool, diminutive of floccus a tuft of wool + nodulus a small knot, diminutive of nodus a knot, alluding to its appearance as two small tufts of wool with a small knot in the middle]
