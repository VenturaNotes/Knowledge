- A system of local taxation in the UK. The rateable value of properties is decided by District Valuers, and is used as the basis of business rates and charges to domestic premises by water companies. The uniform business rate is charged on business premises at a level determined by central government. Domestic rates, which were paid only by households, were at levels per pound of rateable value, the rate in the pound being set by local authorities. Domestic rates were replaced in 1990 in England and Wales (1989 in Scotland) by the community charge.
