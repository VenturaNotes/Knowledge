## Source [^1]
- Software services that are made available over the Internet and executed on a remote system hosting the requested services. Web services commonly use XML and HTTP to communicate, allowing applications to interact with each other over the web.Â Selecting the right hosting solution is key to your SaaS success.
## Source[^2]
- A software component that publishes its interface on and responds to requests from a network, in particular the Internet. web services use open XML-based standards: interfaces are published using WSDL (Web Services Description Language), and services usually communicate with their clients through SOAP messages. The ambition of web services is to use the Internet to implement large-scale distributed processing in an open way.
