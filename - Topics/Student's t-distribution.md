- A continuous distribution described by the probability density function of the form$$f(x)=\frac{\Gamma((v+1) / 2)}{\sqrt{\pi v}\Gamma(v / 2)}\left[1+\frac{x^{2}}{v}\right]^{-(v+1) / 2}$$for $-\infty<x<\infty$ and $v=1,2, \ldots$ The parameter $v$ is called the number of degrees of freedom. It has mean zero for $v>1$ and variance $v /(v-2)$ for $v>$ 2. As $v$ gets large the t-distribution converges to the standard normal distribution. The square of a variable with a t-distribution with $v$ degrees of freedom has an F-distribution with $(1, v)$ degrees of freedom. Cauchy distribution is a particular case of t-distribution with $v=1$. The moment generating function for t-distribution is undefined, as there is no interval around $\mathrm{t}=0$ where it is finite.
