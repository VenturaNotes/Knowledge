- An important approach to the numerical solution of ordinary differential and integral equations. Approximations are obtained on the basis that the equation is satisfied exactly at a particular set of points in the given problem range. For example, for

  

$$

y^{\prime \prime}=f\left(x, y, y^{\prime}\right), a \leq x \leq b

$$

  

an approximation

  

$$

P(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{p} \alpha_{i} \phi_{i}(x)

$$

  

can be obtained from a suitable set of orthogonal functions $\phi_{i}(x)$ by choosing the coefficients $\alpha_{i}$ for which

  

$$

P^{\prime \prime}\left(x_{i}\right)=f\left(x_{i}, P\left(x_{i}\right), P^{\prime}\left(x_{i}\right)\right)

$$

  

for some set of collocation points

  

$$

a \leq x_{1}<x_{2}<\ldots<x_{n} \leq b

$$

  

Initial conditions and boundary conditions may also be incorporated into the process.
