- A measure used in evaluating the performance of employees, often as part of a formal performance appraisal. BOS involves a process of identifying the key tasks of a particular job and evaluating how frequently employees exhibit the required behaviour for effective performance. The scores for each of these observed behaviours can then be totalled to produce an overall performance measure. Compare BEHAVIOURALLY ANCHORED RATING SCALES; MIXED-STANDARD SCALE.
