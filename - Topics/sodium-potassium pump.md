- $\left(\mathbf{N a}^{+} / \mathbf{K}^{+}\right.$ATPase) A membrane transport protein that exchanges sodium ions $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$for potassium ions $\left(\mathrm{K}^{+}\right)$across the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell. It exports three $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$ions for every two $\mathrm{K}^{+}$ions imported. This maintains the differential concentrations of each ion across the plasma membrane so that the cell normally has a low $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$and a high $\mathrm{K}^{+}$concentration relative to the extracellular fluid. This differential is vital to cellular function, e.g. in establishing the resting potential of a neuron. The process requires energy in the form of ATP, being a form of active transport.
