- adj. having the effect of stimulating the sympathetic nervous system. The actions of sympathomimetic drugs are adrenergic: they act on alpha or beta adrenoceptors. Alpha-adrenergic stimulants (alpha agonists) stimulate alpha receptors. They include vasoconstrictors (e.g. ephedrine, phenylephrine, metaraminol), used to treat nasal congestion and severe hypotension, and the selective $\alpha_{2}$ agonists apraclonidine and brimonidine, which are used in the treatment of glaucoma. Beta-adrenergic stimulants (beta agonists) stimulate $\beta_{1}$ and/or $\beta_{2}$ adrenoceptors. $\beta_{2}$ agonists such as salbutamol, salmeterol, and terbutaline relax bronchial smooth muscle and are used as bronchodilators. Some $\beta_{2}$ agonists, including salbutamol, relax uterine muscle and are sometimes used in the treatment of premature labor (see TOCOLYTIC). $\beta_{1}$ agonists (e.g. dobutamine) stimulate $\beta_{1}$ receptors in the heart and are therefore used for their inotropic effects.
