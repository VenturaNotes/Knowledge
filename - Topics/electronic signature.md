- An item of data incorporated into or associated with an electronically transmitted document or contract that fulfils the function of a written signature. Under the Electronic Communications Act 2000 electronic signatures are recognized in legal proceedings and as having legal effect. They can be purchased from such bodies as the Post Office and the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry on production of relevant identification documents. There is a distinction between an electronic signature in this legal sense and a digital signature, which may be simply an authentication code to verify the source of a document.
