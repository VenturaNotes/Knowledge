## Synthesis

- $n$. a particle in the cytoplasm of cells that contains enzymes responsible for breaking down substances in the cell and is bounded by a single membrane. Lysosomes are especially abundant in liver and kidney cells. Foreign particles (e.g. bacteria) taken into the cell are broken down by the enzymes of the lysosomes. When the cell dies, these enzymes are released to break down the cell's components.

- A membrane-bound sac (organelle) found in animal cells and in single-celled eukaryotes. It contains hydrolytic enzymes that degrade aged or defective cell components or material taken in by the cell from its environment, such as food particles or bacteria. The lysosomal enzymes are adapted to work in the acid conditions of the lysosome interior, which has a pH of about 4.8. This means that should the enzymes escape from the lysosome they are inactivated by the neutral pH of the cell cytosol, and so will not attack the cell contents. Primary lysosomes originate from the Golgi apparatus; they fuse with phagosomes (see PHAGOCYTOSIS) containing material for disposal, forming a secondary lysosome in which digestion takes place. In plant cells, the vacuole contains hydrolytic enzymes equivalent to those in the lysosome and can degrade materials in a manner similar to a lysosome.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any of the tiny particles containing digestive enzymes that are present in the cytoplasm of most cells, contained within membranes to prevent self-digestion of the cells. See also retrograde transport. \[From Greek lysis loosening + soma a body]
