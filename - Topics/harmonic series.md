- A series $a1 + a2 + a3 + ....$ in which $a_1, a_2, a_3, ...$ is a harmonic sequence. Often the term refers to the particular series $1 + \frac 12 + \frac 13 + \frac 14 ...$, where the `n-th` term $a_n$ equals $\frac 1n.$ For this series, $a_n \to 0$. However, the series does not have a sum to infinity since, if $s_n$ is the sum of the first $n$ terms, then $s_n \to \infty$. For large values of $n$, $s_n$ $\approx$ ln$n$ + $\upgamma$, where $\upgamma$ is Euler's constant.
