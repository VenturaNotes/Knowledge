- a collection of vesicles and folded membranes in a cell, usually connected to the endoplasmic reticulum. It stores and later transports the proteins manufactured in the endoplasmic reticulum. The Golgi apparatus is well developed in cells that produce secretions, e.g. pancreatic cells producing digestive enzymes. \[C. Golgi (1844-1926), Italian histologist]

- (Golgi complex) An assembly of vesicles and folded membranes within the cytoplasm of eukaryotic cells that forms part of the endomembrane system. It modifies proteins and packages them and other materials (e.g. polysaccharides) for delivery to the plasma membrane for secretion or to destinations within the cell. Proteins arrive in vesicles following their assembly in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), are processed within a membranous compartment, or cisterna, and ultimately sorted into Golgi vesicles for secretion, storage, or transport to lysosomes. As it 'matures' each cisterna gradually moves through the stack. The region of the stack nearest to the ER is called the cis Golgi, the middle zone is the medial Golgi, and the area where Golgi vesicles are released is the trans Golgi. Plant cells usually contain smaller arrays of Golgi-type vesicles, called dictyosomes. Some macromolecules are manufactured in the Golgi, such as certain noncellulose polysaccharides in plant cells. The apparatus is named after its discoverer, Camillo Golgi.

- $n$. A complex of easily stained stacks, called Golgi bodies or dictyosomes, of flattened membrane sacs, called Golgi vesicles, in the cytoplasm of most cells, involved in transport of lipids and proteins. Also called a Golgi complex. GA abbrev. \[Named after the Italian cytologist Camillo Golgi (1843-1926) who discovered it in 1897, although the term was first used in the scientific literature in 1913]
