- A theorem which guarantees the existence of a local inverse of a real function, which generalizes to multivariable functions. If the real continuously differentiable function $f$ has non-zero derivative of $a$, then $f$ has a continuously differentiable inverse in a neighborhood of $a$ which satisfies: $$(f^{-1})'(b) = \frac{1}{f'(a)}$$where $f(a) = b$. Similarly, the multivariate version states that if $F:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^n$ is continuously differentiable and has invertible differentiable $dF_p$ at a point $\bf p$, then F has a continuously differentiable inverse in a neighborhood of $\bf p$ satisfying $$d(F^{-1})_q = (dF_p)^{-1},$$where $\textbf q = F(\textbf p)$.
- The following result relating to continuous real functions might also be referred to as the inverse function theorem. If $f:[a,b] \to [c,d]$ is continuous, strictly increasing, and satisfies $f(a) = c,f(b) = d$, then $f$ has a strictly increasing continuous inverse.
