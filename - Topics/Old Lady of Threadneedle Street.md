- An affectionate name for the Bank of England, coined by the English politician and dramatist R B Sheridan (1751-1816). The street in which the Bank stands (since 1734 in a Renaissance building by George Sampson) probably takes its name from the thread and needle used by the Merchant Taylors, a guild whose hall is in the same street.
