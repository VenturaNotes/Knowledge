- A digital customer is a customer that makes a purchase (product or service) online. Digital purchases can be made via websites, mobile apps, or social media (brand pages or paid advertising). Digital customers can also include existing subscribers or any individual that engages with a brand digitally without making a purchase. For example, someone who regularly shares content from a brand has a positive impact without spending any money.
