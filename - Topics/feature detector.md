A neuron that responds selectively to a specific feature (1) of its input, such as an edge detector, a bar detector, or a cell specified for facial recognition in the visual association cortex (see visual CORTEX). Feature detectors in the retina were first proposed by the US neuroscientist Jerry (Jerome Ysroael) Lettvin (1920-2011) and three co-authors in an article in the Proceedings of the Institute of Radio Engineers in 1959 entitled 'What the Frog's Eye Tells the Frog's Brain'.
