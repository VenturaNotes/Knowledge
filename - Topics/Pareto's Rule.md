- (80/20 rule) A rule originally applied by the economist Vilfredo Pareto (1848-1923) to income distribution, i.e. $80 \%$ of a nation's income is earned by $20 \%$ of the population. It can be widely extended as a rule of thumb; for example: $80 \%$ of value is locked up in $20 \%$ of inventory; $80 \%$ of car breakdowns can be fixed by $20 \%$ of the spare parts range; $80 \%$ of a company's profits will come from $20 \%$ of its product range; and $80 \%$ of system failures will be caused by $20 \%$ of possible causes. The rule can be used as a guide to managers: in deciding how to spend limited funds, priority should be given to the most significant $20 \%$ of problems. Once they are eliminated the 80/20 rule will again apply to the remainder. See Pareto CHART. See also LONG TAIL.
