- A meeting of the voting shareholders of a company, or the members of an association, at which the officers report on the previous year’s activities, and accounts are submitted for approval. AGMs normally elect the chief officers and directors of companies, and the chief officers and committee members of associations. In the UK, company AGMs appoint the company’s auditors. Companies are required by law to hold AGMs, and associations are usually required to do so by their constitutions.
