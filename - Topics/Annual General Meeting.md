- A meeting of the voting shareholders of a company, or the members of an association, at which the officers report on the previous year’s activities, and accounts are submitted for approval. AGMs normally elect the chief officers and directors of companies, and the chief officers and committee members of associations. In the UK, company AGMs appoint the company’s auditors. Companies are required by law to hold AGMs, and associations are usually required to do so by their constitutions.
## Source[^2]
- An annual meeting of the shareholders of a company, which must be held every year; the meetings may not be more than 15 months apart. Shareholders must be given 14 days' notice of the meeting. The usual business transacted at an AGM is the presentation of the audited accounts, the appointment of directors and auditors and the fixing of their remuneration, and recommendations for the payment of dividends. Other business may be transacted if notice of it has been given to the shareholders. See also AGENDA; ORDER OF BUSINESS.
