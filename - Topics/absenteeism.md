- Absence from work for which there is no legitimate reason; it is often self-certified sick leave lasting for one day at a time. Most prevalent in large organizations, it can be a major problem. In order to combat it some organizations have introduced flexible working hours, increased annual leave, introduced personal days leave in addition to normal holiday entitlement, and devised incentive schemes for full attendance. High rates of absenteeism can be linked to low levels of job satisfaction and an absence culture in the workplace.
