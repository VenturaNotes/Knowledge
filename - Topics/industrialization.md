- The process of moving resources into the industrial sector. This is common in the early stages of economic development, when resources move out of primary production. Industrialization was the norm in the now advanced countries earlier in their development, and was energetically pursued by many less developed countries and by the former planned economies of the former Soviet Union and Central and Eastern Europe. In recent years most of the advanced economies have seen deindustrialization; this is not really the reverse of industrialization, as it mainly involves a shift of resources from producing goods into service sectors.
