- $n$. the process of gaseous exchange between an organism and its environment. This includes both external respiration, which involves breathing, in which oxygen is taken up by the capillaries of the lung alveoli and carbon dioxide is released from the blood, and internal respiration, during which oxygen is released to the tissues and carbon dioxide absorbed by the blood. Blood provides the transport medium for the gases between the lungs and tissue cells. In addition, it contains a pigment, haemoglobin, with special affinity for oxygen. Once inside the cell oxygen is utilized in metabolic processes resulting in the production of energy (see ATP), water, and waste materials (including carbon dioxide). See also LUNG. $\textemdash$respiratory adj.
