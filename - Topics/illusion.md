- $n$. a false perception due to misinterpretation of the stimuli arising from an object. For example, a patient may misinterpret a curtain cord as a snake. Illusions can occur in normal people, but they are usually spontaneously corrected. They may also occur in almost any psychiatric syndrome. Compare HALLUCINATION.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. According to a narrow definition, a misperception or misconception of a stimulus object, image, event, experience, or problem, or a stimulus that generates such a misperception or misconception; more generally, any misleading, deceptive, or puzzling stimulus or the experience that it generates. Perceptual illusions can arise through any sensory modality, but the most prominent are the auditory illusions, tactile illusions, and above all visual illusions. Illusions of conception rather than of perception are called cognitive illusions. Delusions of identification and memory such as Capgras syndrome, déjà vu, and the other paramnesias (1) are often referred to as illusions, but this is avoided in careful usage. See also postural aftereffect, SPACE-TIME Illusion. Compare DELusion, hallucination. \[From Latin illusio, illusionis deceit, from illudere to mock or make sport with, from ludere to play]
