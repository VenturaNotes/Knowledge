- (EOG) A recording of the electrical activity of smell (olfactory) receptors in the nose or other olfactory organ. Electrodes positioned in the olfactory epithelium detect the electrical activity of sensory olfactory cells as they respond to smells (odorants) in the environment. The electrical signals are relayed to an apparatus (electroolfactograph) that amplifies them and displays them on an oscillosope.
