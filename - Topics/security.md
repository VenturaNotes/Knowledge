	- Authentication. Are parties to a transaction who they claim to be? This is achieved by using digital signatures.
	- Privacy and confidentiality. Is transaction data protected? The consumer may want an anonymous purchase. Are all non-essential traces of a transaction removed from the public network and have all intermediary records been eliminated?
	- Integrity. Are the messages sent complete? Checks are needed to ensure that messages have not been corrupted.
	- Non-repudiability. Could the sender deny sending the message? It is essential measures are in place to protect against repudiation.
