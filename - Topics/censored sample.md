## Source [^1]
- A sample in which observations on the dependent variable are missing or reported as a single value for a known set of values of independent variables. For example, if the demand for concert tickets in a certain concert hall is measured by the number of tickets sold, the true demand is not observed whenever some concert is sold out: in all such cases the same total number of tickets sold is reported. See also TOBIT MODEL.
