- $n$. a psychiatric disorder of childhood, with an onset before the age of $2 \frac 12$ years. It is marked by severe difficulties in communicating and forming relationships with other people, in developing language, and in using abstract concepts; repetitive and limited patterns of behavior (see STEREOTYPY); and obsessive resistance to tiny changes in familiar surroundings. Autistic children find it hard to understand how other people feel, and so tend to remain isolated even into adult life. About 50\% have learning disabilities, but some may be gifted in specific areas. The cause is unknown, but genetic factors and brain damage may be important. The condition usually progresses into adulthood, and independent living is uncommon. Treatment is not specific, but lengthy specialized education is usually necessary. Behavior problems and anxiety can be controlled with behavior therapy and drugs (such as antipsychotics). Autism and similar developmental disorders, including Asperger's syndrome and Rett's syndrome, are known as autistic spectrum disorders. $\textemdash$autistic adj.
