- The basic differentiation rules
	- [[Sum rule]]
		- $\frac {d}{dx} [f(x) + g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx}f(x) + \frac{d}{dx}g(x)$
		- The derivative of a sum of functions is the sum of their derivatives
	- [[Difference rule]]
		- $\frac {d}{dx} [f(x) - g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx}f(x) - \frac{d}{dx}g(x)$
		- The derivative of a difference of functions is the difference of their derivatives
	- [[Constant multiple rule]]
		- $\frac{d}{dx}[k*f(x)] = k*\frac{d}{dx}f(x)$
		- The derivative of a constant multiplied by a function is the constant multiplied by the derivative of the function
	- [[Constant rule]]
		- $\frac{d}{dx}k = 0$
		- The derivative of any constant is always zero
