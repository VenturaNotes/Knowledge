- Inhibition of the growth of lateral buds in a plant by the presence of a growing apical bud. It is brought about by a combination of the demand for sugar by the growing bud and the actions of certain plant hormones. While the apical bud is growing, it has a strong demand for sugars, which are thus denied to lateral buds lower down the stem, thereby maintaining their state of dormancy. Moreover, polar flow of the plant hormone auxin from the shoot tip downwards inhibits the growth of new side shoots. It also triggers the synthesis of strigolactones, which directly repress bud growth. These effects are antagonized by cytokinins transported into the stem from the root. Removal of the apical bud allows sugar to be redistributed to nearby lateral buds, which are disinhibited and start to grow, assisted by the decline in the polar flow of auxin and synthesis of strigolactones.
