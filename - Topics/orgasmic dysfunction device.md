- $n$. An electrical spinal cord stimulator used to induce orgasm in women with orgasmic dysfunctions. In 1998, the US anaesthesiologist T. Stuart Meloy (born 1958) stumbled on a mid-spinal area associated with orgasmic response while implanting electrodes under local anaesthetic in the spine of a female patient to relieve chronic back pain. When he placed the electrodes in a particular position, she exclaimed: 'You're going to have to teach my husband how to do that.' Also (facetiously) called an orgasmatron.
