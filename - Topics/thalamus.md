## Synthesis

## Source[^1]
- Located above the brainstem and below the cerebral cortex.
- serves as a relay station for processing and transmitting olfactory information to higher brain regions.
- acts as a **relay station** for most sensory information traveling to the cerebral cortex
- Memory systems
	- Base of forebrain
	- Relays sensory information, a communication hub and modulates arousal and attention which influence how we encode and consolidate new information into memories  
## Source[^2]
- Most often described as a relay station because a great deal of the information that proceeds to the cortex first stops in the thalamus before being sent on to its destination
## Source[^3]
- $n$. (pl. thalami) one of two egg-shaped masses of grey matter that lie deep in the cerebral hemispheres in each side of the forebrain. The thalami are relay stations for all the sensory messages that enter the brain, before they are transmitted to the cortex. All sensory pathways, except that for the sense of smell, are linked to nuclei within the thalamus, and it is here that the conscious awareness of messages as sensations $\textendash$ temperature, pain, touch, etc. $\textendash$ probably begins.
