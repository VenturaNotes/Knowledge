## Synthesis

## Source[^1]
- Located above the brainstem and below the cerebral cortex.
- serves as a relay station for processing and transmitting olfactory information to higher brain regions.
- acts as a **relay station** for most sensory information traveling to the cerebral cortex
- Memory systems
	- Base of forebrain
	- Relays sensory information, a communication hub and modulates arousal and attention which influence how we encode and consolidate new information into memories  

## Source[^2]
- Most often described as a relay station because a great deal of the information that proceeds to the cortex first stops in the thalamus before being sent on to its destination
