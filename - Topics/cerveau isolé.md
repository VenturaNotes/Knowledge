- $n$. A surgical preparation in which the brainstem is severed between the diencephalon and the hindbrain, or between the superior colliculi and the inferior colliculi. Because it separates the brain from the ascending reticular activating system, cats operated on in this way show chronic somnolence, with only delta wave activity in their EEGs, their pupils are constricted, and no eye movements occur. See also DECEREbrate RIGIDITY. Compare ENCÉPHALE ISOLÉ. \[From French cerveau the cerebrum + isolé isolated]
