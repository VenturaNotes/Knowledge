- Data centers are the space where an organization’s back-end IT assets are stored and operated, including telecommunications systems and other systems that store data. In this space, all aspects of IT are conducted and data is stored, processed, and analyzed. Because critical components to the organization’s daily operations are stored in the data center, including routers, firewalls, and servers, they must be protected with proper security measures.
