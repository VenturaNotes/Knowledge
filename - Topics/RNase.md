- (ribonuclease; RNAase) Any enzyme that catalyses the cleavage of nucleotides in RNA. Each RNase has a specificity for a different cleavage site. For example, RNase A is a digestive enzyme secreted by the pancreas that hydrolyses phosphodiester bonds in the nucleotide chain. Other RNases are active at the cellular level, for instance in modifying ribosomal RNA after transcription. RNase P cuts the $5^{\prime}$ end of precursors of transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules.
