- A spreadsheet having more than two dimensions. The basic spreadsheet is a table of rows and columns, and so is regarded as two-dimensional. A third dimension can be pictured as a stack of tables, or pages of a workbook. Mathematically there is no difficulty in having as many dimensions as required, but the visual representation on a flat display screen becomes rather difficult after the third dimension.
