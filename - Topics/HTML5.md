- HTML5 is the fifth major standard of hypertext markup language that is commonly used to present, modify, and adjust the appearance of webpages and their content. HTML5 was initially developed to fix compatibility issues that affected its predecessor, HTML4.
- Unlike HTML4, HTML5 does not require developers to use proprietary plug-ins and application programming interfaces (APIs) to present or modify the appearance of webpages and their content. HTML5 is fully capable of running various webpage elements by itself.
- HTML5 is free for anyone to use and incorporates easy-to-remember HTML tags such as `<video>, <audio>, <header>, <section>, <footer>`, and more. HTML5 is supported by all major browsers, including Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, which keeps web content consistent.
