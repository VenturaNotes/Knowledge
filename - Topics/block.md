- (1) A collection of data units such as words, characters, or records (generally more than a single word) that are stored in adjacent physical positions in memory or on a peripheral storage device. A block can therefore be treated as a single unit whereby data can be (and usually is) transferred between storage device and memory, using one instruction. Blocks may be fixed or variable in size. 
- (2) In coding theory, an ordered set of symbols, usually of a fixed length. The term is generally synonymous with word or string, but with the implication of fixed length. 
- (3) See BLOCK-STRUCTURED LANGUAGES. 
- (4) In parallel programming, to prevent further execution of one sequence of instructions until another sequence has done whatever is necessary to unblock it. See also BLOCKED PROCESS.
