- $n$. A toxic alkaloid drug, chemically related to choline, that was originally derived from the fly agaric mushroom Amanita muscaria, and that mimics acetylcholine at certain receptor sites in the parasympathetic and central nervous systems, stimulating smooth muscle activity. When ingested it causes abdominal contractions, evacuation of bowels and bladder, constricted pupils, blurred vision, sweating, salivation, bradycardia, and decreased respiration. Formula: $\mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{19} \mathrm{NO}_{3}$. See also CHOLINOMIMETIC, MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR, PARASYMPATHOMIMETIC. \[From Latin muscar(ius) of flies, from musca a fly + -ine indicating an organic compound]
