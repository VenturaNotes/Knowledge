- $n$. a genus of spiral flagellated Gram-negative bacteria. The species H. pylori (formerly classified as Campylobacter pylori) is found in the stomach within the mucous layer. It occurs in the majority of middleaged people and may cause gastritis. It is almost invariably present in duodenal ulceration and usually in gastric ulceration. Testing to confirm infection includes the urea breath test. Eradication of the organism (using various combinations of antibiotics and antisecretory drugs) promotes ulcer healing. H. pylori has been implicated in some forms of stomach cancer and in coronary heart disease. The role of other Helicobacter species in the causation of disease in humans is unclear.
