In psychoanalysis, a key aspect of female psychology, originating in a girl's discovery of the anatomic differences between the sexes, causing her to feel deprived, and later, during the Oedipal phase, to develop a desire for a penis, manifested symbolically as a desire to have a child or to possess a penis in sexual intercourse. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced the concept in 1914 in connection with the castration complex in girls in his article 'On Narcissism: An Introduction' (Standard Edition, XIV, pp. 73-102, at p. 92) and developed it further in an article in 1917 'On the Transformations of Instinct, as Exemplified in Anal Erotism' (Standard Edition, XVII, pp. 127-33). The concept was rejected by the German-born US psychoanalyst Karen Horney (1885-1952) and the Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones (1879-1958), among others, and was given less prominence by the British-based Austrian psychoanalyst Melanie Klein (1882-1960).
