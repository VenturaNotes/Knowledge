## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (JH) A hormone secreted by insects from a pair of endocrine glands (corpora allata) close to the brain. In the larva it modulates the activity of ecdysone, promoting the formation of larval features and inhibiting metamorphosis, the latter occurring only when levels of JH decline. In adult insects it promotes the development of accessory sex glands, and in females induces synthesis of yolk proteins and promotes egg maturation.
