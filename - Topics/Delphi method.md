- $n$. A method of research, analysis, decision making, and often forecasting, developed in the early 1950s by the RAND Corporation in the US, involving the repeated collection and distribution of the judgements and opinions of individual experts through the exchange of written documents or electronic mail. Proponents claim that it avoids domination of the decision process by forceful personalities and the disrupting effects of interpersonal dynamics in face-to-face groups. Also called the Delphi technique. \[Named after the oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece]
