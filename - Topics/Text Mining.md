- Text mining means extracting information from textual data and using that information to meet business objectives. The text mining process involves transforming unstructured text in databases and documents into structured data, making it easier to run that information through analytics and business intelligence (BI) tools. When businesses use text mining to turn textual data into a format for analytics, they can generate patterns and insights from that data. Text mining might consist of tokenization, which turns long-form text into words and sentences called 'tokens.' Alternatively, stemming might take place, which separates a suffix or prefix from a word to determine that word's meaning.
