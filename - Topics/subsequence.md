## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- (1) A function whose domain is a subset of the positive integers and hence whose image set can be listed:$$\begin{aligned}

& s_{i1}, s_{i 2}, \ldots s_{i m} \\

& \text {where } i 1<i 2<\ldots<i m

\end{aligned}$$(2) The listing of the image set of a subsequence. Hence a subsequence of a string $a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}$ is any listing of the form$$

\begin{aligned}

& a_{i 1}, a_{i 2}, \ldots a_{i m} \\

& \text {where } 1 \leq i 1<i 2 \ldots<i m \leq n

\end{aligned}
