- Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) and Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) are widely used communication protocols. They are used for the high-speed transmission of voice and data signals across worldwide fiber optic networks. SDH/SONET use LEDs or lasers to send a binary stream of light pulses to optical sensors at the receiving end. SDH is an ITU-T (Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunications Union) standard. SONET is a standard used in the United States.
