- (1) Communication using a modulated carrier (see MODULATION) to apply a data signal to a transmission medium in analogue form. Multiple signals can be present simultaneously using frequency division multiplexing. Different bandwidths may be allocated to different signals, and different kinds of traffic (digital data, analogue voice, television) may be carried at the same time. See also BROADBAND COAXIAL SYSTEMS. Compare BASEBAND NETWORKING. 
- (2) A term sometimes used for wideband networking, i.e. networking with wideband channels (see BANDWIDTH).
