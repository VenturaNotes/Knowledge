- Fiber to the Home, or fiber to the premises, is a method that involves the use of optical fibers to provide high-speed internet access from one main access point to several other locations. Typically, copper cables or satellite signals are used to perform this function, but with FTTH, the speeds are much faster. Additionally, the signal is much more reliable and allows several different devices to connect at once without interruption.
