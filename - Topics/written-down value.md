- (WDV) The value of an asset for tax purposes after taking account of its reduction in value below the initial cost, as a result of its use in the trade. An asset acquired for a trade is eligible for capital allowances. A writing-down allowance of $25 \%$ is available in the year of purchase, which is deducted from the initial cost to establish the written-down value. In the following year the written-down value is subject to the $25 \%$ writing-down allowance, which is deducted to arrive at the written-down value at the end of the second year. The table shows the WDA and WDV for an asset acquired for $£ 1000$. The written-down value of the asset, for tax purposes, at the end of year 2 is $£ 563$.
