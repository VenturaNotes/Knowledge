- (PNH) a type of acquired haemolytic anaemia that results from an abnormality of the red blood cell membrane. It is due to a defect in the formation of glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI), whose role is to anchor proteins to the lipid framework of the membrane. This leads to increased complementmediated destruction of red blood cells, which results in the release of haemoglobin in the circulation and then in the urine, giving the latter a reddish colour. Some patients may develop blood clots.
