- $n$. a microscope for examining particles suspended in a gas or liquid under intense illumination from one side. Light is scattered or reflected from the particles, which can be seen through the eyepiece as bright objects against a dark background.
## Source[^2]
- A form of microscope that uses a sheet of laser light projected from either side to illuminate a thin horizontal plane through a specimen. This means there is no interference from out-of-focus light above or below the illuminated plane. Light from the specimen is focused by an objective lens positioned above and passes through a filter and a tube lens to a camera, which records the image. The specimen is moved stepwise vertically through the light sheet, and the resultant stack of images is used to construct a threedimensional picture of the object, with micrometre resolution. Specimens are prepared by various fluorescent staining techniques, and fluorescence is thus confined to the illuminated plane. Solid specimens are first subject to a clearing process to make them transparent.
