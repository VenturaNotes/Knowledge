- Multichannel multipoint distribution service (MMDS) is a wireless broadband service that uses microwave frequencies to deliver content such as television programming and internet access to subscribers. While it was initially designed for rural areas, it has since been adopted by some urban providers. It allows customers to receive content without wires running into their home or business, which can be inconvenient.
