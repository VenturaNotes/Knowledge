- (after market) A market in which existing securities are traded, as opposed to a primary market, in which securities are sold for the first time. In most cases a stock exchange largely fulfils the role of a secondary market, with the flotation of new issues representing only a small proportion of its total business. However, it is the existence of a flourishing secondary market, providing liquidity and the spreading of risks, that creates the conditions for a healthy primary market.

- The market for resale of shares. This is distinct from the market for new issues: the vast majority of dealings in shares is in secondary markets. The existence of a liquid secondary market for shares is an important factor in making them saleable as new issues. If people intending to buy newly issued shares knew they could not sell them readily, but had to retain them permanently, they would be much more reluctant to risk buying them in the first place.
