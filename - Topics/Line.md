- Defined in Euclid as a length without breadth. The term ‘straight line’ is used where appropriate. However, where no ambiguity results, the word straight is omitted. Similarly, a line is usually taken as extending indefinitely in both directions, and the term ‘line segment’ is used to specify the part of a line joining two points.
