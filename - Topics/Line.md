## Source [^1]
- Defined in Euclid as a length without breadth. The term 'straight line' is used where appropriate. However, where no ambiguity results, the word straight is omitted. Similarly, a line is usually taken as extending indefinitely in both directions, and the term 'line segment' is used to specify the part of a line joining two points.
## Source[^2]
- LINE: (long interspersed element) Any of a class of dispersed moderately repetitive DNA found in eukaryotes, consisting of numerous copies of relatively long (generally 6-8 kb) sequences scattered throughout the genome. LINEs are retrotransposons and can spread by reverse transcription: an RNA transcript is formed, then a DNA copy of this, which subsequently undergoes insertion into the genome. However, many have lost this ability to move about the genome and are in effect 'molecular fossils'. In total LINEs account for about $20 \%$ of the human genome, of which most belong to the $\mathbf{L 1}$ family. These are 6 kb long and represent about $17 \%$ of the total human DNA. Active L1 LINEs contain two large coding regions plus noncoding flanking sequences. One of these encodes both an endonuclease and a reverse transcriptase.
