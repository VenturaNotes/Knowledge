- conjunctivitis occurring in newborn infants. The two most common infections are gonorrhoea and Chlamydia (see INCLUSION CONJUNCTIVITIS); the infection may be contracted as the baby passes through an infected birth canal. If left untreated, it may cause lasting damage to the eye. Diagnosis should be confirmed with microbiological studies, and both baby and mother treated with appropriate antibiotics.
