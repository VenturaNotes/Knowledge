- $n$. a technique for observing the amount and/or distribution of antibody or antigen in a tissue section. The antibodies are labelled (directly or indirectly) with a fluorescent dye (e.g. fluorescein) and applied to the tissue, which is observed through an ultraviolet microscope. In direct immunofluorescence the antibody is labelled before being applied to the tissue. In indirect immunofluorescence the antibody is labelled after it has bound to the antigen, by means of fluorescein-labelled anti-immunoglobulin serum. $\textemdash$immunofluorescent adj.
