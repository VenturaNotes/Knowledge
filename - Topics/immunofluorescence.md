- $n$. a technique for observing the amount and/or distribution of antibody or antigen in a tissue section. The antibodies are labelled (directly or indirectly) with a fluorescent dye (e.g. fluorescein) and applied to the tissue, which is observed through an ultraviolet microscope. In direct immunofluorescence the antibody is labelled before being applied to the tissue. In indirect immunofluorescence the antibody is labelled after it has bound to the antigen, by means of fluorescein-labelled anti-immunoglobulin serum. $\textemdash$immunofluorescent adj.
## Source[^2]
- A technique used to identify specific proteins in tissue samples by applying antibodies that have been labelled with a fluorescent compound (e.g. fluorescein). The labelled antibody combines with the protein under investigation and the resulting complex can be identified under a microscope by its fluorescence (i.e. immunofluorescence microscopy). Proteins and enzymes in tissue samples can be identified and located in this way. In indirect immunofluorescence the bound antibody is detected by an 'anti-antibody' fluorescent immunoglobulin.
