- An autonomous system number (ASN) is a unique number that is given to local networks by the American Registry for Internet Numbers. The number defines the owner's network, and no ASN is the same or reused, even across the globe. They may be either public or private, but a public ASN must be used in order to connect and exchange information with other parties online. This allows network operators to have greater control over their networks while being able to exchange data and information with other Internet Service Providers (ISP).
