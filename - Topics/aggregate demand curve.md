- Description
	- The aggregate demand curve represents the total quantity of goods and services demanded across all levels of an economy at various price levels
	- It illustrates the relationship between the overall price level and the quantity of output demanded, showing how changes in price influence consumer spending, investment and government expenditures.
	- This curve is downward sloping, indicating that as prices decrease, the quantity of goods and services demanded increases, highlighting the inverse relationship between price levels and demand
- This curve shifts due to changes in consumer confidence, government policies, and external factors like global economic conditions
- A rightward shift in the aggregate demand curve indicates an increase in total demand at all price levels, often resulting from increased consumer spending or government expenditure
- Factors leading to a leftward shift. These factors reduce spending
	- Rising interest rates
	- Decreased consumer confidence
	- Higher taxes
