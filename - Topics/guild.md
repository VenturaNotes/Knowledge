- (in ecology) A group of species within a community that exploit the same resources in a similar way. Thus, for example, different species of snakes and lizards may belong to a guild by virtue of occupying the same types of underground shelters, and different species of seed-eating birds may constitute a guild. Any particular species can belong to multiple guilds$\textemdash$for example, one based on feeding habit and a second defined by nest-site choice$\textemdash$depending on whether or not it meets the functional criterion for membership.
