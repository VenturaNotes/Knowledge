- $n$. 
- (1) the mammary gland of a woman: one of two compound glands that produce milk. Each breast consists of glandular lobules $\textendash$ the milk-secreting areas $\textendash$ embedded in fatty tissue (see illustration). The milk passes from the lobules into ducts, which join up to form 15-20 lactiferous ducts. Near the front of the breast the lactiferous ducts are dilated into ampullae, which act as reservoirs for the milk. Each lactiferous duct discharges through a separate orifice in the nipple. The dark area around the nipple is called the areola. See also lactation. Anatomical name: mamma. 
- (2) the front part of the chest (thorax).
