- A gateway server is a point in a network where data leaves one device or network and is routed to another. A gateway transforms or consolidates the data so it can be accepted and understood by the receiving device or network. Itâ€™s a way of translating data so the flow of data remains continuous. An example is Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) systems, in which the gateway translates audio into pure data and then back into audio so the receiving person can hear the caller, and vice versa.
