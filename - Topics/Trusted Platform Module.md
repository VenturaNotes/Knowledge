- A trusted platform module (TPM) is a small chip on a computer ªs motherboard that secures hardware using cryptographic keys. A TPM chip includes a variety of physical security mechanisms, making it tamper-resistant. TPMs can be software-based, firmware-based, physical-based, or discrete TPMs. Common TPM functions include authenticating user devices, providing security against cyberthreats such as firmware and ransomware attacks, protecting digital media rights, and ensuring platform integrity. TPM chips can also store certificates, encryption keys, and passwords. TPM chips are compatible with all major operating systems and work best alongside firewalls, antivirus software, smart cards, and other security technologies.
