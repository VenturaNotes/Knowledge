It contains 140 items, each scored on a 3-point or 4-point scale, and it is designed for use by experienced clinicians. It was constructed by the English psychiatrist John Kenneth Wing (1923-2010) and several colleagues, an early version being published in the British Journal of Psychiatry in 1967 and a widely used revision as a separate publication in 1974.
