- An equilibrium concept for a game of strategy. A set of strategies (one for each player) constitutes a Nash equilibrium if no player has an incentive to change their strategy given the strategies chosen by the other players. Formally, let $s_{i}$ be the strategy of player $i$ and $s_{-i}$ the vector of strategies of other players. Then the strategies constitute a Nash equilibrium if, for every player $i, U\left(s_{i}, s_{-i}\right) \geq U\left(\sigma_{i}, s_{-i}\right)$ for every alternative strategy $\sigma_{i}$ of player $i$. The Nash equilibrium is the standard equilibrium concept in game theory. There are some games for which the Nash equilibrium has unusual properties and several 'refinements' of Nash equilibrium have been considered. None of these has seen widespread adoption.
