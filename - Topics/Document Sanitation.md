- Document sanitation is the process of removing any information from a document that is not to be seen by the document ªs intended audience. This includes document metadata such as the names of document authors, a document's revision history, its date of creation, and collaboration notes that could pose a privacy or security risk. Businesses often remove metadata from a document by converting it to portable document format (PDF) before giving it to its intended audience.
