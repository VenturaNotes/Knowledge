- $n$. A rare neurological disorder, easily diagnosed by brain imaging, with reported incidence somewhere between 0.5 and 70 in 10,000 births, in which the corpus callosum is either partially or entirely absent at birth. In the absence of other abnormalities, the associated disconnection syndrome may be mild, but when other brain abnormalities are present, the condition may be accompanied by mental retardation, seizures, spasms, and hydrocephalus. The savant Kim Peek (1951-2009), played by Dustin Hoffman (born 1937) in the 1988 film Rain Man, had agenesis of the corpus callosum, together with other brain disorders. AgCC or ACC abbrev. \[From Greek $a$ - without + genesis birth or origin + Latin corpus a body + callosus callous]
