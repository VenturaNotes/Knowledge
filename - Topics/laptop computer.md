- (notebook) A small personal computer that can be simply carried around by one person and used in transit from internal battery power. Laptops typically have all the features of a desktop model; the flat display screen folds over the keyboard when not in use. They are constructed from components chosen for their lightness, small size, and low power consumption. These tend to make laptops more expensive than their desktop equivalents. See also NOTEBOOK, PALMTOP COMPUTER.
