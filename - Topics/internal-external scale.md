- $n$. A 29-item questionnaire designed to measure locus of control. The respondent chooses one statement that 'I believe more strongly' from each of the 29 pairs, 23 of the items measuring locus of control and the remaining six being fillers unrelated to locus of control. A typical item from the scale is: I believe more strongly that: (a) Whether I make a success of my life is entirely up to me; (b) Success is a matter of being lucky enough to be in the right place at the right time. Another typical item is: I believe more strongly that: (a) Pressure groups can influence government decisions; (b) The government is beyond the influence of the ordinary person. In both examples, (a) indicates internal and (b) external locus of control. The scale was introduced in an article in the journal Psychological Monographs in 1966 by the US psychologist Julian B(ernard) Rotter (1916-2014). I-E scale abbrev.
