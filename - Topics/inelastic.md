- Lacking in responsiveness. Where one variable, $x$, can affect another, $y$, the relation is inelastic if a proportional change in $x$ is associated with a smaller proportional change in $y$, of whichever sign is appropriate. For example, the demand for a good is inelastic if a fall in price produces a smaller proportional increase in quantity demanded, so that total revenue falls when quantity increases, and marginal revenue is negative.
