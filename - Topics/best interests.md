- a legal and ethical standard in medical care and treatment. A doctor has both an ethical and a legal obligation to maximize a patient's welfare or wellbeing. When cases have gone to court, the judiciary has been clear that the concept of best interests extends beyond the purely medical. The principle of autonomy requires that a patient with capacity is in the best position to determine what is in his or her best interests. Where a patient lacks capacity, health-care professionals must act in his or her best interests. Under the Mental Capacity Act 2005, a doctor must take account of the patient's wishes and try to determine what he or she would have wanted, possibly with reference to an advance directive (see ADVANCE DIRECTIVE, DECISION, OR STATEMENT), an appointed proxy, or an independent mental capacity advocacy service. The interests of children are especially important, and doctors must be particularly vigilant where there is a potential conflict of interests, as when reporting cases of suspected child abuse or recruiting for paediatric research.
