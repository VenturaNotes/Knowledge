- A polysaccharide comprising chains of $N$-acetyl-D-glucosamine, a derivative of glucose. Chitin is structurally very similar to cellulose and serves to strengthen the supporting structures of various invertebrates. For example, the exoskeleton of arthropods contains about $30\text{-}50 \%$ chitin embedded in a protein matrix. It also occurs in fungi, strengthening the cell walls of hyphae.
