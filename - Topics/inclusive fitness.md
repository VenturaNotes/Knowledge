- The quality that organisms attempt (unconsciously) to maximize as the result of natural selection acting on genes that are influential in controlling their behavior and physiology. It includes the individual's own reproductive success (i.e. direct fitness, usually taken as the number of its offspring that survive to adulthood) and also the effects of the individual's actions on the reproductive success of its relatives (i.e. indirect fitness), because relatives have a higher probability of sharing some identical genes with the individual than do other members of the population. When interactions between relatives are likely to occur (which happens during the lives of many animals and plants) kin selection will operate.

- $n$. The degree of adaptation (1) of an organism to its environment, measured in terms of the average number of genes belonging to its genotype that are passed on to the next generation, relative to those of other genotypes, taking into account not only the genes that it passes on directly but also those that it shares with other relatives and are passed on by them. The concept was introduced by the British biologist William D(onald) Hamilton (1936-2000) in two articles in the Journal of Theoretical Biology in 1964. See also Kin selection. Compare Darwinian FITNESS, FITNESS.
