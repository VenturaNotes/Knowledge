- a diagnostic sign for carpal tunnel syndrome. The patient is asked to hold his or her wrists in full flexion with the dorsal surfaces of both hands pushing against each other with fingers pointing downwards for 30-60 seconds. This manoeuvre increases pressure on the median nerve: tingling and numbness or pain in the thumb, index, middle, and ring fingers suggests carpal tunnel syndrome. See also TinEl's Sign. \[G. S. Phalen (1911-98), US orthopaedist]
