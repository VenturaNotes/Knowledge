- A model that simulates the elements or variables inherent in a business decision, together with their relationships to each other and the constraints under which they operate; the purpose of the model is to enable a solution to be arrived at in keeping with the objectives of the organization. For example, a linear programming decision model may arrive at a particular production mix that, having regard to the constraints that exist, either minimizes costs or maximizes the contribution. Other decision models include decision trees and discounted cash flow.
