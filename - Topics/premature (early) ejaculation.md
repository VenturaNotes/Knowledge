A sexual dysfunction in DSM-5 characterized by persistent or recurrent orgasm and ejaculation following minimal sexual stimulation and before they are wanted, usually prior to or around the time of penetration, making sexual intercourse difficult or impossible and causing significant distress or problems of interpersonal interaction. It is not diagnosed if it is attributable to a drug, many medicinal drugs producing these symptoms as a side-effect. Also called ejaculatio praecox. See also sQUEEze technique. \[From Latin praematurus unduly early, from prae before + maturus ripe + e from + iaculatus thrown, from iacere to throw + -ation indicating a process or condition]
