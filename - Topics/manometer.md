- $n$. a device for measuring pressure in a liquid or gas. A manometer often consists of a U-tube containing mercury, water, or other liquid, open at one end and exposed to the fluid under pressure at the other end. The pressure can be read directly from a graduated scale. See also SPHYGMOMANOMETER.
## Source[^2]
- A device for measuring pressure differences, usually by the difference in height of two liquid columns. The simplest type is the U-tube manometer, which consists of a glass tube bent into the shape of a $U$. If a pressure to be measured is fed to one side of the $U\text{-tube}$ and the other is open to the atmosphere, the difference in level of the liquid in the two limbs gives a measure of the unknown pressure.
