- The buying of securities, commodities, etc., by a broker because the original seller has failed to deliver. This invariably happens after a rise in a market price (the seller would be able to buy in himself if the market had fallen). The broker buys at the best price available and the original seller is responsible for any difference between the buying-in price and the original buying price, plus the cost of buying in. Compare SELLING OUT.
