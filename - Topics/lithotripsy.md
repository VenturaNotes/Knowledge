- (1) the process of breaking calculi (stones) into smaller fragments by the application of shock waves. This will enable the stones to pass naturally or be removed more easily. In extracorporeal shock-wave lithotripsy (ESWL), used for breaking calculi in the upper urinary tract, the shock waves are generated and transmitted by an external power source. The specialized machine (a lithotripter) consists of a sophisticated radiological system to localize the stone accurately by biplanar X-ray and a shock head or transducer to produce and focus the energy source. The prototype machines required the patient to be anaesthetized and immersed in a water bath for treatment, but modern machines require neither water bath nor general anaesthesia. In electrohydraulic lithotripsy (EHL), used for breaking urinary calculi, an electrically generated shock wave is transmitted to the stone by a contact probe delivered via a nephroscope or ureteroscope. Laser lithotripsy has also been available since the 1980s.
