- Attitude. The components of attitude.
- Attitude is traditionally divided into cognitive, behavioral, and affective components, although the main emphasis now tends to fall on defining attitude in terms of affect - the person's feelings towards the object, brand, etc. Is the brand good or bad? Is it likeable? The importance of the cognitive and behavioral components is still accepted, but they are no longer regarded as critical components.

- (1) An enduring pattern of evaluative responses towards a person, object, or issue. According to a frequently quoted classical definition, it is a more or less consistent pattern of affective, cognitive, and conative or behavioral responses (or of feeling, thinking, and behaving) towards a psychological object, but the consistency implied by this definition is a supposition that is frequently unmatched by reality, and it is possible to have an attitude towards something without ever having the opportunity to express it in behavior. See also attitude change, attitude scale, dualPROCESS MODEL, ELABORATION LIKELIHOOD MODEL, EXPECTANCY-VALUE THEORY, IMPLICIT ATTITUDE, SELF-PERCEPTION THEORY, THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR, THEORY OF REASONED ACTION.
