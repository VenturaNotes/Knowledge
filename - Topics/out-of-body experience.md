- $n$. A form of depersonalization characterized by a sense of detachment from one's body and perception of oneself from a distance, usually from above. It is often associated with sleep deprivation, some forms of drug intoxication, or mental disorders such as schizophrenia and certain dissociative disorders. It is sometimes (and perhaps generally) triggered by sleep paralysis. The term was introduced in 1968 by the US journalist and psychic Susy Smith (1911-2001) in the title of her book Out-of-Body Experiences for the Millions. See also NEAR-DEATH EXPERIENCE. OBE or OOBE abbrev.
