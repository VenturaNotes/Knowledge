- A method of calculating the amount by which a fixed asset is to be depreciated in an accounting period, in which the depreciation to be charged against income is based on the original cost or valuation, less the asset's estimated net residual value, divided by its estimated life in years. This has the effect of a constant annual depreciation charge against profits year by year. In some circumstances the net residual value is ignored.
