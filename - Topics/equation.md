- A statement that asserts that two mathematical expressions are equal in value. If this is true for all values of the variables involved then it is called an identity, for example $3(x-2) = 3x-6,$ and where it is only true for some values it is called a conditional equation; for example $x^2-2x-3 = 0$ is only true when $x = -1$ or $3$, which are known as the roots of the equation.
