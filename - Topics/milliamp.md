- $n$. short for milliampere: one thousandth of an ampere ($10^{-3} \mathrm{~A}$; symbol: mA ). In radiography, the mA setting on an X-ray machine determines the number of X-ray photons produced per second. The setting is important to obtain appropriate exposure and varies with body size (among other factors). See also KILOVOLT.
