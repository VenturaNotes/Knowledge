- (EPOS) A computerized method of recording sales in retail outlets, using a laser scanner at the checkout till to read bar codes printed on the items' packages. Other advantages over conventional checkout points include a more efficient use of checkout staff time, the provision of a more detailed receipt to the customer, and real-time stock control, enabling rapid replenishment of stock and minimizing the stock that has to be held. In consumer goods sales, the data can also be used to produce consumer profiles for marketing purposes.
