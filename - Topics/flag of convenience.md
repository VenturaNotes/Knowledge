- The national flag of a small country, such as Panama, Liberia, or the Bahamas, flown by a ship that is registered in one of these countries, although the ship is owned by a national of another country. The practice of registering ships in these countries, and sailing them under flags of convenience, grew up in the 1920s and still continues despite attempts to control it. The object for the shipowners is to avoid taxation, high labor costs, and the more stringent safety and humanitarian conditions imposed on ships and their crews by the larger sea-going nations.

- A national registration for a ship which does not correspond to its actual ownership or control. Owners may choose this for tax reasons, to avoid stringent controls on safety and manning prevailing in their own countries, or to allow the use of foreign crew at lower wages than those payable to their own nationals.
