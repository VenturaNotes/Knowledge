## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The physical phenomenon that causes some materials to have zero electrical resistance when held at very low temperatures. Superconductivity is of interest to computer engineers since it points to the possibility of great computing power with little or no heat generation. This is especially so since the recent demonstration of superconductivity in certain complex metallic oxides at relatively high temperatures.
