- A picocell is a short-range cellular base station connected to a network through the internet. It helps improve phone reception in buildings. Considered smaller than a microcell, a picocell typically provides a 100-to-250-meter range when boosting cellular coverage in high-traffic locations such as residential areas. Cellular companies own and operate picocells.
