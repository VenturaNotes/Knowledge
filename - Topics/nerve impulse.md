- the electrical activity in the membrane of a neuron that $\textendash$ by its rapid spread from one region to the next $\textendash$ is the means by which information is transmitted within the nervous system along the axons of the neurons. The membrane of a resting nerve is charged (polarized) because of the different concentrations of ions inside and outside the cell. When a nerve impulse is triggered, a wave of depolarization spreads, and ions flow across the membrane (see ACTION POTENTIAL). Until the nerve has undergone repolarization no further nerve impulses can pass.

- $n$. An electrical impulse traveling along an axon when a neuron is stimulated, also called an action potential. Compare GrADED POTENTIAL.
