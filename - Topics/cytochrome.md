## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a compound consisting of a protein linked to haem. Cytochromes act as electron transfer agents in biological oxidation-reduction reactions, particularly those associated with the mitochondria in cellular respiration. See ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN.
## Source[^2]
- Any of a group of proteins, each with an iron-containing haem group, that form part of the electron transport chain in mitochondria and chloroplasts. Electrons are transferred by reversible changes in the iron atom between the reduced Fe (II) and oxidized $\mathrm{Fe}(\mathrm{III})$ states. There are four subclasses, designated $a$ to $d$, with different chemical configurations of the haem group. Members of each group can be denoted by a suffixed number (e.g. cytochrome $b_{2}$ ) or by the characteristic wavelength (in nanometres) at which they maximally absorb light (e.g. cytochrome $c_{555}$ ). See also CYTOCHROME OXIDASE.
