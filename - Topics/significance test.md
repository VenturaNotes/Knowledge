- A statistical procedure whereby a quantity computed from data samples is compared with theoretical values of standard probability distributions. Formally it is a comparison between a null-hypothesis, $\mathrm{H}_{0}$ (for example that there is no difference between the means of two populations), and an alternative hypothesis, $\mathrm{H}_{1}$, (that a real difference exists). If $\mathrm{H}_{0}$ is assumed to be true, the probability distribution of the test statistic can be computed or tabulated. If the test statistic exceeds the critical value corresponding to a probability level of $\alpha$ per cent, the null-hypothesis is rejected at the $\alpha$ per cent significance level. The most commonly used levels of significance are $5 \%$, $1 \%$, and $0.1 \%$. Care must be taken to specify exactly what alternative hypothesis is being tested. Tests involving both tails of the probability distribution are known as two-tailed tests; those involving only one tail are one-tailed tests.
