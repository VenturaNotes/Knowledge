- Methods of exploring respondents' deepest feelings in marketing research, by asking them to project these feelings into an unstructured situation. This technique, which has been borrowed from clinical psychology, encourages respondents to reveal their unconscious feelings and attitudes, without realizing that they are doing so. Projective techniques used include: word association tests, sentence completion tests, story completion tests, and cartoons with blank balloons to fill in.
