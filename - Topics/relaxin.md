- A mammalian protein hormone produced by the corpus luteum in both nonpregnant and pregnant females and by the placenta during the terminal stages of pregnancy. In males it is synthesized by the prostate and released in seminal fluid. Among its many biological effects, it relaxes the pubic symphysis and dilates the cervix of the uterus, thereby aiding parturition.
