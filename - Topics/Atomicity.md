- A term used in connection with the extent to which a resource can be subdivided. For some resources the amount allocated to a process can be completely arbitrary; an example is processor time (outside critical sections). For other resources allocations must be in terms of a smallest allowable amount; an example might be memory, which may only be allocated in multiples of, say, 1024 bytes.
