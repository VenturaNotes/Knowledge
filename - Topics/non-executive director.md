- A director of a company who is not involved in the day-to-day management of the business but who is appointed to bring independent judgment on issues of strategy, performance, resources, and standards of conduct. In the UK the Corporate Governance Code requires public listed companies to appoint non-executive directors or to explain why they have not done so. Apart from their watchdog role, such directors are often employed for their prestige, experience, contacts, or specialist knowledge.

- A company director who is not a full-time executive employee of the firm. Non-executive directors are usually chosen either for their expertise in areas relevant to a company's activities, or because they have titles or hold other positions which lend respectability to bodies they join. They may well be executives of other companies.
