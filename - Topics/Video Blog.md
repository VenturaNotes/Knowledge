- A video blog, also known as a “vlog,” is a blog in the form of video clips. Vlogs can be instructional videos, travel updates, daily routines, product promotions, and much more. Vlogs can often be found on a companyʻs YouTube channel, TikTok profile, Facebook page, Instagram page, and even their company website. Vlog creation serves as a way for creatives to craft together audio, video, and graphics to generate content for their audience. Vlogs are also used as a form of advertising by businesses to generate revenue. Typically, vlogs create connection between the creator and its audience since the idea of a human being behind a business appeals to the customer. Ultimately, this increases website traffic and supports relationship building among a business and its target audience.
