- $n$. A common form of distortion in telephones and other auditory transmission systems in which the peaks of the waveform are flattened off$\textemdash$to only one or two per cent of their original height in severe peak clipping$\textemdash$transforming the waveform into a sequence of rectangular pulses. When applied to speech it has surprisingly little effect on its intelligibility, 80 or 90 per cent of words still being correctly interpreted by listeners when the clipping is severe.
