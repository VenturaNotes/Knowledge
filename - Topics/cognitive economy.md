- $n$. The tendency for cognitive processes to minimize processing effort and resources. For example, we do not squander memory capacity on storing the information has two legs for every individual we know; instead, we store this fact as a general default assumption for people in general and add a separate memory has one leg or has no legs only in exceptional cases in which the default does not apply. See also COGNITIVE MISER, DEFAULT REASONING, PRINCIPLE OF LEAST EFFORT.
