- (metamerism; segmentation) The division of an animal's body (except at the head region$\textemdash$see CEPHALIZATION) into a number of compartments (segments or metameres) each containing the same organs. Metameric segmentation is most strongly marked in annelid worms (e.g. earthworms), in which the muscles, blood vessels, nerves, etc. are repeated in each segment. In these animals the segmentation is obvious both externally and internally. It also occurs internally in arthropods and in the embryonic development of all vertebrates, in which it is confined to parts of the muscular, skeletal, and nervous systems and does not show externally.
