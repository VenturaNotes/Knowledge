- Symbol $\psi_{\mathrm{m}}$. A component of water potential due to the adhesion of water molecules to nondissolved structures of the system, i.e. the matrix, such as plasma membranes or soil particles. It is always negative and is significant only outside living cells in relatively dry systems, for example soils, where much of the water is tightly bound to soil particles.
