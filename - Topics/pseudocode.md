- Pseudocode is an informal description of a software program that is written in natural human language instead of code syntax. Software programmers often use pseudocode as a template for an application's configuration that can be used later when developing code in a specific programming language such as Java or Python. However, before pseudocode can be used as a template, it is often inspected by a group of software designers to ensure it aligns with their program design specifications.
