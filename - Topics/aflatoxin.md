- Any of a family of toxic compounds produced by some fungi, particularly Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus, that can contaminate certain crops, such as maize and peanuts, under warm, humid conditions. Aflatoxins bind to DNA and prevent replication and transcription. They can cause acute liver damage and cancers: humans may be poisoned by eating stored peanuts and cereals contaminated with the mould or by eating meat and other products derived from animals that have fed on contaminated feed.
