## Source [^1]
- Any of a family of toxic compounds produced by some fungi, particularly Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus, that can contaminate certain crops, such as maize and peanuts, under warm, humid conditions. Aflatoxins bind to DNA and prevent replication and transcription. They can cause acute liver damage and cancers: humans may be poisoned by eating stored peanuts and cereals contaminated with the mould or by eating meat and other products derived from animals that have fed on contaminated feed.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a poisonous substance produced in the spores of the fungus Aspergillus flavus, which infects peanuts. The toxin is known to produce cancer in certain animals and is suspected of being the cause of liver cancers in human beings living in warm and humid regions of the world, where stored nuts and cereals may be contaminated by the fungus.
