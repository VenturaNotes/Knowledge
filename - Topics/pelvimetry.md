- $n$. measurement of the four internal diameters of the pelvis (transverse, anteroposterior, left oblique, and right oblique) on an X-ray image or by means of CT or MR scanning. Pelvimetry may be used to determine if a vaginal delivery will be possible, but it is an unreliable predictor of obstetric outcome and its use is outmoded. Clinical pelvimetry is a means of assessing pelvic capacity through a vaginal examination; it is subjective and its results must be used with caution.
