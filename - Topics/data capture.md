- A process for achieving the extraction of relevant data while the related transaction or operation is occurring. An example is a supermarket checkout equipped with point-of-sale terminals. The transaction is primarily concerned with the sale to the customer but while the purchased items are being entered onto the bill it is usual for the machine to record, and thus capture, data that will allow calculation of stock movement and other information.
- If the equipment for data capture is online to a computer system, it is part of a data collection process and may be referred to as either data capture or data collection equipment. The term data capture is often used where a computer system monitors (and maybe controls) laboratory instruments, process parameters, etc.; in this context it is also known as data logging.

- The insertion of information into a computerized system. For example, information about the sale of an item (the item sold, the sales price, and discount given, date and location of sale, etc.) is taken into the accounting system either at the point of sale in a retail organization by an electronic till or by keyboarding into the system when the invoice is prepared. This information is then readily available and up-to-date; it can also be used to adjust stock levels.
