- A series of arithmetic means calculated from data in a time series, which reduces the effects of temporary seasonal variations. For example, a moving average of the monthly sales figures for an organization might be calculated by averaging the 12 months from January to December for the December figure, the 12 months from February to January for the January figure, and so on.

- A class of data-smoothing techniques used in the analysis of economic and financial time series. A simple moving average is the arithmetic average of $n$ previous data points. A weighted moving average assigns lower weights to older data points, with the weights declining linearly or exponentially; the latter method is also referred to as exponential smoothing. See also MOVING AVERAGE PROCESS.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. In statistics, a sequence of numbers consisting of the averages of successive subsequences of a sequence of numbers, often computed from time series to smooth out short-term fluctuations and make underlying trends clearer. For example, the three-term moving average of the sequence $1,7,4,10,4$ is obtained by taking the mean of the first three numbers, then the mean of the second, third, and fourth, then the mean of the third, fourth and fifth, yielding $4,7,6$, which is much smoother. More generally, especially in time-series analysis, a moving average is a sequence of numbers consisting of weighted sums of successive subsequences of a sequence of numbers, whether or not the weights sum to unity as they do for simple averages. See also arima, white noise.
