- A series of arithmetic means calculated from data in a time series, which reduces the effects of temporary seasonal variations. For example, a moving average of the monthly sales figures for an organization might be calculated by averaging the 12 months from January to December for the December figure, the 12 months from February to January for the January figure, and so on.

- A class of data-smoothing techniques used in the analysis of economic and financial time series. A simple moving average is the arithmetic average of $n$ previous data points. A weighted moving average assigns lower weights to older data points, with the weights declining linearly or exponentially; the latter method is also referred to as exponential smoothing. See also MOVING AVERAGE PROCESS.
