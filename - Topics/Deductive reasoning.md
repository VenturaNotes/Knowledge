### Example
- Problem: Prove that the sum of two even numbers is always even
	- Definition of [[Even number|even numbers]]
		- A number is even if it can be written as $2k$, where $k$ is an integer. This is our starting [[axiom]]
	- Let's choose two arbitrary even numbers `a and b` where `m and n` are integers
		- $a = 2m$
		- $b = 2n$
	- Adding the arbitrary even numbers
		- $a + b = 2m + 2n = 2(m+n)$
	- Since $m + n$ is an [[integers|integer]] (since the sum of two integers is always an integer), we know the expression $a + b$ is [[divisible]] by 2, which means it's an even number
	- $\therefore$ we have shown that the sum of two even numbers is always even
- How was this deductive reasoning?
	- Started with a definition, applied logical steps, and arrived at a conclusion that was necessarily true based on the given premise
