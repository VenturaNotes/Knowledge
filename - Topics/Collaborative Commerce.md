- Collaborative Commerce, or C-commerce, refers to communication and interaction. This interaction can occur at multiple levels. They are common with internal communication (among employees or other partners) or among external stakeholders (customers who are located within certain industries). C-commerce allows for enhanced coordination and communication. This can lead to increased customer satisfaction and additional profit for the businesses in question. This occurs as a result of enhanced communication that can better identify methods of making a profit or fulfilling customer needs.
