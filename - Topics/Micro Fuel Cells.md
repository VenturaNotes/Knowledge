- Micro fuel cells (MFCs) are an energy-generating technology that uses a chemical reaction to produce electricity. MFCs are typically used as a batter alternative to power small devices such as cell phones and laptops. Micro fuel cells are a sustainable energy source and can be replenished by simply refueling with hydrogen or methanol.
