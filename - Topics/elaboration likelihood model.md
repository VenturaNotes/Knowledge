- $n$. A model of persuasion and attitude change according to which recipients of a persuasive message who are highly motivated and able to process the content of the message with care tend to elaborate or think about issue-relevant arguments, and if they find the arguments in the message compelling, then they may show lasting attitude change, whereas recipients whose motivation and processing ability are low are likely to be influenced by peripheral factors such as the attractiveness of the source, and any attitude change achieved by this peripheral route will tend to be short-lived and poorly predictive of behavior. The model was formulated in 1981 and revised in 1986 by the US psychologists Richard E(dward) Petty (born 1951) and John T(errance) Cacioppo (born 1951).
