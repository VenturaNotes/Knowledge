- A product that, contrary to normal theories of economic demand, tends to be bought in greater quantities as its price rises. It is typically an inferior good, such as a cheap staple food, for which there are limited substitutes. When the price of bread rises, for example, poorer families are less able to afford more expensive substitutes and will therefore consume more bread. The concept is named after the economist Sir Robert Giffen. Compare Veblen Good.

- A good for which quantity demanded falls when its price falls. This can in theory occur: a Giffen good must be inferior with limited possibilities for substitution. A fall in the price of a good increases real purchasing power: if the good is inferior the income effect of this rise in real income is negative. The substitution effect of a price fall cannot be negative, but it can be small. If the substitution effect is smaller than the negative income effect, the overall effect of a fall in price is a fall in consumption.
