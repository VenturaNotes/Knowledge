- $n$. a drug that causes widening of the blood vessels and therefore an increase in blood flow. Vasodilators are used to lower blood pressure in cases of hypertension. Coronary vasodilators, such as glyceryl trinitrate, increase the blood flow through the heart and are used to relieve and prevent angina. Large doses of coronary vasodilators cause such side-effects as flushing of the face, severe headache, and fainting. Peripheral vasodilators affect blood flow to the limbs; they include alpha blockers and some calcium-channel blockers. Certain of the latter (e.g. nifedipine) are used to treat conditions due to poor circulation, such as Raynaud's disease and intermittent claudication.
