- Anti-competitive business practices by large enterprises, i.e. those having (usually) a market share of at least $40 \%$ in at least one EU state. Examples of such activities, which are contrary to Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and the UK Competition Act 1998, include refusing to supply an existing customer and engaging in predatory pricing. The European Commission and the Competition and Markets Authority can fine businesses up to $10 \%$ of annual worldwide group turnover for breach of Article 102. High fines include $â‚¬899$ million against Microsoft in 2008.
