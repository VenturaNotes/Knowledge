- (meibomian cyst) $n$. a swollen sebaceous (meibomian) gland in the eyelid caused by blockage of its duct. The gland becomes inflamed and converted into a jelly-like mass, producing disfigurement of the lid. It may disappear spontaneously over a period of time but treatment by application of antibiotic ointments and/or surgical incision and curettage will result in its rapid cure.
