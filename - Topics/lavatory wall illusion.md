- $n$. A variant of the hollow squares illusion and the Münsterberg illusion, created by an alternating arrangement of square twotone tiles, each changing smoothly from light to dark along one axis, the effect being that the tiles appear misaligned and non-parallel. It was first reported in 1987 by the English optometrists J(oy) Margaret Woodhouse (born 1948) and Stephen P(hilip) Taylor (born 1951), who reproduced a photograph of a bathroom decorated with such tiles. See also café wall ILLUSION.
