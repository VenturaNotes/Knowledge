## Source [^1]
- the means by which information about health events from several different sources (e.g. hospital attendance, vaccination, and consultation with general practitioners) are all related to a specific individual in a common file or more usually a computerized record. This contrasts with data in which events only are recorded (see Hospital Episode Statistics) and two individuals treated for the same disease cannot be distinguished from one individual treated on two separate occasions.
