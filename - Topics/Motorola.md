- A US corporation originally devoted to the production of car radios. In the late 1950s it entered the semiconductor field and developed the 6800 and 68000 series of processors. These are generally regarded as a better design than the equivalent Intel processor chips and are widely used in embedded systems of all kinds. Motorola later participated in the PowerPC project. In 2011 Motorola separated into two independent, publicly traded companies: Motorola Solutions and Motorola Mobility. The latter was acquired by Google in 2012.
