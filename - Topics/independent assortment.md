- The separation of the alleles of one gene into the reproductive cells (gametes) independently of the way in which the alleles of other genes have segregated. By this process all possible combinations of alleles should occur equally frequently in the gametes. In practice this does not happen because alleles situated on the same chromosome tend to be inherited together (see HAPLOTYPE). However, if the allele pairs $A a$ and $B b$ are on different chromosomes, the combinations $A B, A b, a B$, and $a b$ will normally be equally likely to occur in the gametes. See MEIOSIS; MENDEL'S LAWS.
