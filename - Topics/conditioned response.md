- $n$. In classical conditioning, a learned response that follows a conditioned stimulus as a consequence of a process of classical conditioning. Conditioned is a slight mistranslation of conditional, the term originally used by the Russian physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849-1936), referring to a response occurring only conditionally (after a process of conditioning). Also called a conditioned reflex or a conditional reflex, presupposing that it arises from modification of a reflex arc. Compare UNCONDITIONED RESPONSE. CR abbrev.
