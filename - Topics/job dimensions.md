- The general scope of a particular job in terms of the tasks or duties that are typically required, e.g. secretarial duties or responsibility for financial decisions. Most job descriptions now cite the key dimensions of a job rather than attempting a comprehensive list of all the tasks that may be involved. The notion of job dimensions is sometimes extended to include the key competencies, including personality traits, that are held to be essential to performance of a job.
