## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- 4 kinds of building blocks
	- A, T, C, G
## Source[^2]
- The monomer, or building block, of DNA and RNA
## Source[^3]
- $n$. a compound consisting of a nitrogen-containing base (a purine or pyrimidine) linked to a sugar and a phosphate group. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) are long chains of linked nucleotides (polynucleotide chains), which in DNA contain the purine bases adenine and guanine and the pyrimidines thymine and cytosine; in RNA, thymine is replaced by uracil.
## Source[^4]
- Symbol nt. An organic compound consisting of a nitrogen-containing purine or pyrimidine base linked to a sugar (ribose or deoxyribose) and a phosphate group. DNA and RNA are made up of long chains of nucleotides (i.e. polynucleotides). Compare NUCLEOSIDE.
## Source[^5]
- $n$. A basic building block of DNA or RNA, consisting of a base (1) linked to a sugar (deoxyribose or ribose respectively) and a phosphate, long chains of such units constituting nucleic acids. \[From Latin nucleus a kernel, from nux, nucis a nut + -ide indicating membership of a particular group of chemical compounds]
