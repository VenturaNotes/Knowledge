- A fixed place of business that a taxpayer of one country has in another country, thus rendering the taxpayer liable to that second country's taxation. It will include a place of management, branch, office, factory or workshop, and long-term construction projects but it may exclude some sales offices and storage depots. The concept is important in double-taxation treaties.
