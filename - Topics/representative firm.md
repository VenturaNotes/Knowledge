- A single firm whose choices are representative of its industry. Assume all the firms in an industry have the same constant returns to scale technology and every firm acts as a price-taker. In equilibrium each firm must make zero profit and hence is indifferent to the level of output it produces. In contrast, the optimal capital-labor ratio is uniquely defined. The industry can therefore be modeled by a representative firm that has the same technology, chooses the same capital-output ratio, and produces the same output as the entire industry.
