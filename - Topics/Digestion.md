- $n$. the process in which ingested food is broken down in the alimentary canal into a form that can be absorbed and assimilated by the tissues of the body. Digestion includes mechanical processes, such as chewing, churning, and grinding food, as well as the chemical action of digestive enzymes and other substances (bile, acid, etc.). Chemical digestion begins in the mouth with the action of saliva on food, but most of it takes place in the stomach and small intestine, where the food is subjected to gastric juice, pancreatic juice, and succus entericus.
