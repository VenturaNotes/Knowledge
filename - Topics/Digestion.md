## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- The process by which large, complex molecules are broken down into smaller molecules that can be used by the body/cells
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the process in which ingested food is broken down in the alimentary canal into a form that can be absorbed and assimilated by the tissues of the body. Digestion includes mechanical processes, such as chewing, churning, and grinding food, as well as the chemical action of digestive enzymes and other substances (bile, acid, etc.). Chemical digestion begins in the mouth with the action of saliva on food, but most of it takes place in the stomach and small intestine, where the food is subjected to gastric juice, pancreatic juice, and succus entericus.
## Source[^3]
- The breakdown by a living organism of ingested food material into chemically simpler forms that can be readily absorbed and assimilated by the body. This process requires the action of digestive enzymes and may take place extracellularly (i.e. in the alimentary canal), as is the case in most animals; or intracellularly (e.g. by engulfing phagocytic cells), as occurs in many protists and in cnidarians.
