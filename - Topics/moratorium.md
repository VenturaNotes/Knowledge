- (1) An agreement between a creditor and a debtor to allow additional time for the settlement of a debt. 
- (2) A period during which one government permits a government of a foreign country to suspend repayments of a debt. 
- (3) A period during which all the trading debts in a particular market are suspended as a result of some exceptional crisis in the market. In these circumstances, not to call a moratorium would probably lead to more insolvencies than the market could stand. The intention of such a moratorium is, first, that firms should be given a breathing space to find out exactly what their liabilities are and, secondly, that they should be given time to make the necessary financial arrangements to settle their liabilities.
