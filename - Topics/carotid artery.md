- either of the two main arteries in the neck whose branches supply the head and neck. The common carotid artery arises on the left side directly from the aortic arch and on the right from the innominate artery. They ascend the neck on either side as far as the thyroid cartilage (Adam's apple), where they each divide into two branches, the internal carotid, supplying the cerebrum, forehead, nose, eye, and middle ear, and the external carotid, sending branches to the face, scalp, and neck.

- The major artery that supplies blood to the head. A pair of common carotid arteries arise from the aorta (on the left) and the innominate artery (on the right) and run up the neck; each branches into an external and an internal carotid artery, which supply the head.
