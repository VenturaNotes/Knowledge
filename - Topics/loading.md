- (1) The process of allocating jobs or orders to work centres within a production facility. If there is a range of jobs there could be a range of possible routes through the various work centres. Building up a profile of the load on each location enables approximate completion dates for each job to be estimated and bottlenecks in the system to be identified. Loading is based on average times and does not take into account job interference, etc. Forward loading begins with the present date and loads jobs forwards. Backward loading begins with the completion date and works backwards. See finite capacity loading; INFINITE CAPACITY LOADING. 
- (2) The addition of a charge to cover incidental expenses, administrative costs, profit, etc., on an insurance policy, bank account, or purchases of unit trusts. See BACK-END LOAD; FRONT-END LOAD.
