- (base date) The first of a series of years in an index. The value of the index in that year is often denoted by the number 100, enabling percentage rises (or falls) to be seen at a glance. For example, if a price index indicates that the current value is 195 , this will only be meaningful if it is compared to an earlier figure. This may be written: 195 (base year $1987=$ 100), making it clear that there has been a $95 \%$ increase in prices since 1987.
