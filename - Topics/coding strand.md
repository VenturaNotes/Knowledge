- (plus strand; sense strand) The strand in duplex DNA that by convention contains the same sequence of bases as that in the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from the DNA (except that the RNA has uracil substituting for thymine). It is complementary to the other anticoding strand, which is actually the one used as a template for mRNA assembly during transcription. See also POSITIVE-SENSE.
