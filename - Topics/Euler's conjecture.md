- Euler's conjecture was a generalization of Fermat's Last Theorem that has since been proved untrue. It stated that n-1 nth powers could never add to an nth power. For n = 3, this is a special case of Fermat and so true. But a counterexample to n=5 was found in 1966 and the smallest counterexample to n=4 is now known to be $95800^4 + 217519^4+414560^4 = 422481^4$
