Affected individuals are apparently male, but are tall and thin, with small testes, failure of normal sperm production (azoospermia), enlargement of the breasts (gynaecomastia), and absence of facial and body hair. \[H. F. Klinefelter (1912-90), US physician]
## Source[^2]
- A genetic disorder affecting men in which an individual gains an extra X chromosome, so that the usual karyotype of XY (see SEX CHROMOSOME) is replaced by one of XXY (see NONDISJUNCTION). Symptoms of Klinefelter's syndrome, named after US physician H. F. Klinefelter (1912-90), include underdeveloped testes, infertility, and some female characteristics (such as breast enlargement).
