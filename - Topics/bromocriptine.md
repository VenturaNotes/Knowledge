- $n$. a dopamine receptor agonist, derived from ergot, that is used in the treatment of disorders associated with excessive secretion of prolactin (such as prolactinoma and galactorrhoea), since it inhibits the secretion of this hormone by the pituitary gland. It may also be used to treat acromegaly, as it suppresses the release of growth hormone, and - rarely - parkinsonism. Side-effects may include nausea, constipation, drowsiness, and dizziness, and there is a risk of fibrosis.
