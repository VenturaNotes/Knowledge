## Source [^1]
- $n$. a dopamine receptor agonist, derived from ergot, that is used in the treatment of disorders associated with excessive secretion of prolactin (such as prolactinoma and galactorrhoea), since it inhibits the secretion of this hormone by the pituitary gland. It may also be used to treat acromegaly, as it suppresses the release of growth hormone, and - rarely - parkinsonism. Side-effects may include nausea, constipation, drowsiness, and dizziness, and there is a risk of fibrosis.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. Bromocriptine mesylate, an alkaloid drug derived from ergot that mimics the activity of dopamine and is used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and is also used to treat certain forms of amenorrhoea and female infertility, because it selectively inhibits the secretion of prolactin by the anterior pituitary. Also called Parlodel (trademark). See also antiparkinsonian, dopaminomimetic. \[From Greek bromos a bad smell + English ergocryptine a type of ergot, from ergot + Greek kryptos hidden + -ine indicating an organic compound]
