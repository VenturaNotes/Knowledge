- A ratio of the exchange rate that would equalize the price of the Big Mac sandwich between two countries to the actual exchange rate. This index, introduced in 1986 by The Economist magazine, is based on purchasing power parity theory, with the Big Mac used in place of a bundle of goods and services.

- An informal index sometimes used to judge whether current exchange rates are justified. It is based on the theory of purchasing power parity and uses the price of a Big Mac in a particular currency as its indicator-this being one product that is made to an identical specification worldwide. For example, in country A a Big Mac costs 2.50 units of currency Z whereas in country B it costs 5.40 units of currency Y. In theory, the result of price in $\mathrm{Z} /$price in Y (in this case $2.50 / 5.40=0.46$ ) should equate to the number of units of currency Z that can be exchanged for one unit of Y. If the current rate is (say) 0.7:1, then currency Y is significantly overvalued.
