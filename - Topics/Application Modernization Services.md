- Application modernization services involve the upgrading or changing of a business' applications so they perform better and keep pace with new technology or functionality. This can look like moving an on-premise application to the cloud to improve data security, selecting a new host for an application, re-engineering an application, or replacing an application altogether. Businesses can hire a third party to conduct application modernization services for them.
