- adj. Having uniform light intensity, pertaining to visual stimuli in which shapes or forms are defined by variations in color without any contrasts in lightness. If red and green stripes in motion on a television screen are adjusted so that they are isoluminant, then although the viewer can see that they have changed position from one moment to the next, the sensation of movement is either greatly reduced or entirely eliminated, because information about movement is processed by the color-blind magnocellular system; and for the same reason, binocular stereopsis and the other binocular and monocular cues used for depth perception do not function with isoluminant stimuli, which invariably appear flat and two-dimensional. Also called equiluminant. See also dark focus. isoluminance n. \[From Greek isos equal or the same + Latin lumen light]
