- $n$. (pl. teeth) one of the hard structures in the mouth used for cutting and chewing food. Each tooth is embedded in a socket in part of the jawbone (mandible or maxilla) known as the alveolar bone (or alveolus), to which it is attached by the periodontal membrane. The exposed part of the tooth (crown) is covered with enamel and the part within the bone (root) is coated with cementum; the bulk of the tooth consists of dentine enclosing the pulp (see illustration). The group of embryological cells that gives rise to a tooth is known as the tooth germ. There are four different types of tooth (see CANINE; INCISOR; PREMOLAR; MOLAR). See also DENTITION.
