- An ad blocker is an application, typically a plug-in or browser extension, that removes advertising material from websites. While a web page loads, ad blocking software compares the domain names of components loading on the web page against a list of elements it was built to block. If any component is flagged as advertising material, the ad blocker will automatically stop it from loading, successfully preventing advertisements from appearing on screen.
