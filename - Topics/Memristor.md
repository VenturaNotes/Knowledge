- A memristor is a device that limits the flow of electricity in a circuit. Memristors retain memory without power by remembering the amount of charge that flowed through them, even when switched off. This means they are non-volatile, and can store data forever using only their memory, making them an important component of electrical engineering. Memristors can also restore hard drives and improve security during power outages in data centers.
