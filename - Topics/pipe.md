- A command-line operator available in some operating systems whereby a number of processes (tasks), whose names are listed sequentially, are activated concurrently so that each process (after the first-named) accepts as its input the output from the immediately previously named process. The operating system provides buffering of data between the processes, and so the user is relieved of the necessity of specifying temporary files for receiving and delivering the data. Pipes are a notable feature of UNIX. See also COMMAND-LINE INTERFACE, FILTER.
