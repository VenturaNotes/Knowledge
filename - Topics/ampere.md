## Source [^1]
- An ampere is a unit of measure of the rate of electron flow or current in an electrical conductor.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the basic SI unit of electric current. It is equal to the current flowing through a conductor of resistance 1 ohm when a potential difference of 1 volt is applied between its ends. The formal definition of the ampere is the current that when passed through two parallel conductors of infinite length and negligible cross section, placed 1 metre apart in a vacuum, produces a force of $2 \times 10^{-7}$ newton per metre between them. Symbol: A.
