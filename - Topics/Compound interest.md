- compound interest The interest on a deposit or loan that itself earns interest in later periods, i.e. the interest due each period is added to the amount outstanding. Thus, at an interest rate of $100 r$ per cent per period, after 1 period an original deposit of $A$ amounts to $A(1+r)$; after 2 periods to $A(1+r)^{2}$; and after $N$ periods to $A(1+r)^{N}$. These successive values form a geometric progression with common ratio $(1+r)$. With continuously compounded interest the amount of deposit is an exponential function of time, $A e^{r t}$.
