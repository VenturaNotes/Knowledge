- $n$. literally 'a good death', normally understood as the act of deliberately taking life in order to relieve suffering. In voluntary euthanasia a person requests measures to be taken to end his or her life, usually by the direct administration of drugs (as opposed to being provided with drugs in assisted suicide). Voluntary euthanasia is lawful in a number of European jurisdictions, e.g. the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg. Involuntary (or compulsory) euthanasia is where society or those acting on authority give instructions to end the lives of individuals, such as infants, who cannot express their wishes or have not given consent. See also ARTIFICIAL NUTRITION AND HYDRATION; ASSISTED SUICIDE; DOCTRINE OF DOUBLE EFFECT; EXTRAORDINARY MEANS.

- The act of ending the life of a person or animal in order to prevent further suffering, e.g. from an incurable and painful disease. This can be achieved by administering a lethal drug or by withholding vital treatment. In human medicine euthanasia is fraught with ethical and legal problems, and is illegal in most countries. Where it is practised, strict safeguards are enforced to ensure that the patient's wishes are determined and adhered to. Euthanasia is widely performed in veterinary medicine.
