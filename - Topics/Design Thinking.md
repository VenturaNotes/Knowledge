- Design thinking is a problem-solving process that uses a creative approach to develop innovative solutions. It's unique in that it focuses on the user's needs rather than the limitations of the technology. This allows for a more holistic approach to problem-solving, leading to more creative and effective solutions. It involves coming up with ideas, testing them, and refining them until a final solution is reached. This type of thinking can be used in various fields, such as business, engineering, and architecture. It is a framework created to test the viability of new products, services, or processes.
