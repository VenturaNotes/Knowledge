- $n$. a process occurring in bacteria and plants in which the protoplasm shrinks away from the rigid cell wall when the cell is placed in a hypertonic solution. Plasmolysis is due to withdrawal of water from the cell by osmosis.
## Source[^2]
- The loss of water by osmosis from a plant cell to the extent that the cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. This happens when the cell is placed in a solution that has a higher solute concentration than that of the cell sap, i.e. it has a lower (more negative) water potential, since water always moves from an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential. Compare TURGOR.
