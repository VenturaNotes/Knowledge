- $n$. a spherical structure, $50-60 ~\mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter, that develops from the zygote (see OOKINETE) of the malarial parasite (Plasmodium) on the outer wall of the mosquito's stomach. The oocyst steadily grows in size and its contents divide repeatedly to form sporozoites, which are released into the body cavity of the mosquito when the oocyst bursts.
