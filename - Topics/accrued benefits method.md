- An actuarial method used in accounting for pension costs in which the actuarial value of liabilities relates at a given date to:
	- the benefits, including future increases promised by the rules, for the current and deferred pensioners and their dependants;
	- the benefits that the members assumed to be in service on the given date will receive for service up to that date only.
- Allowance may be made for expected increases in earnings after the given date, and for additional pension increases not promised by the rules. The given date may be a current or future date. The further into the future the adopted date lies, the closer the results will be to those obtained by a prospective benefits valuation method.
