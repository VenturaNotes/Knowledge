- $n$. A term introduced by the German-born US psychologist Ulrich (Richard Gustav) Neisser (1928-2012) for (a) the set of cognitive schemata that direct perceptual processes, (b) the perceptual responses through which perceptual information is sampled, and (c) the physical stimuli that give rise to perception, the assumption being that a cyclic feedback mechanism causes a change in (c) to lead to a change of (a), which in turn leads to a change in (b), which affects (c), and so on indefinitely. Also called the cyclic model of perception. See also CONSTRUCTIVISM.
