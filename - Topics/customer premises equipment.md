## Source[^1]
- CPE refers to any telecommunications device that physically stays with the customer for use instead of the service provider.Â Examples of common customer premises equipment include telephone handsets, cable TV boxes, and DSL routers. In most cases, these devices are rented from the service provider, and they will be serviced or replaced in the event of a problem. Their functionality is directly tied to the service and if the service is discontinued, a company will be directed to return them and will receive new CPE that is compatible with their new service provider.
