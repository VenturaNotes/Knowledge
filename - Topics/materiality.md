- The extent to which an item of accounting information is material. Information is considered material if its omission or misstatement could influence the decision making of its users. Materiality is therefore not an absolute concept but is dependent on the size and nature of an item and the particular circumstances in which it arises. It is recognized as an important principle in the Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland.
