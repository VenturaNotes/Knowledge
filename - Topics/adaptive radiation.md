- (divergent evolution) The evolution from one species of animals or plants of a number of different forms. As the original population increases in size it spreads out from its centre of origin to exploit new habitats and food sources. In time this results in a number of populations each adapted to its particular habitat: eventually these populations will differ from each other sufficiently to become new species. A good example of this process is the evolution of the Australian marsupials into species adapted as carnivores, herbivores, burrowers, fliers, etc. On a smaller scale, the adaptive radiation of the Gal√°pagos finches provided Darwin with crucial evidence for his theory of evolution (see DARWIN'S FINCHES).

- $n$. The evolutionary process whereby species that are descended from a common ancestor diverge to exploit different ecological niches.
