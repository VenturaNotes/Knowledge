- The solutions to many mathematical problems cannot be described exactly in full generality. Instead, a numerical method may be employed; that is, a solution —or an approximation to one— is obtained instead. The study of relevant theory and methods is called numerical analysis.
- The advent of very powerful computers means that such computational methods are increasingly important in modelling complex systems. For example, the design of aircraft and high-performance cars can now be extensively tested by simulations prior to physically building and testing models
