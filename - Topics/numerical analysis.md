- The solutions to many mathematical problems cannot be described exactly in full generality. Instead, a numerical method may be employed; that is, a solution —or an approximation to one— is obtained instead. The study of relevant theory and methods is called numerical analysis.
- The advent of very powerful computers means that such computational methods are increasingly important in modelling complex systems. For example, the design of aircraft and high-performance cars can now be extensively tested by simulations prior to physically building and testing models

## Source[^2]
- A branch of mathematics/computer science dealing with the study of algorithms for the numerical solution of problems formulated and studied in other branches of mathematics. Numerical analysis now plays a central role in engineering and in the quantitative parts of pure and applied science. The tasks of numerical analysis include the development of fast and reliable numerical methods together with the provision of a suitable error analysis. The algorithms are developed as computer programs, taking full account of machine architectures such as parallelism.
