- $n$. a swelling containing watery fluid (serum) and sometimes also blood (blood blister) or pus, within or just beneath the skin. Blisters commonly develop as a result of unaccustomed friction on the hands or feet or at the site of a burn but are also a feature of certain skin diseases. Blisters may be treated with antiseptics and dressings. An unduly painful blister may be punctured with a sterile needle so that the fluid is released.
