- A report on corporate governance issued in 1995 by a committee under the chairmanship of Sir Richard Greenbury. Developing a number of recommendations of the Cadbury Report, it stressed the importance of a remuneration committee of non-executive directors, the provision of information on remuneration policy in the annual report and accounts, and the restriction of notice and contract periods to less than one year. Many of its recommendations were incorporated in the Corporate Governance Code. See also Hampel Report.
