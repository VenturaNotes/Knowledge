- A periodic sequence of symbols generated by a linear feedback shift register whose feedback coefficients form a primitive polynomial. A q-ary register (with $q^{\prime}$ ) whose generating polynomial is of degree $n$ will have period $q^{n}-1$, provided that the initial state is nonzero, and its contents will proceed through all the nonzero $q$-ary $n$ tuples. The termwise modulo-$q$ sum of two m-sequences is another m-sequence: the m-sequences (of a given generating polynomial), together with the zero sequence, form a group.
- The term is short for maximum-length sequence. It is so called because the generating shift register only has $q^{n}$ states, and so such a register (with arbitrary feedback logic) cannot generate a sequence whose period exceeds $q^{n}$. But with linear logic the zero state must stand in a loop of its own (see Good-DE Bruijn diagram) and so the period of a linear feedback register cannot exceed $q^{n}-1$. This period, which can be achieved when and only when the polynomial is primitive, is therefore the maximum that can be achieved.
- m-sequences have many useful properties. They are employed as pseudorandom sequences, error-correcting codes (as they stand, or shortened, or extended), and in determining the time response of linear channels (see CONVOLUTION). See also SIMPLEX CODES.
