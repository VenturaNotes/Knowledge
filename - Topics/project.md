- A set of activities intended to produce a specific output, which has a definite beginning and end. The activities are interrelated and must be brought together in a particular order, based on precedence relationships between the different activities. Examples of projects include the building of the Channel Tunnel and the design of a computer system for an ambulance service. Projects are usually based on bringing together teams of specialists within relatively temporary management structures. Project management techniques are increasingly being used to manage such tasks as the introduction of total quality management within organizations.
