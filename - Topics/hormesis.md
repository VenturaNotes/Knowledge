- $n$. A phenomenon in which a dose-response curve shows low-dose stimulation and high-dose inhibition, as in a drug that has beneficial effects at a low dose and toxic or harmful effects at a higher dose, relative to criteria such as health, stress tolerance, growth, or longevity. An example is alcohol, beneficial at low dosages in preventing heart disease and stroke, but toxic at higher dosages. The phenomenon has controversially been used to lend credibility to homeopathy. The term was introduced by the Master's degree student of forestry Chester M. Southam (1919-2002) and his supervisor John Ehrlich (1907-92) in an article in the journal Phytopathology in 1943. hormetic adj. \[From Greek horme animal impulse + -sis indicating action]
