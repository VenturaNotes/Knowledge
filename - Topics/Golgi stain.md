- $n$. A method of staining neurons with potassium dichromate and silver nitrate, introduced in 1873 by the Italian cytologist Camillo Golgi (1843-1926), affecting only a tiny fraction of the neurons in the stained region but revealing them fully or almost fully, exposing their cell bodies, dendrites, and axons. Compare Nissl stain.
