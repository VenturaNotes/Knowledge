- $n$. inflammation of the urethra. This may be due to gonorrhoea (specific urethritis), another sexually transmitted infection such as infection with Chlamydia trachomatis (nongonococcal urethritis, NGU; or nonspecific urethritis, NSU), or to the presence of a catheter in the urethra. The symptoms are those of urethral discharge with painful or difficult urination (dysuria). Treatment of urethritis due to infection is by administration of appropriate antibiotics after the causative organisms have been isolated from the discharge. Untreated or severe urethritis results in a urethral stricture.
