- A financial instrument that provides insurance against the risk of default on debt instruments such as bonds or mortgage-backed securities. The buyer of the credit default swap pays a premium to the seller, which is usually a hedge fund, and in the event of default is entitled to a lump-sum payment, equal to the value of the debt, from the seller. The higher the perceived risk of the debt, the higher is the required premium.
