- Sales to end users include new products already branded and packaged that are sold to retail outlets and businesses. The products can be new items that have just hit the market, or they can be older items that have been discontinued and need to be cleared out of inventory. In some cases, manufacturers will sell their products to retailers at a discount to get them off of their hands quickly.
