- A computing system, generally web-based, that is used to support teaching. Such systems provide a mechanism for instructors to share teaching materials, lecture slides, exercises, and reference resources. The system enables enrolled students to access these materials and to submit their own work; it may also assist the instructor with grading. Many systems support some kind of chat room or discussion forum facility to enable interaction between teacher and student.
