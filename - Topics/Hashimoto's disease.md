- (Hashimoto's thyroiditis) chronic inflammation of the thyroid gland (thyroiditis) due to the formation of thyroid antibodies. Its features include a firm swelling of the thyroid and partial or total failure of secretion of thyroid hormones; often there are autoantibodies to other organs, such as the stomach. Women are more often affected than men and the condition often occurs in families. \[H. Hashimoto (1881-1934), Japanese surgeon]
