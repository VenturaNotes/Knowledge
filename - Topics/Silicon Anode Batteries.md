- Silicon anode batteries have now replaced Li-ion or lithium-ion batteries that utilized lithium as their anode material. Silicon has more than ten times the amount of energy density compared to graphite anodes and allows for quicker charging rates. It is therefore a desirable material for anode batteries and its use has been widely researched. Silicon does, however, face challenges with its expansion tendency when used in anode batteries. This is the reason silicon anode batteries have not been widely used in commercial applications up until now.
