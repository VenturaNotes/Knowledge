- (RPM) Formerly, an agreement between a manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer not to sell a specified product below a fixed price, usually one given by the manufacturer. The purpose was to ensure that all parties were allowed to make a reasonable profit without cutthroat competition. Such an agreement, however, is not in the public interest as it stifles competition; RPM contracts are now generally prohibited under UK and EU law. See RECOMMENDED RETAIL PRICE.
