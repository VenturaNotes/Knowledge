- (RPM) Formerly, an agreement between a manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer not to sell a specified product below a fixed price, usually one given by the manufacturer. The purpose was to ensure that all parties were allowed to make a reasonable profit without cutthroat competition. Such an agreement, however, is not in the public interest as it stifles competition; RPM contracts are now generally prohibited under UK and EU law. See RECOMMENDED RETAIL PRICE.

- (RPM) The fixing by manufacturers of minimum prices at which their products may be resold by distributors. While RPM does not necessarily imply a price-fixing cartel of producers, it does make such a cartel easier to organize. RPM was stopped in the UK by the Retail Prices Act of 1964 and the Restrictive Practices Act of 1966, with some exceptions, including the Net Book Agreement, until that system collapsed in 1995. Manufacturers can still set a recommended retail price, but cannot legally enforce this.
