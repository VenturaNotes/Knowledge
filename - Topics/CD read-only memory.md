- CD read-only memory, a means of providing read-only access to data for use on computer systems; the term applies to the medium in general (based on the 120 mm diameter audio CD) and to a particular instance.
- A CD-ROM drive must be used with the computer system to read the information from disk. Most drives can also play CD audio disks, but audio disk players cannot handle CDROMs. A standard CD-ROM is capable of holding about 700 Mbytes of data. The first CD-ROM drives moved the disk at the same speed as the audio product, both using CLV, and had a much lower rate-about 150 Kbytes per second-than hard magnetic disks (although higher than floppy disks). Modern drives operate at about 50 times this speed, giving data transfer rates of 7.5 Mbytes per second.
- The data on CD-ROMs is encoded in the form of a spiral of minute pits impressed into one surface of the disk at the time of manufacture, and cannot normally be rewritten (but see CD-R, CD-RW). The data may be in any form-text, sound, static or video images, or binary data, or a mixture (see MULTIMEDIA); various CD-ROM format standards exist to handle these.
- CD-ROM is widely used for the distribution of data, images, and software. Many commercial databases and indexes are available on CD-ROM, often as an alternative to an online service. It has now been almost completely superseded by the DVD as dataset sizes increase.
- CD-ROM was first announced in 1983 and became a mass-market medium in the mid1990s.
