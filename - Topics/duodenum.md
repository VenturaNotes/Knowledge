- $n$. the first of the three parts of the small intestine. It extends from the pylorus of the stomach to the jejunum. The duodenum receives bile from the gall bladder (via the common bile duct) and pancreatic juice from the pancreas. Its wall contains various glands (including Brunner's glands) that secrete an alkaline juice, rich in mucus, that protects the duodenum from the effects of the acidic chyme passing from the stomach. -duodenal adj.
## Source[^2]
- (pl. duodenums or duodena) The first section of the small intestine of vertebrates. It is the site where food from the stomach is subjected to the action of bile (from the bile duct) and pancreatic enzymes (from the pancreatic duct) as well as the enzymes secreted by digestive glands in the duodenum itself (see succus entericus), which are required in the breakdown of proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. By neutralizing the acidic secretions of the stomach, the duodenum provides an alkaline environment necessary for the action of the intestinal enzymes.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The first section of the small intestine, into which the pancreas and gall bladder secrete digestive enzymes. \[Shortened from Latin intestinum duodenum digitorum intestine of twelve fingers' length]
