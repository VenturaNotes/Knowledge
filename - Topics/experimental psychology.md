- $n$. The study of psychological processes such as cognition (including perception, memory, thinking, and language), learning, and skills through controlled experiments. The term was originally applied to any psychological research using experimental methods, but it has acquired specialized connotations, and in practice experimental research in social psychology, for example, is not normally published in the major journals of experimental psychology.
