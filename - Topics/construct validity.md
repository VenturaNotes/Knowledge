- $n$. In psychometrics, the extent to which a test measures a specified construct or hypothetical construct, determined by interpreting the psychological meaning of test scores and testing implications of this interpretation. For example, according to the construct of extraversion proposed by the German-born British psychologist Hans J(Ã¼rgen) Eysenck (1916-97), extraverts form conditioned responses more slowly than introverts; therefore, if a scale designed to measure extraversion is administered to a group of respondents, and high scorers are shown in a conditioning procedure to condition more slowly than low scorers, then these data constitute evidence for the construct validity of the scale relative to Eysenck's concept of extraversion. More specific interpretations of construct validity have been suggested in terms of convergent validity and discriminant validity in relation to the multitrait-multimethod matrix, and in terms of the nomological network.
