- An optical disk format. Developed by a consortium of over 180 companies led by Sony, Blu-ray disks are intended to supersede the DVD both for the distribution of video and for data storage-Blu-ray disks can hold up to 25 Gb on each of up to two layers. Like its rival HD DVD format, it achieves this greater capacity by using a 'blue'(actually, a violet) laser rather than the red laser used for DVDs; the shorter wavelength allows the beam to be focused more precisely and so more data to be packed into a given space. Currently (2008) some high-definition DVDs have been released in Blu-ray format, and computer Blu-ray drives are becoming available. The prospects for Blu-ray were considerably enhanced by the effective demise of HD DVD in early 2008.

- Blu-ray refers to the third generation of compact disc (CD) technology, which was conceived after the creation of audio CDs and digital video discs (or DVDs). The major difference between DVDs and Blu-ray is that this newer optical disc data storage format is better suited for the playback of HD (high definition) videos, and DVDs play videos in standard definition. The process of reading from and writing to a Blu-ray disc is conducted using blue lasers, which is where the technology derives its namesake.
