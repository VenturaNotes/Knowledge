- $n$. A phenomenon, discovered by the German-born US psychologist Hans Wallach (1904-98) and co-workers in 1953, in which a moving two-dimensional shadow cast by a three-dimensional object such as a rod appears three-dimensional when the object is held obliquely and rotated about its center, causing complex transformations that make the shadow appear to move in front and behind the surface on which it is cast. The three-dimensional effect disappears if the rod stops moving, or if it rotates in a plane perpendicular to the surface on which the shadow is cast, causing the shadow merely to lengthen and shorten as the rod rotates. It is closely related to the windmill illusion. See also structure from motion. KDE abbrev.
