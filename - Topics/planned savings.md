- The amount that individuals, firms, or governments plan to save. Savings plans may not be carried out for two main reasons. Income may be larger or smaller than expected, and emergencies may arise which require unanticipated spending or prevent spending plans from being carried out. Planned savings should be distinguished from contractual savings, such as mortgage repayments or life insurance premiums.
