- $n$. preoccupation with the physical functioning of the body and with imagined ill health. In the most severe form there are delusions of ill health, sometimes associated with underlying illness, such as depression. When symptoms reach the level sufficient to be classified as a disorder, it is called illness anxiety disorder (in DSM-5; formerly hypochondriasis) or hypochondriacal disorder (in ICD-10). Treatment with reassurance, antidepressant drugs, and/or psychotherapy is common, but the condition is often chronic. $\textendash$hypochondriac adj., $n$.
## Source[^2]
- n. A somatoform disorder characterized by pathological hypochondria, intense preoccupation and worry about apparently normal somatic sensations or physical signs, which are interpreted as symptoms of a serious illness, in spite of appropriate medical investigation and reassurance that the fear is groundless. In most severe cases the preoccupation can become a hypochondriacal delusional disorder involving a false belief that a disease is present. In DSM-5, this term was replaced by somatic symptom disorder. Also called health anxiety disorder. See also MEDICAL STUDENT SYNDROME.
