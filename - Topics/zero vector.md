## Synthesis
### Description
- A zero vector is a unique vector where all of its components are zero
	- #question What is meant by unique vector?
- $\mathbf{0}$ represents zero vector (bolded to distinguish from scalar 0)
	- #question What does scalar 0 look like? 

### Examples
- In 2D:  $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$
	- #question Are each of the zeros here considered a "component?"
- In 3D: $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$
- In $n$-dimensions: $\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}$
