- $n$. incontinence of faeces. The term is used for faecal soiling in a child who has gained bowel control but passes formed stools in unacceptable places. The underlying problem is behavioural and treatment is difficult, often requiring the input of a child psychiatrist. Encopresis must be distinguished from chronic constipation with overflow.
