- (1630-77) English mathematician whose method of finding tangents, published in 1670 , is essentially that now used in differential calculus. He may have been the first to appreciate that the problems of finding tangents and areas under curves are inversely related. When he resigned his chair at Cambridge, he was succeeded by Newton, on Barrow's recommendation.
