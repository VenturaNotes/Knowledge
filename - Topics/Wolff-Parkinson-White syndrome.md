- a congenital abnormality of heart conduction caused by the presence of an accessory pathway of conduction between the atria and ventricles. It results in premature excitation of one ventricle and is characterized by an abnormal wave (delta wave) at the start of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram. The accessory pathway predisposes the patient to episodes of fast heart rate due to the rapid selfsustaining circulation of an electrical impulse from the atria to the ventricles and back again (atrioventricular reciprocating tachycardia). Emergency treatment is in the form of drugs that temporarily block the re-entry circuit. Permanent destruction of the accessory pathway by radiofrequency ablation is usually curative. \[L. Wolff; Sir J. Parkinson (1885-1976), British physician; P. D. White (1886-1973), US cardiologist]
