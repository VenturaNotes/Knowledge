- A way of representing a molecule as a table showing the atoms, their coordinates, and the links between them. The MDL molfile format uses a connection table in its representation of structure. Connection tables are a useful way of storing molecular data, both from the point of view of graphics programs and also for database searches, in which it is possible to use the table to look for substructures.
