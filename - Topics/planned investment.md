- The amount of investment that firms, individuals, or public bodies intend to make during some period. Actual investment may not correspond to planned investment for various reasons. Fixed investment plans may not be met because the required investment goods or finance cannot be obtained. Investment in stocks may fall short of planned levels because of unforeseen increases in demand, or may exceed planned levels because goods cannot be sold, so that stocks accumulate until production can be cut back.
