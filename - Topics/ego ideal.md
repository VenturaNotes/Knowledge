In psychoanalysis, an internal notion of personal perfection serving as a model to which one strives to conform, derived from the fusion of narcissism and early identification (2) with parents. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced the concept in 1914 in an article 'On Narcissism: An Introduction', where its origins in narcissism were clearly stated: 'What man projects before him as his ideal is the substitute for the lost narcissism of his childhood in which he was his own ideal' (Standard Edition, XIV, pp. 73-102, at p. 94), and he used it in a central role to explain social phenomena in his book Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1921, Standard Edition, XVIII, pp. 69-143). In his later book New Introductory Lectures on Psycho-Analysis (1932/3), he described it as one of the three functions of the superego, the other two being self-observation and conscience (1933, Standard Edition, XXII, pp. 5-182, at p. 66).
