- (putable bond, put bond) A bond with a put option which gives the holder a right to force the payment of the principal by the issuer before the maturity date. Such an option increases flexibility and reduces the risk of losses for the bond holder related to rising interest rates, potential loss of the issuer's ability to repay, or adverse situation in the secondary markets. For this reason retractable bonds will sell at a premium relative to a similar debt security without the put option.
