- $n$. a British voluntary organization providing a telephone service for the suicidal and despairing. Started in 1953 by the Rev. Chad Varah in the cellars of a London church (St Stephen, Walbrook) with one telephone, it now has over 200 branches throughout the country manned by some 22,000 volunteers. It offers a free, nonprofessional, confidential, and (if required) anonymous service at all hours. Samaritans offer little advice, believing that their clients will be helped to make their own decisions by talking to someone who cares.
