- A type of digital counter characterized by a unique sequence of states. The sequence has the effect of 'filling up' the counter with 1 s from left to right, and then 'filling up' with 0 s again. A particularly useful feature is that only one output changes at each clock pulse, making it simple to decode the individual states into single pulses, ensuring that there are no spurious outputs or glitches.
