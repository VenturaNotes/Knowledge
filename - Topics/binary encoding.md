- (1) The representation of symbols in a source alphabet by strings of binary digits, i.e. a binary code. The most commonly occurring source alphabet consists of the set of alphanumeric characters. See CODE. 
- (2) The encoding of a number into a binary string in which the $i$th bit from the end carries weight $2^{i}$. For example, 13 is represented by 1101. This encoding of natural numbers can be extended to cover signed integers and fractions. See also FIXED-POINT NOTATION, FLOATING-POINT NOTATION, RADIX COMPLEMENT. 
- (3) (of a set $A$ ) Any assignment of distinctive bit strings to the elements of A. See also character encoding, Huffman encoding.
