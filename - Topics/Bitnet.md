- (because it's time network) A system established as a message switching network, originally linking IBM mainframe systems located in North America and with backing from IBM. Bitnet operated in a store-and-forward mode, in which each complete message was transmitted from one mainframe system to the next until the destination was reached. Bitnet use declined from the 1990s as the Internet grew and it is now defunct.
