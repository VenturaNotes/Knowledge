## Source [^1]
- A discipline overlapping artificial intelligence and mechanical engineering. It is concerned with building robots: programmable devices consisting of mechanical actuators and sensory organs that are linked to a computer. The mechanical structure might involve manipulators, as in industrial robotics, or might concern the movement of the robot as a vehicle, as in mobile robotics. Robotics research is used in artificial intelligence as a framework for exploring key problems and techniques through a well-defined application.
