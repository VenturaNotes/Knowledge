- A (hyper) surface in a multidimensional state space that partitions the space into different regions. Data lying on one side of a decision surface are defined as belonging to a different class from those lying on the other. Decision surfaces may be created or modified as a result of a learning process and they are frequently used in machine learning, pattern recognition, and classifier systems.
