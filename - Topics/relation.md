- (defined on sets $S_{1}, S_{2}, \ldots S_{n}$ ) A subset $R$ of the $$ Cartesian product

  

$$

S_{1} \times S_{2} \times \ldots \times S_{n}

$$

  

of the $n$ sets $S_{1}, \ldots, S_{n}$. This is called an $n$-ary relation. When a relation $R$ is defined on a single set $S$ the implication is that $R$ is a subset of

  

$$

S \times S \times \ldots \times S(n \text { terms })

$$

  

The most common situation occurs when $n=2$, i.e. $R$ is a subset of $S_{1} \times S_{2}$. Then $R$ is called a binary relation on $S_{1}$ to $S_{2}$ or between $S_{1}$ and $S_{2} . S_{1}$ is the domain of $R$ and $S_{2}$ the codomain of $R$. If the ordered pair $\left(s_{1}, s_{2}\right)$ belongs to the subset $R$, a notation such as

  

$$

s_{1} R s_{2} \text { or } s_{1} \rho s_{2}

$$

  

is usually adopted and it is then possible to talk about the relation $R$ or $\rho$ and to say that $s_{1}$ and $s_{2}$ are related.

  

An example of a binary relation is the usual 'is less than' relation defined on integers, where the subset $R$ consists of ordered pairs such as $(4,5)$; it is however more natural to write $4<5$. Other examples include: 'is equal to' defined on strings, say; 'is the square root of' defined on the nonnegative reals; 'is defined in terms of' defined on the set of subroutines within a particular program; 'is before in the queue' defined on the set of jobs awaiting execution at a particular time.

  

The function is a special kind of relation. Graphs are often used to provide a convenient pictorial representation of a relation.

  

Relations play an important part in theoretical aspects of many areas of computing, including the mathematical foundations of the subject, databases, compiling techniques, and operating systems. See also Equivalence RELATION, Partial ORdering.
