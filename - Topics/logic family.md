## Synthesis

- A range of electronic devices that is made by the same manufacturing technique and provides a number of logic functions. The range includes logic gates, flip-flops, and counters. Families in common use are ECL and TTL, which are based on bipolar transistors, and the NMOS and CMOS families, which are based on MOSFETs.
- Logic families vary as regards switching speed, propagation delay, and power dissipation, although developments in the fabrication technology of the different families often improve these characteristics. A member of a logic family whose output changes state typically within a few nanoseconds ( $10^{-9}$ second) is considered a high-speed logic device. These devices are also characterized by short propagation delays, also in the order of a few nanoseconds. A particular family is characterized by its delay-power product, a figure of merit that is frequently quoted in catalogues. See also LOGIC CIRCUIT.
