Such data are not intended for human interpretation but for treatment by a computer. The term is generally used to describe standards at the application level of the OSI seven-layer reference model.
## Source[^2]
- (EDI) The use of electronic datatransmission networks to move information from one computer system to another, in general without human intervention. For example, EDI can be used for orders, invoices, and payments to suppliers, customers, banks, etc., without recourse to hard copy. EDI is dependent on users having compatible technology and systems that are transparent to the other members of the network.
