- $n$. A type of cell in the primary visual cortex (Area V1) that is similar to a simple cell or a complex cell except that it has an end-stopped receptive field, ceasing to fire if the line, edge, or bar that excites it exceeds a certain length. Hypercomplex cells are sensitive to corners, curvature, or to sudden breaks in straight images. See also bar DETECTOR, EDGE DETECTOR, END-STOPPED RECEPTIVE FIELD, FEATURE DETECTOR, ORIENTATION-SPECIFIC CELL.
