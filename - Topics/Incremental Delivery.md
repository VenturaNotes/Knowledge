## Synthesis
- Functional pieces of software are delivered frequently (as they are tangible) allowing for continuous feedback and adaptation.
	- An example of functional pieces would be when building a login system, incremental delivery might deliver in this order:
		1. Register new user
		2. Log in with existing user
		- And so on. Each part should be complete, working, and deliver a specific, usable capability to the user.
	- There are other types of aspects in [[software development]] aside from functional pieces
