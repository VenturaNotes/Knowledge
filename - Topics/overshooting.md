## Source [^1]
- On financial markets, the tendency for a security, commodity, currency etc. to jump (or fall) suddenly in value and then to drop (or rise) slowly until it finds a new equilibrium. Overshooting has been used as an explanation of exchange-rate movements arising from adjustment problems in economies.
## Source[^2]
- The possibility that after a shock to the economy, some variables will move further in the short run than it is necessary for them to adjust in the long run. This occurs because of differences in speeds of adjustment of different variables. See also EXCHANGE RATE OVERSHOOTING.
