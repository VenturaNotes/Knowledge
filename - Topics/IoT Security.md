- IoT security products are highly specialized to protect devices that connect to the internet but donâ€™t have their own firewalls or built-in security. These security products work specifically to protect networks from cyberattacks that could come via the IoT. IoT is an abbreviation for the internet of things and includes consumer devices that connect to the internet, such as smart thermostats, cameras, watches, sensors on machinery, and many more.
