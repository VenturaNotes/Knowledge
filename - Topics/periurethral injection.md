- the injection of a bulking agent (e.g. collagen) into the tissues around the urethra, used for the treatment of urodynamic stress incontinence. Such injections have a low morbidity and are easy to administer, and results are better in women with good bladder-neck support but poor urethral function. The short-term success rates of these procedures are reasonable, but long-term success rates are poor.
