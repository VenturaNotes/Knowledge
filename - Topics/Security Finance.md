- A security in the finance world is defined as a tradable financial asset, certificate, or instrument that has monetary value and can be traded. There are two types of securities: equity securities and debt securities. Equity securities include stocks, while debt securities include bonds and debentures. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) oversees all securities transactions, including the actions of financial professionals to prevent fraud.
