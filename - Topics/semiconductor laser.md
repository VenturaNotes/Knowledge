- A type of laser in which semiconductors provide the excitation. The laser action results from electrons in the conduction band (see Energy Bands) being stimulated to recombine with holes in the valence band. When this occurs the electrons give up the energy corresponding to the band gap. Materials, such as gallium arsenide, are suitable for this purpose. A junction between p-type and n-type semiconductors can be used with the light passing along the plane of the junction. Mirrors for the laser action are provided by the ends of the crystals. Semiconductor lasers can be as small as 1 mm in length.
