- A term in a contract that restricts a person's right to carry on his or her trade or profession. An example, in a contract covering the sale of a business, would be a clause that attempts to restrict the seller's freedom to set up in competition to the buyer. Such clauses are illegal, unless they can be shown not to be contrary to the public interest.
