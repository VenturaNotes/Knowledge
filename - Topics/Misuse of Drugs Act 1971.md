- (in the UK) an Act of Parliament restricting the use of dangerous drugs. These controlled drugs are divided into three classes: class A drugs (e.g. heroin, morphine and other potent opioid analgesics, cocaine, LSD) cause the most harm when misused; class B drugs include amphetamines, barbiturates, and cannabis, and class C drugs include most benzodiazepines and anabolic steroids. The Act specifies certain requirements for writing prescriptions for these drugs. The Misuse of Drugs (Supply to Addicts) Regulations 1997 and the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001 lay down who may supply controlled drugs and the rules governing their supply, prescription, etc.
