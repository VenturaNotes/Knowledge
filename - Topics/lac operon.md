- The operon that regulates lactose metabolism in the bacterium Escherichia coli. Its form was first postulated in 1961 by Fran√ßois Jacob (1920-2013) and Jacques Monod (1910-76) to explain control of $\beta$-galactosidase synthesis, and it is used as a model for the structure and regulation of genes in prokaryotes. See JACOB-MONOD HYPOTHESIS.
