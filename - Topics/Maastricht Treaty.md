- Legislation, signed in 1992, creating the European Union (EU) from the existing 12 member countries of the European Community (EC). In the main financial provisions of the treaty, the states agreed to a process of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), with the creation of a single European currency as its ultimate goal. Monetary union was designed to be achieved in three stages, starting with participation in the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). The second stage created the European Monetary Institute (EMI) to set qualifying conditions for the move towards the single currency (see CONVERGENCE CRITERIA). The third stage, achieved by January 1999, locked member states into a fixed exchange rate and activated the European Central Bank as the governor of economic and monetary policy throughout the currency union. The euro was fully adopted in 12 EU countries in January 2002. See European Economic and Monetary Union.
