- $n$. a chronic contagious eye disease $\textendash$ a severe form of conjunctivitis $\textendash$ caused by the bacterium Chlamydia trachomatis; it is common in some hot countries. The conjunctiva of the eyelids becomes inflamed, leading to discharge of pus. If untreated, the conjunctiva becomes scarred and shrinks, causing the eyelids to turn inwards so that the eyelashes scratch the cornea (trichiasis); blindness can be a late complication. Treatment with tetracyclines is effective in the early stages of the disease.
