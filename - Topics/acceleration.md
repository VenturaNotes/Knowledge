- Suppose that a particle is moving in a straight line, with a point $O$ on the line taken as origin and one direction taken as positive. Let $x$ be the displacement of the particle at time $t$. The acceleration of the particle is equal to $\ddot x$ or $d^2x/dt^2$, the rate of change of the velocity with respect to $t$. If the velocity is positive (that is, if the particle is moving in the positive direction), the acceleration is positive when the particle is speeding up and negative when it is slowing down. However, if the velocity is negative, a positive acceleration means that the particle is slowing down and a negative acceleration means that it is speeding up.
- In the preceding paragraph, a common convention has been followed, in which the unit vector $\mathbf{i}$ in the positive direction along the line has been suppressed. Acceleration is in fact a vector quantity, and in the 1-dimensional case above it is equal to $\ddot{x} \mathbf{i}$.
- When the motion is in two or three dimensions, vectors are used explicitly. The acceleration a of a particle is a vector equal to the rate of change of the velocity $\mathbf{v}$ with respect to $t$. Thus $\mathbf{a}=\mathrm{d} \mathbf{v} / \mathrm{d} t$. If the particle has position vector $\mathbf{r}$, then $\mathbf{a}=\mathrm{d}^{2} \mathbf{r} / \mathrm{d} t^{2}=\ddot{\mathbf{r}}$. When Cartesian coordinates are used, $\mathbf{r}=x \mathbf{i}+y \mathbf{j}+z \mathbf{k}$, and then $\ddot{\mathbf{r}}=\ddot{x} \mathbf{i}+\ddot{y} \mathbf{j}+\ddot{z} \mathbf{k}$.
- If a particle is traveling in a circle with constant speed, it still has an acceleration because of the changing direction of the velocity. This acceleration is towards the centre of the circle and has magnitude $\frac{v^{2}}{r}$ where $v$ is the speed of the particle and $r$ is the radius of the circle.
- Acceleration has the dimensions $\mathrm{LT}^{-2}$, and the SI unit of measurement is the meter per second per second, abbreviated to $\mathrm{ms}^{-2}$.

- A form of heterochrony in which, during the course of evolution, the rate of development of an organism is speeded up and new stages are added to the end of the ancestral developmental sequence without prolonging the total development time. The morphological outcome is an example of peramorphosis, and the developmental sequence (ontogeny) conforms to the theory of recapitulation.
