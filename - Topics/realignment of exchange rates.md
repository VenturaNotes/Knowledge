- A package of changes in exchange rates, negotiated by agreement between the countries concerned. Under the European Monetary System from 1979 onwards there were a series of realignments. These raised the relative par values of the currencies of countries with low inflation and balance-of-payments surpluses, and lowered the relative parities of countries with high inflation and balance-of-payments problems.
