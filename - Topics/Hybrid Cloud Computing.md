- Hybrid cloud computing involves coordinating and managing IT services using both internal and external cloud services. A hybrid cloud is also sometimes called a cloud hybrid. The term refers to an IT architecture that combines an on-site data center with a public cloud. This allows data and applications to be shared between them. Some hybrid cloud computing services used by SMBs combine on-premises cloud data centers with such cloud services as Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), Google Cloud, Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS), and Oracle Cloud.
