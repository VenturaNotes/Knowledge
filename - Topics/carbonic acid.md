## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A weak acid, $\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$, formed in solution when carbon dioxide is dissolved in water: $$\mathrm{CO}_{2}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{CO}_{3}$$
- The acid is in equilibrium with dissolved carbon dioxide, and also dissociates into hydrogencarbonate and hydrogen ions. These reactions, catalysed by carbonic anhydrase, take place in the red blood cells when carbon dioxide diffuses into them from the surrounding tissue cells. It is a component in a key natural buffer system that maintains the pH of body fluids at a certain level. See also HYDROGENCARBONATE.
