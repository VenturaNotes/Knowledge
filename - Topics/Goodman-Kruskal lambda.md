- $n$. In descriptive statistics, a measure of the degree of similarity between binary or dichotomous variables. It provides an index, on a scale ranging from 0 to 1 , of the presence or absence of a characteristic on one variable given its presence or absence on the other variable. Also called the lambda statistic $L_{B}$. \[Named after the US statisticians Leo A. Goodman (born 1928) and William Henry Kruskal (1919-2005) who discussed it in a series of articles beginning in 1954 and lambda ($\lambda$), the eleventh letter of the Greek alphabet]
