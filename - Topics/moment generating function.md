- The moment generating function of a random variable $X$ is defined as $M_x(t) = E[e^{tx}],t \in \mathbb{R}$ when this expectation exists. When it exists in an open interval around $t = 0$, the mgf can be used to calculate the moments of distribution of $X$ an $m_n = E[X^n] = \frac{d^nM_x(t)}{dt^n}t=0$
