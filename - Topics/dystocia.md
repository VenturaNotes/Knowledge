## Source [^1]
- $n$. difficult birth, caused by abnormalities in the fetus or the mother (see OBSTRUCTED LABOUR). Dystocia may arise due to uterine inertia, which is more common in a first labour; abnormal fetal lie or presentation; absolute or relative cephalopelvic disproportion; or (rarely) a massive fetal tumor, such as a sacrococcygeal teratoma. Synthetic oxytocin (Syntocinon) is commonly used to treat uterine inertia. However, pregnancies complicated by dystocia often end with assisted deliveries, including forceps, ventouse, or (commonly) Caesarean section. See also SHOULDER DYSTOCIA.
