- $n$. the sensation of sounds in the ears, head, or around the head in the absence of an external sound source. It can occur with any form of hearing loss or with normal hearing. It is thought to be due to a misinterpretation of signals in the central auditory pathways of the brain. The signals that are misinterpreted can arise in any part of the auditory system: the cochlea, cochlear nerve, or within the brain itself. Treatment includes the correction of any underlying condition, counselling, cognitive behavioural therapy, mindfulness meditation, acceptance and commitment therapy, relaxation techniques, sound therapy (see White NOISE INSTRUMENT), and use of hearing aids. A unified method of treatment that makes use of several of these components is referred to as tinnitus retraining therapy. See also MUSICAL TINNITUS; PULSATILE TINNITUS.
