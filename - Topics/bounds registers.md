- Two registers whose contents are used to denote an area of memory for which there is access control. The area may be defined by beginning and ending addresses, or by the beginning address and the area length$\textemdash$in which case it is a base-bound register. The use of bounds registers is a form of hardware security, and is sometimes known as boundary protection. See also MEMORY PROTECTION.
