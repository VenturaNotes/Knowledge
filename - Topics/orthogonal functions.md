- Let$$f_{1}(x), f_{2}(x), \ldots, f_{n}(x)$$be a set of functions defined on the interval $(a, b)$; also let $w(x)$ be a given positive function (a weight function) on $(a, b)$. The functions $f_{i}(x)$,$$i=1,2, \ldots, n$$are said to be orthogonal with respect to the interval $(a, b)$ and weight function $w(x)$, if$$\begin{aligned}& \int_{a}^{b} w(x) f_{i}(x) f_{j}(x) \mathrm{d} x=0 \\& i \neq j, \quad i, j=1,2, \ldots, n\end{aligned}$$If, for $i=j$,$$\begin{aligned}& \int_{b}^{a} w(x) f_{i}^{2}(x) \mathrm{d} x=1 \\& i=1,2, \ldots, n\end{aligned}$$then the functions are said to be orthonormal. 
- A similar property is defined when $(a, b)$ is replaced by the set of points$$x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$$and the integral is replaced by a sum,$$\begin{aligned}& \sum_{k=1}^{N} w\left(x_{k}\right) f_{i}\left(x_{k}\right) f_{j}\left(x_{k}\right)=0, \\& i \neq j\end{aligned}$$Orthogonal functions play an important part in the approximation of functions and data.
