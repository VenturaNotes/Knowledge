- $n$. In psychoanalysis, another name for an erogenous zone, specifically the oral, anal, and genital areas of the body. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) first outlined his ideas about erotogenic zones in 1896 and 1897 in letters to his friend, the German physician Wilhelm Fliess (1858-1928), and then published his theory in 1905 in his book Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (Standard Edition, VII, pp. 130-243, at pp. 183-4). By 1938, when he published An Outline of Psycho-Analysis, he had decided that 'in fact the whole body is an erotogenic zone' (Standard Edition, XXIII, pp. 144-207, at p. 151). Also called a primary zone. See also anal erotism, instinctual source, libidinal stage, oral erotism, phallic erotism, urethral erotism. Compare hysterogenic zone. \[From Greek eros love or sexual desire + genes born + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
