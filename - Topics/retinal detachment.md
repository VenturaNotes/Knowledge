- (detached retina) separation of the inner nervous layer of the retina from the outer pigmented layer (retinal pigment epithelium, RPE). It commonly occurs when a break (hole or tear) allows fluid from the vitreous cavity of the eyeball to accumulate under the retina (rhegmatogenous) but can also occur when fluid accumulates by leakage from the RPE (nonrhegmatogenous). Vision is lost in the affected part of the retina. The retina can be reattached by surgical means, such as external plombage or internal vitrectomy, or by creating patches of scar tissue between the retina and the choroid by application of extreme cold (see CRYOSURGERY) or heat (see PHOTOCOAGULATION).
