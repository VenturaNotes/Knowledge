- $n$. a growth found incidentally on (usually) an adrenal gland (adrenal incidentaloma) during CT or MRI scanning of the abdomen or thorax for other clinical reasons. These growths are rarely significant, particularly if small, but they may be pathological if the patient has symptoms (e.g. hypertension, flushing) that could be attributable to an adrenal tumor.
