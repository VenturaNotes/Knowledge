- An (erroneous) structure for benzene proposed by Albert Ladenburg (1842-1911) in 1869, in which the six carbon atoms were arranged at the corners of a triangular prism and linked by single bonds to each other and to the six hydrogen atoms. Although this structure is not the correct structure of benzene, it is the structure of prismane, a molecule which is less stable than benzene.
