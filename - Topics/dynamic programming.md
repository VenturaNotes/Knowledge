- The area of mathematics relating to the study of optimization problems where a stepwise decision-making approach is employ ed. This is often done iteratively.

## Source[^3]
- A method for solving intertemporal optimization problems. Dynamic programming exploits the fact that at any point in time the maximized pay-off for the decision-maker can be written as the maximized value of the sum of current pay-off and discounted value of future pay-offs. See also OPTIMIZATION.

## Source[^4]
- The mathematical theory and planning of multistage decision processes; the term was introduced by Richard Bellman in 1957. It may be regarded as a branch of mathematical programming concerned with optimization of problems formulated as a sequence of decisions. Applications are very varied, including engineering problems and company planning.
