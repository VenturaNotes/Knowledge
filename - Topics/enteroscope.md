- $n$. an illuminated optical instrument (see ENDOSCOPE) used to inspect the interior of the small intestine. The image is transmitted through digital video technology. The examination can be performed using the oral and/or anal approach. The double balloon (push and pull) type, about 280 cm long with a distal balloon combined with an overtube with a proximal balloon, is introduced under direct vision. Double balloon inflation and deflation helps in progression of the endoscope through the small intestine and is the predominant type in current use. The sonde (or push) type, about 280 cm long, has a single inflatable balloon that helps pull the instrument through the length of the intestine using peristalsis. It is now rarely used in clinical practice. The enteroscope is useful in diagnosing the cause of obscure gastrointestinal haemorrhage of the small intestine or of stricture(s). It may also be used to treat bleeding lesions, remove small intestinal polyps, and to obtain tissue samples in suspected cases of malabsorption, inflammation, or intestinal tumors. -enteroscopy $n$.
