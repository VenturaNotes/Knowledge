- $n$. In statistics, an estimate of a population's variance obtained by combining or pooling data from two or more samples. In the independent samples $t$ test, for example, the squared deviations of the scores from their means in both groups are normally pooled to obtain an estimate of what is assumed under the null hypothesis to be the common population variance. Compare SEPARATE VARIANCE ESTIMATES.
