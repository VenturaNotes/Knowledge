- Antagonism towards change among the employees in an organization. The reasons for resistance include a misunderstanding of the goal of the change, having a low tolerance for change (particularly through fear), and perceiving that something of value will be lost. In general, people will only change if they feel it will be in their interests to do so. See also CHANGE AGENT; CHANGE MANAGEMENT.
