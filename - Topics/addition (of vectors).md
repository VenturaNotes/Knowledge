- Given vectors $a$ and $b$, let $\overrightarrow {OA}$ and $\overrightarrow {OB}$ be directed line segments that represent $a$ and $b$, with the same initial point $O$. The sum of $\overrightarrow {OA}$ and $\overrightarrow {OB}$ is the directed line segment $\overrightarrow {OC}$, where $OACB$ is a parallelogram, and the sum $a+b$ is defined to be the vector $c$ represented by $\overrightarrow {OC}$. Alternatively, the sum of vectors $a$ and $b$ can be defined by representing $a$ by a directed line segment $\overrightarrow {OP}$ and $b$ by the $\overrightarrow {PQ}$ where the final point of the first directed line segment is the initial point of the second. Then $a + b$ is the vector represented by $\overrightarrow {OQ}$. Addition of vectors has the following properties, which hold for all $a, b, \text{ and } c$:
	- (i) $a + b = b + a$, the commutative law.
	- (ii) $a + (b+c) = (a+b) + c$, the associative law.
	- (iii) $a + 0 = 0 + a = a$, where $0$ is the zero vector.
	- (iv) $a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$, where $-a$ is the negative of $a$.

- Addition of coordinate vectors in n-dimensional space is done componentwise. So if $a = (a_1, a_2, ...,a_n)$ and $b = (b_1, b_2, ...,b_n),$ then $a+b = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, ..., a_n + b_n).$
