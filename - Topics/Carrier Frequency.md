- In telecommunications, carrier frequency is the frequency (the number of waves per second) of a carrier wave (a wave that carries a signal to convey information). Carrier frequency is measured in Hertz (Hz). For example, a carrier frequency of 10 Hz means that there are 10 carrier waves per second. Carrier frequency is an important concept in radio and television broadcasting. By adding an input signal to the carrier wave, the waveâ€™s frequency can be modulated, encoding this additional information inside the wave. This technique is known as frequency modulation (FM), which gives its name to FM radio.
