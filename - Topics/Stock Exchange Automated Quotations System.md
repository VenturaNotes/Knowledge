- (SEAQ) A computerized system used on the London Stock Exchange to record the prices quoted by market makers. The shares in the FTSE 250 Index are now traded in the Stock Exchange Trading System (SETS) rather than via SEAQ; this means that SEAQ is now mainly used to record prices on the Alternative Investment Market.
