- The branch of robotics concerned with industrial and manufacturing applications. Industrial robots usually take the form of a manipulator arm equipped with an end effector and various sensors. Most commercial industrial robots have very limited sensory capabilities and follow fixed but reprogrammable sequences of operation. Many different programming languages have been adapted or developed for these robots. Current research and development is focused on tasks such as automatic assembly, automatic planning, visual guidance, and error recovery.
