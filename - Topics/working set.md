- The set of pages currently in use by a process. A process running in a virtual memory environment can be regarded as having a subset of its total address space actually in use over any short period of time. The objective of the memory management system is to ensure that for each process those pages, and only those pages, that are actually in use are retained in memory, thus maximizing the hit rate for these pages.
