- $n$. A research design planned in such a way that, in order to control for experimenter effects and the influence of demand characteristics, neither the experimenter nor the research participants or subjects know, until after the data have been collected, which experimental treatment has been applied to which individuals. This type of design is used, for example, in drug trials, often with the use of a placebo (1), to avoid contamination of the results from biases and preconceptions on the part of the experimenter or the subjects. See also RANDOMIZED CONTROLLED TRIAL, RANDOMIZED DOUBLE-BLIND EXPERIMENT. Compare OPEN STUDY, SINGLE-BLIND STUDY.
