- $n$. 
- (1) a membrane, sheath, or other structure that encloses a tissue or organ. For example, the kidney, adrenal gland, and lens of the eye are enclosed within capsules. A joint capsule is the fibrous tissue, including the synovial membrane, that surrounds a freely movable joint. 
- (2) a soluble case, usually made of gelatin, in which certain drugs are administered. 
- (3) the slimy substance that forms a protective layer around certain bacteria, hindering their ingestion by phagocytes. It is usually made of polysaccharide.

- (theca) 
- (1) (in botany) 
	- (a) A dry fruit that releases its seeds when ripe; it is formed from several fused carpels and contains many seeds. The seeds may be dispersed through pores (as in the poppy), through a lid (as in plantain), or by the splitting and separation of the individual carpels (as in the crocus). Various other forms of capsules include the silicula and siliqua. 
	- (b) The part of the sporophyte of mosses and liverworts in which the haploid spores are produced. It is borne on a long stalk (seta) and sheds its spores when mature (see PERISTOME). 
- (2) (in microbiology) A thick relatively rigid gelatinous layer completely surrounding the cell wall of certain bacteria (see GLYCOCALYx). It appears to have a protective function, making ingestion of the bacterial cell by phagocytes more difficult and preventing desiccation. 
- (3) (in animal anatomy) 
	- (a) The membranous or fibrous envelope that surrounds certain organs, e.g. the kidneys, spleen, and lymph nodes. 
	- (b) The ligamentous sheath of connective tissue that surrounds various skeletal joints.
