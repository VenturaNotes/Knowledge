- A branch of mathematics dealing with rates of change (differential calculus) and aggregation of such changes (integral calculus). Its development is usually dated to the work of Newton and Leibniz, though the work of their predecessors such as Gregory and Fermat played an essential role. Especially via the role of differential equations in mathematical modelling, calculus has, since its inception, been the principal quantitative language of science. See also Fundamental Theorem of Calculus.
