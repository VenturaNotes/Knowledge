- (proctodynia) $n$. pain in the rectum or anus. In proctalgia fugax sudden severe pain affects the rectum and may last for seconds to minutes; the pain resolves fully with no ongoing symptoms, and attacks may be days or months apart. There is no structural disease and the pain is probably due to muscle spasm (see IRRITABLE BOWEL SYNDROME). Relief is sometimes obtained from a bowel action, inserting a finger into the rectum, or from a hot bath. It may be prevented by measures used in treating the irritable bowel syndrome.
