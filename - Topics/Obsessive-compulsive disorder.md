- (OCD) a mental illness prevalent in about $1 \%$ of the adult population but more common in children. Males are most commonly affected. The affected person has obsessions or compulsions he or she recognizes as senseless. Resisting the obsession causes anxiety, which is relieved by giving in to the compulsion. The obsession may, for example, be a vivid image, a fear (e.g. of contamination), or an impulse (e.g. to wash the hands repetitively). In severe cases obsessions and rituals can take over many hours of a person's life each day. The condition can be treated with behaviour therapy and antidepressant medication, particularly clomipramine and SSRIs. Psychosurgery is still a rare option in very severe and treatment-resistant cases.
