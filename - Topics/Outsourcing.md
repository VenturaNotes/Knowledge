- The buying in of components, sub-assemblies, finished products, and services from outside suppliers rather than by supplying them internally. A firm may decide to buy in rather than supply internally because it lacks the expertise, investment capital, or physical space required to do so. It may also be able to buy in more cheaply or more quickly than manufacturing in-house. More recently this decision may be taken in the process of business process re-engineering or downsizing, when specific activities have been redefined as noncore activities. In certain instances, computer, legal, and personnel services have been outsourced as well as the more traditional manufactured components.

- The practice of buying goods and services from outside suppliers, rather than producing them within a firm. This is widespread among both firms and government agencies. Outsourcing may be used because specialist outside suppliers can apply more specialized skills, and can benefit from economies of scale or scope not available within the firm that make the product cheaper. It may also be used because adjusting output to variations in demand and maintaining the quality of inputs may be easier via enforcing contracts with outside suppliers than in dealing with a unionized internal workforce.
