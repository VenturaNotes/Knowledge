- $n$. Sexual desire. In psychoanalysis, the energy of the sexual instinct as a component of the Eros. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced the concept in his book Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905), in a passage added to the 1915 edition (Standard Edition, VII, pp. 130-243, at p. 217), and he expanded his explanation in his book Group Psychology and the Analysis of the Ego (1921), where he gave the following definition: 'Libido is an expression taken from the theory of the emotions. We call by that name the energy, regarded as a quantitative magnitude, (though not at present actually measurable), of those instincts which have to do with all that may be comprised under the word "love"" (Standard Edition, XVIII, pp. 69-143, at p. 90). Freud attributed the term to the book Untersuch- ungen Ã¼ber die Libido sexualis (1898, Researches into the Sexual Libido) by the German psychiatrist Albert Moll (1862-1939), but Freud had already used the word several times in letters (Standard Edition, I, pp. 173ff.) to his friend, the German physician Wilhelm Fliess (1858-1928), the earliest occurrence being in June 1894, several years before the publication of Moll's book. See also ego libido, object libido. Compare DESTRUDO, MORTIDO, SELF-PRESERVATION INSTINCT. libidinal adj. Of or relating to the libido. libidinous adj. Lustful, lascivious, or lewd. \[From Latin libido desire or lust]
