- A form of scalable outline font introduced by Adobe Inc. The most common form is the [[Type 1 font]] (a Type 3 PostScript font format also exists but is little used). PostScript fonts are, at present, the main fonts that are used in the printing industry. The outlines are based on BÃ©zier curves, and every weight or style of the font needs two files. On a Windows system, there is a .`pfm` (printer font metrics) file containing the metrics and a .`pfb` (printer font binary) file containing the outlines. Similar files are used on the Macintosh.
- Multiple-master fonts are an extension of the Type 1 format, allowing a user-defined variation in some font property (e.g. font weight).
- See also OpenType font, TrueType font.
