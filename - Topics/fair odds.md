- The odds which would leave anybody betting on a random event with zero expected gain or loss. Thus, if the probability of the occurrence of a random event is $p$ then the fair odds are $(1-p)$ to $p$. If, for example, $p=$ $1 / 3$, then the fair odds are $(1-1 / 3)$ to $1 / 3$, or 2 to 1 . Conversely, if the fair odds for a random event are $a$ to $b$, then the probability of winning is $b /(a+$ b).
