- The extent to which the average fitness (i.e. reproductive success) of all members of a population varies from that of the individual with the greatest fitness. It is denoted by a number from 0 to 1, where 0 denotes that all individuals have genotypes conferring maximum fitness, and 1 indicates that all but one have genotypes conferring zero fitness. In effect genetic load indicates the concentration of deleterious genes within a population.
