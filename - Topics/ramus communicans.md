- (pl. rami communicantes) A structure containing nerve fibers that runs from a spinal nerve to a ganglion of the sympathetic nervous system (see AUTONOMIC NERVOUS SYSTEM). The sympathetic ganglia form a series down each side of the vertebral column; each is connected to the ventral root of a spinal nerve by a pair of rami communicantes.
