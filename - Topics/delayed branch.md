- A conditional branch instruction found in some RISC architectures that include pipelining. The effect is to execute one or more instructions following the conditional branch before the branch is taken. This avoids stalling the pipeline while the branch condition is evaluated, thus keeping the pipeline full and minimizing the effect of conditional branches on processor performance.
