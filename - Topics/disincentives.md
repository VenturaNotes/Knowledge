- Economic arrangements which weaken the inducement to undertake a particular action. For example, a high marginal tax rate provides a disincentive to supply effort, and a low rate of interest provides a disincentive to save. Disincentives can be used to achieve policy objectives: a high tax on tobacco is a disincentive to smoke, and is used to encourage a healthier lifestyle.
