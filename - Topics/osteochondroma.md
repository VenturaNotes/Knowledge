- a bony protuberance covered by a cap of cartilage arising usually from the end of a long bone, most commonly around the knee or shoulder. It is due to overgrowth of cartilage at the edge of the physis (growth plate) of growing bones. The protuberance may be flattened (sessile) or stalklike (see EXOSTOSIS) and usually appears before the age of 30, with patients complaining of either pain or a lump. There is a small incidence (1-2% in solitary lesions, higher if multiple) of malignant transformation of the cartilage cap into a chondrosarcoma. If the lump causes symptoms or continues to grow in an adult, it should be excised.
