- A nonantigenic substance (such as aluminium hydroxide) that, in combination with an antigen, enhances antibody production by inducing an inflammatory response, which leads to a local influx of antibody-forming cells. Adjuvants are used therapeutically in the preparation of vaccines, since they increase the production of antibodies against small quantities of antigen and lengthen the period of antibody production.
