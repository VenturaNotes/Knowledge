## Source [^1]
- A nonantigenic substance (such as aluminium hydroxide) that, in combination with an antigen, enhances antibody production by inducing an inflammatory response, which leads to a local influx of antibody-forming cells. Adjuvants are used therapeutically in the preparation of vaccines, since they increase the production of antibodies against small quantities of antigen and lengthen the period of antibody production.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. any substance used in conjunction with another to enhance its activity. Aluminium salts are used as adjuvants in the preparation of vaccines from the toxins of diphtheria and tetanus: by keeping the toxins in precipitated form, the salts increase the efficacy of the toxins as antigens.
