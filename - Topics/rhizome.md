- A horizontal underground stem. It enables the plant to survive from one growing season to the next and in some species it also serves to propagate the plant vegetatively. It may be thin and wiry, as in couch grass, or fleshy and swollen, as in Iris. Compact upright underground stems, as in rhubarb, strawberry, and primrose, are often called rootstocks.
