## Source[^2]
- External features of a sexually mature animal that, although not directly involved in copulation, are significant in reproductive behavior. The development of such features is controlled by sex hormones (androgens or oestrogens); they may be seasonal (e.g. the antlers of male deer or the body color of male sticklebacks) or permanent (e.g. breasts in women or facial hair in men). In humans they develop during adolescence.
