- A theory of the reactions of molecules that emphasizes the energies and symmetries of frontier orbitals. Frontier orbital theory was developed by the Japanese chemist Kenichi Fukui (1919-98) in the 1950s and is an alternative approach to the Woodward-Hoffmann rules. It has been very successful in explaining such reactions as the Diels-Alder reaction.
