- adj. describing genes (or the characteristics controlled by them) that are carried on the sex chromosomes, usually the X chromosome. The genes for certain disorders, such as haemophilia, are carried on the X chromosome; these genes and disorders are described as X-linked. Since most of these sex-linked genes are recessive, men are more likely to have the diseases since they have only one X chromosome; women can carry the genes but their harmful effects are usually masked by the dominant (normal) alleles on their second X chromosome.
