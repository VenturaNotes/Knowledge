- The programme of the European Community (EC) aimed at unifying its internal market by 1992. The target was the elimination of all barriers to the movement of goods, people, and capital within the EC. This involved the removal of border controls, liberalization of financial markets, harmonization of VAT rates, standardization of industrial regulations, and opening up of government procurement to all EC members.
