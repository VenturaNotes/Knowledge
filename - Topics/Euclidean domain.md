- An integral domain in which a Division Algorithm holds. Specifically, an integral domain R with a function d:R\{0} $\to$ $\mathbb{N}$ such that
	- (i) $d(a) \le d(ab)$ for all $a,b \in R\backslash\{0\}$;
	- (ii) for any $a,b \in R \backslash \{0\}$ there exist $q,r \in R$ such that $a = qb + r$ and $d(r) < d(b)$ or $r = 0.$
- Examples include $\mathbb{Z}$ with $d(n) = |n|$, the Gaussian integers with $d(a+ib) = a^2+b^2$, and polynomials over a field with $d(f)$ being the degree of $f$. Euclidean domains are principal ideal domains (see QUADRATIC FIELD).
