- A model for electrons in a many-electron system in which the correlation between electrons is either ignored or taken into account by regarding an electron as moving in an averaged-out potential that represents the interactions between the electron and all the other particles in the system. Although the independent-particle model cannot describe all aspects of many-electron systems, it had some notable successes, such as explaining the shell structure of electrons in atoms.
