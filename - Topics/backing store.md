- (auxiliary memory, bulk memory, secondary memory) The memory on which information is held for reference but not for direct execution. Backing store is the lower part of the memory hierarchy, in which the speed of access to the information stored is matched to the requirements of the system so as to achieve the greatest economy. The term may be used either in an absolute sense, in which case it usually refers to a disk, or it may be used in a relative sense to refer to the device next down in the memory hierarchy.
