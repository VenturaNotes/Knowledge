- A cipher in which a fixed-length block of data is encrypted, or decrypted, at each iteration of the algorithm: each block is input, encrypted, and output, with no memory (to retain message-dependent information) between blocks (compare STREAM CIPHER). Nevertheless, it is possible to use a block cipher as a component within a more complex system that effects a stream cipher. See also CRYPTOGRAPHY.
