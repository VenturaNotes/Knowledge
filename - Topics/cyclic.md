- Describing a compound that has a ring of atoms in its molecules. In homocyclic compounds, all the atoms in the ring are the same type, e.g. benzene $(C_6H_6)$ and cyclohexane $(C_6H_{12})$. These two examples are also examples of carbocyclic compounds; i.e. the rings are of carbon atoms. If different atoms occur in the ring, as in pyridine $(C_5H_5N)$, the compound is said to be heterocyclic.
