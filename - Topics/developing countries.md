- Countries that often have abundant natural resources but lack the capital and entrepreneurial and technical skills required to develop them. The average income per head and the standard of living in these countries is therefore far below that of the industrial nations.
- The developing countries, in which nearly $80 \%$ of the world's population lives, are characterized by mainly agricultural economies from which poverty, hunger, and disease have not been eliminated. Many depend on a single product for their exports and are therefore vulnerable in world markets. Some have developed small low-technology companies, but market mechanisms (particularly distribution) do not exist.
