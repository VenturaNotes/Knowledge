### Description
- Stated for list of length 2
	- If we have m choices for $1^{st}$ element in a list and for each of the m choices, we have n choices for the second element of the list, the total number of lists is $m\times n$ 
- [[Cardinality]]
	- Given $|A| = m$ and $|B| = n$
		- $|A \times B|$ = $|A||B|$ = $m \times n$

### Examples
- Multiplying Sets
	- Given Sets A, B, the cartesian product is
		- $A \times B$ {(a, b): a $\in$ A and b $\in$ B}
	- Given A = {1, 3, 6}, B = {1, 2},
		- $A \times B$  = $\{(1,1), (1,2), (3,1), (3,2), (6,1), (6,2)\}$
