## Synthesis
- A type of protein that uses chemical energy from ATP hydrolysis to move along the cytoskeleton within a cell
## Source[^1]
- Any of various proteins that perform mechanical work in cells by reversibly changing shape. Major motor proteins are kinesin, which moves vesicles along fibers of the cytoskeleton, and dynein, which causes the bending movements of cilia and flagella. They are powered by energy released by the hydrolysis of ATP.
