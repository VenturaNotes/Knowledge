- An economic model in which quantities are fixed in the short run, and prices adjust faster than quantities. This is contrasted with a fixprice model, in which prices are fixed in the short run, and quantities adjust faster than prices. The real world is a mixture of markets where relative prices adjust faster than quantities, for example the foreign exchange market and stock markets, and markets where quantities adjust faster than relative prices, for example the labor market and markets for industrial products.
