- $n$. an immature red blood cell (erythrocyte). Reticulocytes may be detected and counted by staining living red cells with certain basic dyes that result in the formation of a blue precipitate (reticulum) within the reticulocytes. They normally comprise about $1 \%$ of the total red cells and are increased (reticulocytosis) whenever the rate of red cell production increases.
