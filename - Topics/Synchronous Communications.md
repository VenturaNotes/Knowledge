- Synchronous communications is communication that takes place in real time, as opposed to asynchronous communications, which involve messages sent independently and not always received in the order sent. Synchronous communication allows two or more participants to interact, typically through a chat window or video call. This type of interaction is often preferred for tasks that require collaboration, such as brainstorming or problem-solving.
