- Advertising that is aimed at members of the distribution channel of a product or service rather than at the consumer. It is sometimes advantageous to draw the attention of the trade to a product either in addition to consumer advertising or instead of it (usually because it is much cheaper). For example, book publishers rarely go to the great expense of consumer advertising (say, on TV) but usually advertise a new book in the trade journals seen by booksellers, so that the staff in bookshops are kept advised of forthcoming productions.
