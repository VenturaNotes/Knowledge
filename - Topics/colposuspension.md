- $n$. a surgical procedure for treating stress incontinence in women in which the upper part of the vaginal wall is fixed to the anterior abdominal wall by unabsorbable suture material. It may be performed through an abdominal incision (Burch colposuspension) or using a laparoscope (laparoscopic colposuspension). These techniques have now been largely replaced by other less invasive sling procedures, such as tension-free vaginal tape.
