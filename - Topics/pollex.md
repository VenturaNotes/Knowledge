## Source[^2]
- (pl. pollices) The innermost digit on the forelimb of a tetrapod vertebrate. It contains two phalanges (see PENTADACTYL LIMB) and in humans and higher primates it is the thumb, which is opposable (i.e. capable of facing and touching the other digits) and gives the hand greater manipulating ability. In some mammals a pollex is absent. Compare HALLUX.
