- $n$. An awareness of obstacles without vision, experienced by people who are blindfolded and often highly developed in people who are blind, usually felt as a tactile sensation in the facial area but shown by experiments to be explained by reflected sound waves and mediated entirely by hearing. The French philosopher Denis Diderot (1713-84), in a letter in 1749, first attributed it to the action of nerve endings in the face, but experiments later established that it is due to echolocation. Also called obstacle sense. See also biosonar.
