- $n$. Suspension of critical rationality coupled with calm and unquestioning acceptance of uncertainty and doubt. The term, frequently used in British psychoanalysis to describe an attitude adopted by some analysts, is taken from a letter of the English poet John Keats (1795-1821) to his younger brother Tom, who was dying of consumption: 'Negative Capability, that is, when a man is capable of being in uncertainties, mysteries, doubts, without any irritable reaching after fact or reason' (letter dated 21 December 1817).
