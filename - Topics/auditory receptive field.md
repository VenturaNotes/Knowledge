- $n$. An area of space around the head from which auditory stimuli elicit responses from a specified auditory neuron, the spatial area being the auditory neuron's receptive field. The auditory cortex and midbrain of the barn owl, which is capable of more accurate sound localization than any other species that has been tested, have been found to contain neurons that respond only to sounds in very specific spatial areas. See also RECEPTIVE FIELD.
