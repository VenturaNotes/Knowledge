- (offering price) The price at which a new issue of shares is sold to the public. Once the issue has been made the securities will have a market price, which may be above (at a premium on) or below (at a discount on) the issue price (see also STAG). In an introduction or public issue, the issue price is fixed by the company on the advice of its stockbrokers and bankers; in an issue by tender the issue price is fixed by the highest price that can be obtained for the whole issue; in a placing the issue price is negotiated by the issuing house or broker involved. See also INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING; OFFER FOR SALE.
