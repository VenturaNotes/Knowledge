- $n$. the introduction of a tube into part of the body for the purpose of diagnosis or treatment. Thus gastric intubation may be performed to keep the stomach empty during and after abdominal surgery and to provide feeding and drugs when the patient is unable to swallow. In endotracheal intubation an endotracheal tube is inserted through the mouth into the trachea to maintain an airway in an unconscious or anaesthetized patient. It requires expert knowledge for insertion, using a laryngoscope, and has a small cuff at the far end for inflation inside the trachea. It affords the best level of protection of the airway from vomitus.
