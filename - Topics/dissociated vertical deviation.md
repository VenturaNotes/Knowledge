- (DVD) a condition in which one eye looks upwards when the amount of light entering it is reduced, e.g. when it is covered. The eye returns to its original position when the cover is removed. DVD is an acquired condition chiefly associated with infantile esotropia (convergent strabismus). The deviation is dissociated since there is no movement of the focusing (i.e. uncovered) eye during the deviation or return phase.
