- $n$. An impossible figure of a solid triangular frame that could not exist in actual space although each of its corners, considered on its own, is feasibly constructed (see illustration). Also called an impossible triangle or a tribar. The first recognizable version of it was depicted in 1934 as an impossible arrangement of nine cubes by the Swedish artist Oscar Reutersvärd (1915-2001) and was used as a design for a postage stamp issued in Sweden in 1982. \[Named after the English psychologist/geneticist Lionel S. Penrose (1898-1972) and his mathematical physicist son Roger Penrose (born 1931) who, unaware of Reutersvärd's earlier work, published a version of it in 1958]
