- A marketing strategy that will position a company's products and services against those of its competitors in the minds of consumers. To achieve positioning success it is suggested that there are four basic competitive strategies that a company can follow. The three winning strategies are:
	- cost leadership$\textemdash$the company tries to achieve lowest costs of production and distribution;
	- differentiation$\textemdash$making use of specific marketing mixes (see DIFFERENTIATED MARKETING);
	- focus$\textemdash$paying attention to a few market segments.
- The fourth strategy is a losing strategy in which a company pursues a middle-of-the-road path. Companies that try to be good at everything are rarely particularly good at anything.
