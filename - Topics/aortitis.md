- $n$. inflammation of the aorta, which was previously common as a late complication of syphilis but is more often now associated with a variety of poorly understood autoimmune conditions (such as Beh√ßet's syndrome and Takayasu's disease). Inflammation of the aortic wall may result in the formation of an aneurysm or vascular stenosis, obstructing blood flow to target organs. Chest pain may occur from pressure on surrounding structures or from the reduced blood supply to the heart. Aortic regurgitation may be found. Surgical repair to the aortic aneurysm or valve may be needed.
