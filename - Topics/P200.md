- n. A major positive deflection in an event-related potential or an average evoked potential, occurring about 200 milliseconds after the onset of the stimulus. Some researchers have claimed that its magnitude, or the acuteness of the angle between the N140 and the P200, correlates with IQ, but empirical findings are inconsistent. Compare string length. Also called the P200 potential or P200 wave. \[From p(ositive) 200 (milliseconds)]
