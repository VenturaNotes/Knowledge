- A conjunction is true only when two logical statements are true simultaneously
	- Example:
		- Given A, B are logical statements, $A \land B$ denotes their conjunction

## Source[^2]
- A logical expression of the form

  

$$

a_{1} \wedge a_{2} \wedge \ldots \wedge a_{n}

$$

  

where $\Lambda$ is the AND operation. A particular conjunction of interest is the conjunctive normal form (CNF) of a Boolean expression involving $n$ variables, $x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$. Each $a_{i}$ is of the form

  

$$

\left(y_{1} \vee y_{2} \vee \ldots \vee y_{n}\right)

$$

  

where $\vee$ is the OR operation and $y_{i}$ is equal to $x_{i}$ or the complement of $x_{i}$. Reducing expressions to conjunctive normal form provides a ready method of determining the equivalence of two Boolean expressions. See also PROPOSITIONAL CALCULUS. Compare DISJUNCTION.
## Source[^3]
- n. 
- (1) The act or process of joining together, or the state of being joined. 
- (2) In logic, two propositions (1) connected by an operator denoting and to form a single compound proposition, usually written $p \wedge q$, where $p$ and $q$ represent the component propositions or conjuncts, the compound proposition being true only if both of its conjuncts are true. See also CONJunction fallacy. Compare disJunction (2).
- \[From Latin con- with + iunctio joining + -ion indicating an action, process, or state]
