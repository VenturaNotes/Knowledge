- (dermal bone) Bone formed directly in connective tissue, i.e. by intramembranous ossification, rather than by replacing cartilage (compare CARTILAGE BONE). Some face bones, skull bones, and part of the clavicle are membrane bones. Small areas of membrane become jelly-like and attract calcium salts. Bone-forming cells break down these areas forming a bone lattice, which eventually fills in.
