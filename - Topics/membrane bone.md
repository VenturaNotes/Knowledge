- (dermal bone) Bone formed directly in connective tissue, i.e. by intramembranous ossification, rather than by replacing cartilage (compare CARTILAGE BONE). Some face bones, skull bones, and part of the clavicle are membrane bones. Small areas of membrane become jelly-like and attract calcium salts. Bone-forming cells break down these areas forming a bone lattice, which eventually fills in.

- a bone that develops in connective tissue by direct ossification, without cartilage being formed first. The bones of the face and skull are membrane bones.
