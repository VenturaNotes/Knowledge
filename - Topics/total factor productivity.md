- (TFP) The portion of output that is not explained by measured quantities of inputs into the production process. TFP (also called multi-factor productivity) is usually interpreted as a measure of the level of technology, so an increase in TFP reflects technological advance. For example, if the production function is Cobb-Douglas with output, $Y$, related to capital, $K$, and labour, $L$, by $Y=A K^{\alpha} L^{\beta}$, then $A$ is the value of TFP. The rate of growth of TFP (the growth rate of technology) is measured by the Solow residual, under the assumption of competition in factor markets.
