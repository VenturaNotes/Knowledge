In trigeminal neuralgia (tic douloureux) there are brief paroxysms of searing pain felt in the distribution of one or more branches of the trigeminal nerve in the face. Trigeminal neuralgia is managed principally by prescription of carbamazepine. Migrainous neuralgia is characterized by severe unilateral pain around one eye (see CLUSTER HEADACHE).
