- A solution to an optimization problem that occurs at a point of tangency between two curves. For example, a tangency optimum for a utility-maximizing consumer arises when the highest attainable indifference curve is tangential to the budget line. A tangency optimum can be characterized by equality between the gradients of the curves.
