- (1) n. (leiomyoma, uterine fibroid) a benign tumour of fibrous and muscular tissue, one or more of which may develop within or attached to the outside of the uterus (see illustration overleaf). Fibroids that are large or distort the uterine cavity often cause pain and excessive menstrual bleeding. There may be difficulties with fertility and childbirth. Fibroids are more common in women over 30 years of age and they shrink after the menopause unless the woman is taking HRT. Medical treatment of fibroids includes administration of gonadorelin analogues or more recently ulipristal. Small fibroids can be destroyed by diathermy using a hysteroscope. Larger ones may be coagulated by laparoscopic use of the Nd:YAG laser (laparoscopic myolysis) or removed by myomectomy or uterine artery embolization. Otherwise hysterectomy may be necessary. If discomfort and other symptoms are absent, surgery is not required. 
- (2) adj. resembling or containing fibres.
