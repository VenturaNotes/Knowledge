- (1) Any physical medium that conveys information between remote points. It may, for example, be a telephone line, a coaxial cable, a waveguide, or an optical fibre. See also mULTIPLEXING. 
- (2) Specifically, a transmission system where the length of the medium in terms of the propagation time from source to destination is comparable to the rise time of pulses transmitted. To minimize pulse distortion the transmission line should be terminated in its characteristic impedance.
