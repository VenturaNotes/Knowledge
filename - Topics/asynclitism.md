- $n$. tilting of the fetal skull towards one or other shoulder causing the top of the skull to be either nearer to the sacrum (anterior asynclitism or Naegele's obliquity) or nearer to the pubis (posterior asynclitism or Litzmann's obliquity). These mechanisms enable the fetal head to pass more easily through the maternal pelvis.
