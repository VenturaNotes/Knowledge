- 1. An equivalence relation defined on the integers in the following manner. Let $m$ be some given but fixed positive integer and let $a$ and $b$ be arbitrary integers. Then $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $m$ if and only if $(a-b)$ is divisible by $m$.

  

It is customary to write this as

  

$$

a \equiv b(\text { modulo } m)

$$

  

One of the most important uses of the congruence relation in computing is in generating random integers. A sequence

  

$$

s_{0}, s_{1}, s_{2}, \ldots

$$

  

of integers between 0 and $(m-1)$ inclusive can be generated by the relation

  

$$

s_{n+1} \equiv a s_{n}+c(\text { modulo } m)

$$

  

The values of $a, c$, and $m$ must be suitably chosen. 2. An equivalence relation $R$ (defined on a set $S$ on which a dyadic operation is defined) with the property that whenever

  

$$

\begin{aligned}

& x R u \text { and } y R v \\

& \text { then }\left(x^{} y\right) R\left(u^{} v\right)

\end{aligned}

$$

  

This is often referred to as the substitution property. Congruence relations can be defined for such algebraic structures as certain kinds of algebras, automata, groups, monoids, and for the integers; the latter is the congruence modulo $m$ of def. 1.
