- (Recent) The most recent geological epoch of the Quaternary period, comprising roughly the past 11,700 years since the end of the Pleistocene up to the present. It follows the final glacial of the Pleistocene and thus is sometimes known as the Postglacial epoch. Some geologists consider the Holocene to be an interglacial phase of the Pleistocene that will be followed by another glacial. See also ANTHROPOCENE.
