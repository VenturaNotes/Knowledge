- $n$. a congenital abnormality in which the opening of the urethra is on the underside of the penis: either on the glans penis (glandular hypospadias), at the junction of the glans with the shaft (coronal hypospadias), on the shaft itself (penile hypospadias), or in the perineum (perineal hypospadias). All varieties can be treated surgically, and neither micturition nor sexual function need be impaired. See MAGPI OPERATION.
