## Source[^2]
- Open source is the term used for any computer program that contains source code that is publicly accessible for developers to use how they see fit. Open source licenses are typically more affordable than proprietary licenses, considering most open source code is available to use free of charge. Open source code is typically developed in a decentralized and collaborative manner, relying on the contributions and reviews of a variety of different software developers. According to the U.S. federal appeals courts, all open source licenses must have legally binding requirements for any use of copyrighted material. Open source tools are often used by software developers to troubleshoot their software solutions during the earlier stages of the program development cycle.
