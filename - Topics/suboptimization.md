## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A situation that arises when the individual components of a system fail to work together to achieve maximum synergy. This can result from:
	- the failure of one or more elements to produce their own outputs to a sufficient standard;
	- poor communication of objectives at a strategic level, so that there is no shared understanding of those objectives;
	- poor communication across component boundaries, either through ineffective use of the available tools or through deliberate control and manipulation of information;
	- the development of subcultures that do not share the overall objectives of the organization.
- Most organizations recognize that individual members have a range of personal needs that may not be entirely compatible with the organization's aims. Desired outputs are necessarily a compromise between personal needs and the ideals of an organization. See also GOAL DIVERGENCE.
