- $n$. A scale of measurement in which numbers are assigned so that ratios between values reflect ratios in the attribute being measured, familiar examples being density (mass divided by volume) and fuel efficiency in miles per gallon or kilometres per litre. See also MEASUREMENT LEVEL, SCALE (1). Compare ABSOLUTE SCALE, INTERVAL SCALE, NOMINAL SCALE, ORDINAL SCALE, RATIO SCALE. \[So called because the logarithms of the scale scores form an interval scale, the reason being that the ratio $\log (a / b)=\log a-\log b]$
