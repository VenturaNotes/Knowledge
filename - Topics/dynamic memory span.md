- $n$. The number of items that a person can remember when presented with a continuous sequence of items, such as words, numbers, or letters, the sequence being halted without warning and the person asked to recall as many items as possible, working back from the most recent items. The usual span is only approximately three items, compared to a memory span of approximately seven items when the sequence is confined to that length. See also SHORT-TERM MEMORY.
