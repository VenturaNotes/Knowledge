- pl. n. masses of lymphoid tissue around the pharynx, usually referring to the palatine tonsils on either side of the oropharynx. However, there is more tonsil tissue below the palatine tonsils, on the back of the tongue (the lingual tonsils), and small deposits around the openings of the Eustachian tubes in the nasopharynx (the tubal tonsils). The tonsils are concerned with protection against infection. Together with the adenoids, they form Waldeyer's ring.
