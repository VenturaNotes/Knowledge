- An act that hinders the course of justice or that constitutes disrespect to the lawful authority of the court. Contempt may be divided into acts committed in court (for instance, unseemly behaviour or refusing to answer a question as a witness) and acts committed out of court (such as intimidating a witness or refusing to obey a court order). Contempt of court is punishable by fine or imprisonment or both.
