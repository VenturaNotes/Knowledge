- A 404 status code, otherwise known as a ʻpage not foundʻ error code, is a hypertext transfer protocol that lets a web user know that the webpage they’ve requested is unavailable. When web users attempt to access a webpage that does not exist, has been moved, or contains a broken link, the 404 status code will appear on screen. By using a web analysis tool, such as Google Search Console, website owners can determine if their website contains any links that may result in a 404 status code.
