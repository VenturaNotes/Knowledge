- Anonymous is an international collective of hackers (also referred to as cyber vigilantes) that launch politically-motivated attacks against government-affiliated institutions, corporations, and other types of organizations. This group of cyberhackers assembled on an anonymous internet chatboard called 4chan. 
- Most of their cyberattacks are in the form of distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that use multiple botnets (compromised computer systems) to clog network traffic and prevent users from accessing online services. Anonymous' trademark is to wear Guy Fawkes masks and use voice changers when communicating virtually with the public. 
- This group typically launches their cyberattacks on organizations that, in their opinion, either censor the public, promote inequality, or attempt to get away with injustice.
