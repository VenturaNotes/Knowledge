- narrowing of the outlet of the stomach (pylorus). This causes delay in the passage of stomach contents into the duodenum, leading to recurrent vomiting (sometimes of food eaten more than 24 hours earlier), abdominal distension, dehydration, and weight loss. Pyloric stenosis in adults is caused either by a peptic ulcer adjacent to or within the pylorus or by a tumor invading the pylorus. Stenosis from peptic ulceration may be treated with antisecretory agents, endoscopic balloon dilatation of the pylorus, or by surgical removal or bypass (see GASTROENTEROSTOMY). Surgery is usually required for cancerous obstruction; in unfit patients and those with metastatic disease a stent can be placed to relieve the obstruction. Congenital hypertrophic pyloric stenosis occurs in babies about 3-5 weeks old (particularly boys) in which the thickened pyloric muscle can be felt as a nodule. Treatment is by the surgical operation of pyloromyotomy (Ramstedt's operation).
