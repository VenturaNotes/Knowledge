- (arterial portography) n. an invasive imaging technique used to visualize the portal vein. A diagnostic catheter is advanced to the superior mesenteric artery or splenic artery from the common femoral artery or radial artery. X-ray contrast is injected and images are taken as this passes through the artery and returns via the veins, to opacify the portal vein. The images obtained will show the portal vein on fluoroscopy. When it is combined with CT scanning (CT arterioportography), exquisite details of the portal vein and the liver will be obtained. As the liver is mainly supplied by the portal vein, this technique enhances the contrast of the normal liver and shows any abnormal areas very clearly. Tumours not seen on conventional CT scans are readily visible.
