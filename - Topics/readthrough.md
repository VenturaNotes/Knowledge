- The continuation of transcription of DNA beyond a normal stop signal, or terminator sequence, due to failure of RNA polymerase to recognize the signal. Readthrough can also occur in translation, when a mutation has converted a normal stop codon into one encoding an amino acid. This results in extension of the polypeptide chain until the next stop codon is reached, producing a so-called readthrough protein.
