- $n$. a drug used in the treatment of high blood pressure (hypertension) and heart failure. It inhibits the action of angiotensin (see ACE inhibitor), which results in decreased vasopressor (blood-vessel constricting) activity and decreased aldosterone secretion. Side-effects can include a persistent dry cough, a drastic fall in blood pressure, headache, dizziness, fatigue, and diarrhoea.
