- (1) A marketing strategy in which a special introductory offer is used to persuade consumers to sign up to a longer-term obligation that entails regular payments. Those who join such schemes, which typically include subscription services, book clubs, and gym memberships, may find that rules about e.g. notice periods make it more difficult to withdraw than they had supposed. 
- (2) In Internet sales, a dark pattern on a website that operates so that a consumer who enters his or her bank details (either to make a payment or to enjoy a 'free trial') is subsequently charged on a recurring basis, usually without having given explicit authorization. The charges may be small and irregular in the hope that the consumer will not notice them.
