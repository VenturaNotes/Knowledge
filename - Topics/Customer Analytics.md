- Customer analytics is a process where customer data is collected and examined to identify, attract, and retain customers. In most cases, this involves the use of customer analytics software, which streamlines the process of analyzing data and allows a business to understand how customers interact with their product or service. In turn, businesses can make better decisions regarding matters such as pricing, features and what factors cause customers to stop engaging.
