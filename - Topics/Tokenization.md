- Tokenization is a process used in data security that transforms valuable data into a random assortment of characters known as a token. In a data breach, these tokens have no value to cybercriminals. Businesses can access this information after it is transformed into a token through a tokenization system. These systems can also detokenize data, so it is once again accessible. However, specific authorizations are required to do so, which ensures the data remains safe.
