- Diversity and inclusion, or D&I, refers to the programs, policies, and processes that support diverse groups of people working in an organization. It promotes equal representation for people of different races, religions, genders, and sexual orientations. Human resources (HR) is typically responsible for D&I; however, managers might hire outside companies to implement DEI training and policies.
