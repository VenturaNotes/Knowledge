- (benign intracranial hypertension, pseudotumour cerebri) a syndrome of raised pressure within the skull in the absence of a clear structural cause, such as a tumor. Although the cause is not certain, proposed mechanisms include impaired reabsorption of cerebrospinal fluid or venous outflow from the brain. The symptoms include headache, vomiting, double vision, and papilloedema. The diagnosis is made by finding a high opening pressure at lumbar puncture in the absence of a causative structural abnormality on brain imaging. It can improve spontaneously but drug therapy or neurosurgical treatment may be required to protect the patient's vision.
