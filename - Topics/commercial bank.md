- A bank that provides a wide range of financial services, both to the general public and to firms. The principal activities are operating current accounts, receiving deposits, taking in and paying out notes and coin, and making loans. Additional services include trustee and executor facilities, the supply of foreign currency, the purchase and sale of securities, insurance, a credit-card system, and personal pensions. They also compete with the merchant banks by providing venture capital and trading on the financial markets and with building societies by providing mortgages.
- The main banks with national networks of branches in the UK are the so-called Big Four (the Royal Bank of Scotland group, including NatWest; Barclays, including Woolwich; Lloyds, including HBOS; and HSBC), together with the Spanish-owned Santander Group, which includes the former building societies Abbey and Alliance and Leicester. These are also known as high-street banks, or retail banks.
