- A technique used primarily in microprocessing whereby peripheral devices are interfaced to a processor whose architecture supports input and output instructions. An I/O mapped device is assigned one or more of the processor's I/O port addresses, and data and status information are transferred between the processor and the peripheral device using the processor's input and output instructions.
