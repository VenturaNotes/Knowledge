- An approach to business that places the maximization of the value of shares to those who hold them above other business objectives. Normally, shareholder value can be increased in three ways: dividend payments, appreciation in the value of the shares, and cash repayments. However, this focus has been widened by companies buying back shares to increase earnings and the demerging of parts of a group in order to unlock the value of individual components by means of a separate flotation. Shareholder value can also be influenced by maximizing economic value, either by undertaking positive present-value decisions or by running the business in such a way as to create a surplus above the market costs of funding. The shareholder-value objective has sometimes been criticized as being too narrow and contrary to the longer-term interests of other stakeholder groups.
