- $n$. a horny overgrowth of the skin. Actinic (or solar) keratoses are red spots with a scaly surface, found in older fair-skinned people who have been chronically overexposed to the sun. They may occasionally become a squamous cell carcinoma. Seborrhoeic keratoses (also known as seborrhoeic warts) never become malignant. They are superficial yellowish or brown spots, crusty or greasy-looking, occurring especially on the trunk in middle age, that become warty over the years.
