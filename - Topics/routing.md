- The procedure used to determine the route taken by a packet in a packet switching computer network. Routing may be fixed (computed once at system starting or session initiation) or dynamic (recomputed periodically or on a packet-by-packet basis). Routing may be centralized or distributed (computed by different nodes independently).
