- $n$. A grouping law formulated in 1990 by the US psychologist Stephen E. Palmer (born 1948) to explain the organization of parts into wholes by the visual system. According to the law, elements that are located within the same perceived region tend to be grouped perceptually, so that the array$$[\mathrm{OO}][\mathrm{OO}][\mathrm{OO}][\mathrm{OO}]$$tends to be perceived as being composed of four pairs rather than eight separate elements. Also called the enclosure grouping law. See also Pr√§gnanz. Compare Closure Grouping law, COMMON fate, CONNECTEDNESS GROUPING LAW, GOOD CONTINUATION, PROXIMITY GROUPING LAW, SIMILARITY GROUPING LAW.
