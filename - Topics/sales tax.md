- (expenditure tax; outlay tax) A tax based on the selling price of goods. Such taxes are not now generally favored, since they have a cascade effect, i.e. if goods are sold on from one trader to another the amount of sales tax borne by the ultimate buyer becomes too great. Value added tax was largely designed to meet this objection.

- A tax on the sales of a business. A sales tax is normally a fixed percentage of total sales of some classes of goods and services. Sales taxes are used to raise revenue, for example, by some states of the US. While in principle a value-added tax is better for economic efficiency, a sales tax is simpler to administer when much of the business being taxed is done by firms whose business spreads over several states.
