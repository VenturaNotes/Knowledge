- (expenditure tax; outlay tax) A tax based on the selling price of goods. Such taxes are not now generally favored, since they have a cascade effect, i.e. if goods are sold on from one trader to another the amount of sales tax borne by the ultimate buyer becomes too great. Value added tax was largely designed to meet this objection.
