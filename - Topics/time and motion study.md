- A method of finding the best way of performing a complex task by breaking the task into small steps and measuring the time taken to perform each step. This enables standards of performance to be set. These standards can then be used to plan and control production, estimate prices and delivery times, and devise incentive schemes. Time and motion studies are associated with the school of scientific management.
