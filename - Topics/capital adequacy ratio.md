- (solvency ratio) The proportion of a bank's total risk-adjusted assets that is held in the form of shareholders' equity and certain other defined classes of capital. It is a measure of the bank's ability to meet the claims of its depositors and other creditors in the face of unexpected losses. The minimum international requirement was $8 \%$ but this will rise to $10.5-13 \%$ under the current Basle III proposals (see BASLE Accords).
