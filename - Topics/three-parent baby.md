- A "three-parent baby" refers to a child conceived through a specialized form of [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) that involves genetic material from three different people. 
- The technique is known as [[mitochondrial replacement therapy]] (MRT). It's primarily used to prevent the transmission of [[mitochondrial diseases]], which are genetic disorders passed down through the [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]], the energy-producing structures in cells. It works this way:
	- Maternal Nuclear DNA: The mother's egg provides the [[nuclear DNA]], which includes the vast majority of genes that determine traits like eye color, height, and personality
	- Donor Mitochondria: A healthy egg from a donor, whose mitochondria don't carry the disease-causing mutations, is used. The nucleus from this donor egg is removed, leaving behind only the healthy mitochondria
	- Combination and Fertilization: The nucleus from the mother's egg is transferred into the donor egg with healthy mitochondria, and this egg is then fertilized with the father's sperm
- Since mitochondria have their own small amount of DNA (less than 1% of total DNA), the resulting embryo technically has genetic contributions from three people: the mother, the father, and the donor of the mitochondria. This technique is primarily used to prevent children from inheriting serious mitochondrial disorders, ensuring they receive healthy mitochondria.
