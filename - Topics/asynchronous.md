- Involving or requiring a form of computer control timing protocol in which a specific operation is begun upon receipt of an indication (signal) that the preceding operation has been completed, and which indicates to a subsequent operation when it may begin. The rate at which operations proceed is determined by the time required by individual operations. See also INTERRUPT, GLITCH. Compare SYNCHRONOUS.
