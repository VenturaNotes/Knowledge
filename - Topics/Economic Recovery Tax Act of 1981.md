- US legislation enacted in 1981 ‘to encourage economic growth through reductions in individual income tax rates, the expensing of depreciable property, incentives for small businesses, and incentives for savings, and for other purpose’. The act is credited with a major reduction in tax rates, but the revenue and growth effects are disputed.
