- (EMS) A relatively easy, low cost, and fast method of conducting marketing surveys in which potential respondents are sent the questionnaire by group mail. Respondents e-mail the completed questionnaires back to the researchers. Evidence suggests that e-mail surveys produce a faster but lower response rate than mail (postal) surveys.
