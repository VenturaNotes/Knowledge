- (1) a device used to produce and maintain a normal heart rate in patients who have bradycardia. The unit consists of a battery that stimulates the heart through one or more insulated electrode wires (leads) attached to the surface of the ventricle (epicardial pacemaker) or lying in contact with the lining of the heart (endocardial pacemaker). The pacemaker senses when the natural heart rate falls below a predetermined value and then stimulates the heart (demand pacemaker). A pacemaker may be used as a temporary measure with an external battery or it may be permanent, when the whole apparatus is surgically implanted under the skin. In most cases the right atrium and right ventricle are paced (dualchamber pacing), but in a proportion of patients only right ventricular (single-chamber) pacing is required. 
- (2) the part of the heart that regulates the rate at which it beats: the sinoatrial node.
