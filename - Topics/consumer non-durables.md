- Non-durable goods, such as food, drink, or tobacco, designed for use by final consumers. Some of these are in fact purchased by businesses, for example food for works canteens. Nondurables are not the same as perishable goods. Some non-durables such as wine actually have quite long shelf lives: they are non-durable in the sense that they can only be used once when they are finally consumed.
