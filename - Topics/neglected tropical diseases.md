- (NTDs) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO), a diverse group of communicable diseases found almost entirely among poor populations in tropical and subtropical parts of Africa, Asia, and the Americas. Although they affect more than 1.4 billion people, and countermeasures would in many cases be inexpensive, NTDs have traditionally received far less attention than the major infectious diseases HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria. In 2013 the WHO resolved to intensify its efforts to eradicate or control NTDs. The current WHO list identifies 24 such diseases, including Buruli ulcer, chikungunya fever, dengue, leishmaniasis, and Madura foot (mycetoma).
