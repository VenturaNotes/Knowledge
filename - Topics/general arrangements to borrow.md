- (GAB) The special arrangements made by the Group of Ten (G10) to enable the International Monetary Fund to increase its lending to members of G10. They came into effect in 1962 and were augmented in 1983 when Switzerland, though not a member of the IMF, joined the GAB, enabling it to extend its loan facilities to non-members.
