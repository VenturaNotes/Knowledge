- A form of structured security backed by a portfolio of secured or unsecured bonds or loans. CDOs are placed into different risk classes, or tranches, with the most senior class being the least risky. Interest and principal payments are met using income from the underlying bonds or loans and are made in order of seniority, so the most junior class of CDO have the highest risk of default. CDOs were at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis, at least partly, it has been argued, because credit rating agencies underestimated the risk involved.
## Source[^2]
- (CDO) A structured finance instrument consisting of a bond or note backed by a pool of fixed-income assets. Rights to the cash flows from this pool, along with different levels of credit risk, are allocated to different classes (tranches) of note. Some specific types of CDO include collateralized bond obligations (CBOs), collateralized loan obligations (CLOs), and collateralized mortgage obligations (CMOs). A structured investment vehicle is a specialized form of CDO. The collapse in the value of CDOs backed by subprime mortgage loans was a major factor in the financial crisis of 2007-08 ; such instruments effectively became toxic assets with no market.
