- A general procedure for partitioning the overall variability in a set of data into components due to specified causes and random variation. It involves calculating such quantities as the 'between-groups sum of squares' and the 'residual sum of squares' and dividing by the degrees of freedom to give so-called 'mean squares'. The results are usually presented in an ANOVA table, the name being derived from the opening letters of the words 'analysis of variance'. Such a table provides a concise summary from which the influence of the explanatory variables can be estimated and hypotheses can be tested, usually by means of F-tests

## Source[^2]
- A statistical technique based on decomposing the total variance of some characteristic of a population into parts correlated with other characteristics, and residual variation. In particular, analysis of variance is used to test whether sections of a population appear to differ significantly in some property. For example, if $y_i$ is the personal income of individual $i$, analysis of variance can be used to test whether there are significant regional differences in mean income. The total variance of the population is decomposed into the part due to differences within regions, and the part due to differences between regional means. The larger the proportion of total variance due to differences between group means, the more likely it is that the groups are systematically different, whereas the higher the proportion of total variance due to within-group variance, the more likely it is that apparent differences between group means arise from sampling error.
