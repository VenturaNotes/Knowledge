- (1) The disclosure in the annual accounts and report of certain results of major business, and geographic segments of a diversified group of companies. The argument for segmental reporting is that the disclosure of profitability, risk, and growth prospects for individual segments of a business will be of use to investors. Under International Financial Reporting Standard 8, Operating Segments, listed companies should disclose, for both business segments and geographic segments, total assets and liabilities, profit or loss before tax, and revenue and investment information. Entities should also disclose how segments are defined and how transactions between segments are measured. 
- (2) The approach in management accounting in which the financial and quantitative performance of each definitive part of an organization is reported to the management both of the business segment and of the organization as a whole.
