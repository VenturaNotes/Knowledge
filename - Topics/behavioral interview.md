## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Your responses to behavioral interview questions should seem more natural than memorized
	- Want candidates to think on their feet and provide real-life examples to support their answers
- You should be as specific as possible when answering questions
	- Providing specific examples demonstrates your ability to effectively communicate and provide evidence of your skills and qualifications
- STAR stands for situation, task, action and result
	- This framework is commonly used in job interviews and performance evaluations to structure and assess responses
- When asked a question, should give specific, detailed answers
	- This provides concrete examples and showcases your skills and experiences effectively
- If limited work experience, use internships and sports participation, community service and hobbies
	- Demonstrates ability to work in a team, handle responsibilities, and show dedication and commitment
- According to the theory of behavioral interviewing, a person's past performance is a reliable predictor of future success
	- #question Is there a theory of behavioral interviewing? 
	- Behavioral interviewing focuses on gathering specific examples of a candidate's past behavior to assess their skills, abilities, and potential for success in similar situations in the future
- To prepare for behavioral interview, research the company, position, and possible interview questions
	- Best to understand values, culture, and goals of company.
	- Will help align one's answers with company's expectations
- Not a behavioral interview question: What are your strengths and weaknesses?
	- More of a question about the candidate's self-perception and awareness
	- Not behavioral question because does not ask for specific examples or behaviors from candidate's past experiences
- Succeeding in a behavioral job interview requires preparation (not just showing up with a good attitude)
- Some believe behavioral interviews more effective than other types of interviews because past behavior is a good predictor of future behavior
	- This belief is based on assuming people's past actions and choices can provide insights into future actions and choices
- Use "I" language in behavioral interview
	- Focus on your own experiences, actions, and accomplishments
	- Don't use "we" language or speak in general terms
- KSAO stands for knowledge, Skills, abilities and other characteristics
	- Used in the field of human resources and organizational psychology to refer to the various attributes and qualities that individuals posses and bring to a job or role
		- #question What is organizational psychology?
- Do not begin answering a behavioral interview question as "I think the best thing to do is..."
	- It's a vague and general statement (no specific examples or experiences)
	- Behavioral interviews questions are designed to assess a candidate's past behavior and experiences (important to provide specific examples and anecdotes to support your answers)
	- So "When I worked at McDonald's, I", "At my previous place of employment", ad "That reminds me of when I worked as a bank teller at Chase Bank", etc. are all good. 
- When prepping for a behavioral interview, participate in a mock interview, review the job description, and research the organization
	- Reviewing the job offer is not something to do when preparing for behavioral interview
		- This just includes salary, benefits, and other terms of employment but doesn't provide specific details about job requirements, skills, or behavioral competencies that the interviewer will assess during the interview
- According to theory of behavioral interviewing, best predictor of future success is past performance. 
	- Past performance reflects individual's actual accomplishments and abilities in previous roles
	- Provides valuable insight into their potential for success in future positions
- Behavioral interview is more probing, specific, and pointed than traditional interview questions
	- Behavioral interview questions designed to elicit specific examples of past behavior to predict future behavior.
	- Intended to probe deeper into a candidate's experiences and actions, rather than just asking general questions
- Tell me about a challenge you faced in your last position is a great behavioral interview question
- 85% of employers use behavioral interviews
	- Use it to assess candidates' past behavior and how it may predict future performance

### Tips for Success
- (1) Understand STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Result) for structuring responses. Provides clear and concise answers and keeps your answers focused
- (2) Listen Attentively: Make sure responses directly address what is being asked (from the questions and follow-up prompts)
- (3) Be concise: Keep answers short and to the point (not off-topic)
- (4) Ask Clarifying Questions: It's okay to ask clarification for what the interviewer is looking for. You can also say that you need to collect your thoughts
- (5) Avoid Negative language: Don't speak negative of past employers, colleagues, or experiences
- (6) Stay professional and constructive: Don't be disrespectful, offensive, arrogant, mean or confrontational
- (7) Highlight strengths: Fram responses in a positive light. Even when discussing challenges or failures, say what you learned and how you improved
- (8) Ask thoughtful questions: Since interviewing is a two-way street, ask questions about company, culture, etc. 
- (9) It's okay to not have answer to every question: If you can't recall a question from past experiences, you can say "I think I don't actually have this experience but I would love to tell you how I would react in this situation"
- (10) Highlight you're a team player: Highlight your qualities, ability to work in a team, and help others. Include stories reflecting your qualities and team work
- (11) Be Honest: If don't know answer to question, admit that than make something up
- (12) Prepare ahead of time: Will help you remember things more easily and frame answers better
- (13) Practice common questions: Go through common interview questions and how you'd answer them
### STAR Framework
- Structured method for answering questions effectively
- Situation (S): 
	- Description
		- Describe specific situation with adequate background information for scenario to be understood
	- Example
		- In previous role as software engineer at XYZ Company, worked on project to improve performance of e-commerce platform
- Task (T):
	- Description
		- Explain task/challenged faced and goals/objectives needed to achieve this
	- Example
		- Reduce page load times and increase overall responsiveness of website to enhance user experience 
			- #comment Task is to reduce page load times. Goal of this is to increase overall responsiveness of website (as stated improve performance for situation)
- Action (A): Describe action you took to address task while being specific about steps taken, responsibilities and thought process. Most crucial part of response and focus on your actions (not team's actions)
	- (1) Conducted performance analysis to identify bottlenecks in code
	- (2) Collaborated with front-end and back-end teams to implement code optimizations
		- Browser caching
		- Image compression
		- Code minification
			- #question What is this?
		- (3) Introduced lazy loading for non-essential content
- Result (R): Share results or outcome of action quantitatively if possible and impact of actions on situation
	- Achieved 30% reduction in page load times, 20% improvement in overall website performance. 15% increase in user engagement as measured by longer session durations and higher conversion rates
		- #question What is meant by conversion rates here? 
- #comment Quick Summary
	- I wanted to improve performance of an e-commerce platform (S) by reducing load times (task) to increase overall responsiveness (goal) (T). So I did performance analysis, implemented code optimizations such as browser caching, image compression and lazy loading for non-essential content (A). This all achieved a 30% reduction in page load times, 20% improvement in website performance (improvements) and ultimately a 15% increase in user engagement (user impact). (R)
