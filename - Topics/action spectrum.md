- A graphical plot of the efficiency of electromagnetic radiation in producing a photochemical reaction against the wavelength of the radiation used. For example, the action spectrum for photosynthesis using light shows a peak in the region 670-700 nm . This corresponds to a maximum absorption in the absorption spectrum of chlorophylls in this region.
