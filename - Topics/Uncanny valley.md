- ‘Uncanny valley’ is a term coined by Masahiro Mori, a former professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology. The uncanny valley theory describes the phenomenon in which humans feel a sense of uneasiness the more realistic humanoid robots become. In this assertion, Mori states that robots can be appealing to humans but only to a certain extent. Once a humanoid robot becomes too life-like, humans begin to feel a sense of discomfort.
