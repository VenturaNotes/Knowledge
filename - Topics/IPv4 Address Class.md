- The IPv4 (internet protocol version 4) address class is the fourth version of internet protocol (a compilation of rules for internet communications). IPv4 is a system used to identify each computer or computerized device on the internet. Each computerized device that is capable of accessing the internet is assigned a unique IPv4 address. There are about 4.3 billion IPv4 addresses available today. IPv4 internet protocol (IP) addresses are 32-bit integers that are expressed in decimal form. For instance, “839.0.2.245” is an example of an IPv4 address in the IPv4 address class. Each computerized device a business has in their possession is assigned a unique IPv4 address.
