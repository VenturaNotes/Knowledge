- (IPO) The first sale of shares by a private limited company to the public. It can be difficult to set an issue price that will be low enough to attract sufficient investors to take up the whole issue and yet high enough to give the company the maximum capital. An IPO is underpriced if the issue price is less than the market price and overpriced if the issue price is greater than the market price. See FLOTATION; OFFER FOR SALE; PUBLIC ISSUE.
