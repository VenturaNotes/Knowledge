- A golden parachute is an agreement made between high-ranking executives and the companies that employ them. Usually, these arrangements state that the executive will receive certain compensation (e.g., severance pay, bonuses, retirement benefits, or stock options) if the executive's job is terminated or when they leave the company. The use of golden parachutes is controversial; it can help attract top candidates but also unfairly reward individuals who resign or are fired due to scandals/negative behavior.

- A clause in an employment contract, usually of a senior executive, that provides for financial and other benefits if this person is sacked or decides to leave as the result of a takeover or change of ownership.
