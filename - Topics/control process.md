- A process that helps an organization to determine whether or not its objectives are being achieved and whether or not adjustments need to be made to meet them. A good control system should help managers to determine why goals and objectives are not being met; knowing the cause of failure will help to decide the corrective actions. Control activities should relate directly to tactical and operational plans; in turn, these will affect and influence the organization's long-term strategic plans.
