- a device to measure and record the fluorescent flashes in a scintillator exposed to high-energy radiation.
## Source[^2]
- A type of particle or radiation counter that makes use of the flash of light (scintillation) emitted by an excited atom falling back to its ground state after having been excited by a passing photon or particle. The scintillating medium is usually either solid or liquid and is used in connection with a photomultiplier, which produces a pulse of current for each scintillation. The pulses are counted to enable the radioactivity of the source to be calculated. The distribution of a radiolabelled compound, such as a drug, in an organism can be determined in this way by testing tissue samples from different organs after drug administration.
