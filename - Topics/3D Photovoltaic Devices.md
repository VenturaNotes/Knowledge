- 3D photovoltaic (PV) devices are solar cells that use a 3D structure to convert sunlight into electricity more effectively than conventional 2D solar cells. Their 3D design improves photoelectric efficiency by capturing a larger amount of light within the PV cell or panel. Once a 3D PV cell captures sunlight, the lightâ€™s photons repeatedly bounce around until they are converted into electrons that can be used for electricity. The concept of 3D photovoltaic devices was first developed at Georgia Tech Research Institute and explored by companies such as Solar3D, Inc.
