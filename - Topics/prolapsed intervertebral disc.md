- (PID) a 'slipped disc': protrusion of the pulpy inner material of an intervertebral disc through a tear in the fibrous outer coat, causing pressure on adjoining nerve roots, ligaments, etc. The condition often results from sudden twisting or bending of the backbone or lifting. Pressure on the sciatic nerve root causes sciatica, and if severe may damage the nerve's function, leading to abnormalities or loss of sensation, muscle weakness, or loss of tendon reflexes. 70-80% of patients improve with conservative treatment of rest and analgesics, and traction may help. If these fail, the protruding portion of the disc is surgically removed (see DISCECTOMY; LAMINECTOMY; MICRODISCECTOMY).
