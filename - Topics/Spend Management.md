- Spend management involves several practices that aim to ensure that procurement and sourcing decisions are in line with other business needs and goals. The overall goal of spend management is to account for every cent that has been spent and then use this information to make sure that the company is being as efficient as possible with its spending and its partnerships. In turn, this intense analysis aims to optimize relationships with suppliers while allowing businesses to remain in control of their finances and maximize their ROI, or return on investment.
