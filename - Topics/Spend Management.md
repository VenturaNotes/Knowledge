- Spend management involves several practices that aim to ensure that procurement and sourcing decisions are in line with other business needs and goals. The overall goal of spend management is to account for every cent that has been spent and then use this information to make sure that the company is being as efficient as possible with its spending and its partnerships. In turn, this intense analysis aims to optimize relationships with suppliers while allowing businesses to remain in control of their finances and maximize their ROI, or return on investment.

- A systematic attempt to optimize a company's spending by achieving best value for money in every area of its expenditure. This is to be distinguished from simple cost cutting, which often achieves only short-term benefits. Spend management begins with an analysis of current spending behavior and develops a strategic approach integrating such areas as sourcing, procurement, contract management, supply-chain logistics, and a company's invoicing and payment processes. Specialized software is now available.
