## Source [^1]
- $n$. either of two peptides: angiotensin I or angiotensin II. Angiotensin I is derived, by the action of the enzyme renin, from a protein (alpha globulin) secreted by the liver into the bloodstream. As blood passes through the lungs, another enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), acts on angiotensin I to form angiotensin II. This peptide causes constriction of blood vessels and stimulates the release of the hormones vasopressin and aldosterone, which increase blood pressure. See also ACE inhibitor; ANGIOTENSIN II ANTAGONIST.
