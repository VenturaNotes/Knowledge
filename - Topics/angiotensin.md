## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. either of two peptides: angiotensin I or angiotensin II. Angiotensin I is derived, by the action of the enzyme renin, from a protein (alpha globulin) secreted by the liver into the bloodstream. As blood passes through the lungs, another enzyme, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), acts on angiotensin I to form angiotensin II. This peptide causes constriction of blood vessels and stimulates the release of the hormones vasopressin and aldosterone, which increase blood pressure. See also ACE inhibitor; ANGIOTENSIN II ANTAGONIST.
## Source[^2]
- Any of three related peptide hormones, two of which raise blood pressure. Angiotensin I is derived, by the action of the enzyme renin, from a protein ( $\alpha$-globulin) secreted by the liver into the bloodstream. As blood passes through the lungs, another enzyme (angiotensin-converting enzyme; ACE) splits angiotensin I, forming angiotensin II. This causes constriction of blood vessels and stimulates the release of antidiuretic hormone and aldosterone, which increase blood pressure. Angiotensin III, formed by removal of a single amino acid from angiotensin II, also stimulates aldosterone release by the adrenal gland. Drugs that block the activity of ACE (ACE inhibitors) are widely used to treat chronic high blood pressure (hypertension).
