- $n$. In reaction time experiments in which a subject or participant moves a stylus as quickly as possible from a starting position to a target, a relation observed between movement time $(M T)$ on the one hand and target width $(W)$ and movement amplitude $(A)$ on the other, expressed by the equation $M T=a+b \log _{2}(2 A / W)$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants representing the intercept and slope of the function respectively. Thus movement time decreases with the size of the target and increases with the amplitude of the movement. Often incorrectly spelt Fitt's law. Compare Hick's law. \[Named after the US psychologist Paul Morris Fitts (1912-65) who formulated it in 1954]
