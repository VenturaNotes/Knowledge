- An economy with a mixture of state and private enterprises. Some economic activities are carried out by individuals or firms taking independent economic decisions, coordinated by markets; others are carried out by organizations under state ownership and control, with some degree of centralized decision-taking. Most actual economies are mixed, in the sense of having substantial elements of both forms of economic organization.
## Source[^2]
- An economy in which some goods and services are produced by the government and some by private enterprise. A mixed economy lies between a command economy and a complete laissez-faire economy. In practice, however, most economies are mixed; the significant feature is whether an economy is moving towards or away from a more laissez-faire situation.
