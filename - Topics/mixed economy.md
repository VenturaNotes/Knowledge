- An economy with a mixture of state and private enterprises. Some economic activities are carried out by individuals or firms taking independent economic decisions, coordinated by markets; others are carried out by organizations under state ownership and control, with some degree of centralized decision-taking. Most actual economies are mixed, in the sense of having substantial elements of both forms of economic organization.
