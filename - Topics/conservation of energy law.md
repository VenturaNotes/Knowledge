- $n$. The first law of thermodynamics, stating that when a system changes from one state to another, energy is converted to a different form but the total energy remains unchanged or is conserved, making a perpetual-motion machine impossible. It was discovered by the German physician and physicist Julius Mayer (1814-78), who submitted it to the leading physics journal Annalen der Physik, but it was rejected, and Mayer was forced to publish it in an obscure chemistry journal where it had little impact; then it was independently rediscovered by the Scottish physicist and mathematician William Thomson (later Lord Kelvin, 1824-1907), who presented it to the Royal Society in 1851 and was credited with its discovery. See also PRINCIPLE OF CONSTANCY.
