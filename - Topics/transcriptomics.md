- The study of the RNA transcripts of a cell, tissue, or organism (i.e. the transcriptome). Transcriptomics is concerned with determining how the transcriptome, and hence pattern of gene expression, changes with respect to various factors, such as type of tissue, stage of development, hormones, drugs, or disease. It complements and overlaps with proteomics.
