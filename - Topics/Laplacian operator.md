- A high-pass filter that is used in image processing to detect edges in an intensity-gradient image (see EDGE DETECTOR). Mathematically, the operator is based on the two-dimensional sum of the second derivatives of the image convolved with a Gaussian curve. The second derivatives detect rapid intensity changes and the Gaussian smooths out the effects of noise. The operator shows an interesting correspondence with biological detectors.
