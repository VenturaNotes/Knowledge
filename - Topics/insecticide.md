- $n$. a preparation used to kill insects. Ideally, an insecticide should have no toxic effects when ingested by human beings or animals, but modern powerful compounds have inherent dangers and have caused fatalities. Some insect powders contain organic phosphorus compounds and fluorides; when ingested accidentally they may cause damage to the nervous system. The use of such compounds is generally under strict control. See also DDT; DIELDRIN.
