- A market situation with a single buyer (a monopsonist) facing a single seller (a monopolist). This could arise where a single supplier firm faces a single government purchaser, for example the Ministry of Defence, or where a single trade union faces a single employer, for example a nationalized industry. Under bilateral monopoly, price and quantity are decided by bargaining between the two parties.

- A situation in which a monopoly seller bargains with a monopoly buyer (see MONOPSONY). The classic application of bilateral monopoly is to the negotiation of wages between a union and a firm. The most famous solution (1950) is that stated by John Nash, which suggests that both sides will settle for the wage that maximizes the benefits from cooperation.
