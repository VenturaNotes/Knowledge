- Service inventory refers to how much of a service a business can provide in a given period. For instance, a hotel might have a service inventory of 100 rooms per week. An accountancy firm might have a complex service inventory based on the accountants available and the time it takes to perform various financial services. In IT terms, service inventory refers to the IT services available at an organization and the time it would take to deploy each of those services. Service inventory also considers the cost, features, and benefits of each service.
