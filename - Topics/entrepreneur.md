- An individual who undertakes (from the French entreprendre to undertake) to supply a good or service to the market for profit. The entrepreneur will usually invest capital in the business and take on the risks associated with the investment. In most modern capitalist economies the initiative of entrepreneurs is regarded as an important element in creating a society's wealth; governments are therefore led to establish conditions in which they will thrive.

- A person with overall responsibility for decision-taking in a business, who receives any profits, and bears any losses. Entrepreneurs need not necessarily contribute either labour, which can be hired, or financial capital, which can be borrowed; but they must contribute either one of these or a credible guarantee, if their responsibility for possible losses is to be genuine. In a business run by a sole trader it is clear who is the entrepreneur; in incorporated businesses the role is dispersed among directors and shareholders.
