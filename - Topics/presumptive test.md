- Any device used to measure pressure. Three basic types are in use: the liquid-column gauge (e.g. the mercury barometer and the manometer), the expanding-element gauge (e.g. the Bourdon gauge and the aneroid barometer), and the electrical transducer. In the last category the strain gauge is an example. Capacitor pressure gauges also come into this category. In these devices, the pressure to be measured displaces one plate of a capacitor and thus alters its capacitance.
