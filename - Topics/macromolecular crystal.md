## Source [^1]
- A crystalline solid in which the atoms are all linked together by covalent bonds. Carbon (in diamond), boron nitride, and silicon carbide are examples of substances that have macromolecular crystals. In effect, the crystal is a large molecule (hence the alternative description giant-molecular), which accounts for the hardness and high melting point of such materials.
