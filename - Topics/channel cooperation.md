- Cooperation between members of a distribution channel as a result of harmonious marketing objectives and strategies. Problems can emerge when specific channel members have too much power or act negatively. Restriction of lines, limits on the number of new products, or the demand for promotional bonuses (typically a powerful retailer demanding cash for a promotion) by retailers and wholesalers can limit competition.
