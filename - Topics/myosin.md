## Synthesis
- Myosin is a [[motor protein]] that plays a key role in muscle contraction. It interacts with [[Microfilament|actin filaments]] and uses ATP ([[ATP|adenosine triphosphate]]) to generate force, leading to muscle movement
- Myosin is a [[protein]] because it is composed of [[Amino Acid|amino acids]] linked together in a specific sequence, forming a complex structure with heads and tails that allow it to bind to actin and facilitate movement using ATP
## Source[^1]
- A contractile protein that interacts with actin to bring about contraction of muscle or cell movement. The type of myosin molecule found in muscle fibers consists of a tail, by which it aggregates with other myosin molecules to form so-called ‘thick filaments’; and a globular head, which has sites for the attachment of actin and ATP molecules. See SARCOMERE; SLIDING FILAMENT THEORY.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the most abundant protein in muscle fibrils, having the important properties of elasticity and contractility. With actin, it comprises the principal contractile element of muscles. See STRIATED MUSCLE.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A protein that reacts with actin to form the contractile protein actomyosin in muscles and that is also present in other body cells. \[From Greek mys a muscle + -in(e) indicating an organic compound]
