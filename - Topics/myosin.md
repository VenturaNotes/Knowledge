## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Myosin is a [[motor protein]] that plays a key role in muscle contraction. It interacts with [[Microfilament|actin filaments]] and uses ATP ([[ATP|adenosine triphosphate]]) to generate force, leading to muscle movement
- Myosin is a [[protein]] because it is composed of [[Amino Acid|amino acids]] linked together in a specific sequence, forming a complex structure with heads and tails that allow it to bind to actin and facilitate movement using ATP
## Source[^2]
- A contractile protein that interacts with actin to bring about contraction of muscle or cell movement. The type of myosin molecule found in muscle fibres consists of a tail, by which it aggregates with other myosin molecules to form so-called ‘thick filaments’; and a globular head, which has sites for the attachment of actin and ATP molecules. See SARCOMERE; SLIDING FILAMENT THEORY.
