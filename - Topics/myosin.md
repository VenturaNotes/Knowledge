## Source [^1]
- Myosin is a [[motor protein]] that plays a key role in muscle contraction. It interacts with [[Microfilament|actin filaments]] and uses ATP ([[ATP|adenosine triphosphate]]) to generate force, leading to muscle movement
- Myosin is a [[protein]] because it is composed of [[Amino Acid|amino acids]] linked together in a specific sequence, forming a complex structure with heads and tails that allow it to bind to actin and facilitate movement using ATP
