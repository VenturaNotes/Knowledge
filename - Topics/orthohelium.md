- A form of helium once thought to exist as one of two species of the element. Because the spectrum of atomic helium consists of transitions between singlet states (including transitions from the ground state) and transitions between triplet states but not transitions between singlet and triplet states, early spectroscopists thought that two species of helium existed. The other form was called parahelium.
