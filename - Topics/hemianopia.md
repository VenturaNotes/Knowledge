- $n$. absence of half of the normal field of vision. The commonest type is homonymous hemianopia, in which the same half (right or left) is lost in both eyes. Sometimes the inner halves of the visual field are lost in both eyes, producing a binasal hemianopia, while in others the outer halves are lost, producing a bitemporal hemianopia. Very rarely both upper halves or both lower halves are lost, producing an altitudinal hemianopia.
