- $n$. absence of half of the normal field of vision. The commonest type is homonymous hemianopia, in which the same half (right or left) is lost in both eyes. Sometimes the inner halves of the visual field are lost in both eyes, producing a binasal hemianopia, while in others the outer halves are lost, producing a bitemporal hemianopia. Very rarely both upper halves or both lower halves are lost, producing an altitudinal hemianopia.

- $n$. Blindness in the left or right visual field affecting one or both eyes, left hemianopia referring to loss of the left visual field and right hemianopia to loss of the right visual field. Also called hemianopsia, hemiamblyopia, or hemiopia. See also homonymous hemiANOPA, NASAL hemiANOPA, SPATIAL NEGLECT. \[From Greek hemi- half + an- without + ops an eye + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
