## Source[^2]
- (auricle) (pl. pinnae) The visible part of the outer ear, present in some mammals. It is made of cartilage and its function is to channel sound waves into the external auditory meatus. In some species the pinna is movable and aids in detecting the direction from which a sound originates.
