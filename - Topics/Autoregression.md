- $n$. A property of a time series in which each score is a linear function of the preceding score (first-order autoregression) or of more than one of the preceding scores (higher-order autoregression). Such a series, even with only first-order autoregression, has a memory in the sense that each score is correlated with all preceding scores. See also arima, AUTOCORRELATION. autoregressive adj. \[From Greek autos self + English regression]
