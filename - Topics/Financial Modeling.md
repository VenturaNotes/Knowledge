- Financial modeling means using an organization’s financial records to predict future financial performance. It’s a way of forecasting how a business will grow, how particular assets will perform, and how impactful each business decision will be. Financial modeling uses a business’s historical as well as current financial performance records, such as records of costs, expenses, and profits. Businesses can also use financial modeling to compare actual results against forecast results, and investigate what may have caused any differences.
