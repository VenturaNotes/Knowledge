## Synthesis

- A mechanism proposed in 1890 by Emil Fischer (1852-1919) to explain binding between the active site of an enzyme and a substrate molecule. The active site was thought to have a fixed structure (the lock), which exactly matched the structure of a specific substrate (the key). Thus the enzyme and substrate interact to form an enzyme-substrate complex. The substrate is converted to products that no longer fit the active site and are therefore released, liberating the enzyme. Observations made by X-ray diffraction studies have shown that the active site of an enzyme is more flexible and dynamic than the lock-and-key theory would suggest. Compare INDUCED-FIT MODEL.
