- $n$. A model of leadership style and leadership effectiveness proposed by the US-based Austrian psychologist Fred E(dward) Fiedler (born 1922) in his book A Theory of Leadership Effectiveness (1967), according to which a directive, authoritarian leadership style is most effective when circumstances are either very unfavorable or very favorable for the leader, and non-directive leadership is most effective in intermediate circumstances. The three key factors determining the favorableness of the circumstances for the leader are leader-member relations (how much the leader is liked and respected by the group members), position power (how much authority the leader has over the group members), and task structure (how structured the group task is).
