- A projection device used in studies of visual perception and memory. In advertising and marketing research it is used to measure the extent to which the features of an advertisement or brand are registered by consumers. The tachistoscope shows a package or advertisement for a very brief period (which can be varied), enabling researchers to test the effectiveness of the design, color, lay-out, or name. Tachistoscope tests are often undertaken before the product or advertisement is released. Various methods of achieving the same effect on a computer screen have been explored but the projection method is still generally preferred.
