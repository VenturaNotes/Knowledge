- $n$. In neo-Freudian theory, a term used by the German-born US psychoanalyst Erich Fromm (1900-80) to denote a category of people who consider their personalities as commodities to be bought and sold and who mould themselves to fit whatever qualities are demanded by others, with consequent superficiality and lack of individuality. Compare EXPLOITATIVE ORIENTATION, HOARDING ORIENTATION, PRODUCTIVE ORIENTATION, RECEPTIVE ORIENTATION.
