- (adhesive capsulitis) a well-defined disorder characterized by progressive pain and then stiffness of the shoulder that has no clear single cause and usually resolves spontaneously over about 18 months. It may occur after trauma and is more common with diabetes mellitus. Initial treatment during the painful inflammatory phase is with analgesics and anti-inflammatory drugs. During the stiff phase, when the pain and inflammation has settled, gentle physiotherapy and possible manipulation under anaesthesia is performed to help regain range of motion.
