- $n$. any of various disorders of the retina resulting in impairment or loss of vision. It is usually due to damage to the blood vessels of the retina, occurring (for example) as a complication of longstanding diabetes (diabetic retinopathy), high blood pressure, or AIDS (AIDS retinopathy). In diabetic retinopathy, haemorrhaging or exudation may occur, either from damaged vessels into the retina or from new abnormal vessels (see NEOVASCULARIZATION) into the vitreous humour. The later stages require laser treatment (see PHOTOCOAGULATION). In the UK all people with diabetes are screened using annual digital retinal photography. The warning signs of potentially sight-threatening retinal changes can be spotted and referral to a specialist eye clinic made for further assessment and intervention to prevent a deterioration in vision. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), formerly known as retrolental fibroplasia, is the abnormal growth of developing retinal blood vessels seen in premature infants. It may be mild and resolve spontaneously or severe enough to lead to blindness if untreated.
