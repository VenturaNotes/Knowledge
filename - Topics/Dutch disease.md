- The deindustrialization of an economy as a result of the discovery of a natural resource, so named because it occurred in Holland after the discovery of North Sea gas. The discovery of such a resource lifts the value of the country's currency, making manufactured goods less competitive; exports therefore decline and imports rise.
## Source[^2]
- This refers to an increase in one form of export driving up a country's exchange rate, which handicaps the sale of other exports and impairs the ability of domestic products to compete with imports. The name comes from the supposed effect of natural gas discoveries on the economy of the Netherlands. The Dutch disease is also called the resource curse because a natural resource is often the single largest export item of a resource-rich country.
