- A chemical that either physically damages a nerve or reduces or alters the function of the nerve. An example of a neurotoxin is 6-hydroxydopamine, which damages the nerve terminals of the sympathetic neurons. This compound is structurally similar to dopamine and noradrenaline and can enter the nerve terminal by existing transport systems.
