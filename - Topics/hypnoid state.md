- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a concept introduced by the Austrian physician Josef Breuer (1842-1925) to denote a state of consciousness resembling hypnosis, occurring when an emotion intrudes into a reverie or daydream. Breuer's theory is set out in Freud's Standard Edition, II, pp. 183-252. The concept was later (1901/5) repudiated by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) in his 'Fragment of an Analysis of a Case of Hysteria' (Standard Edition, VII, pp. 7-122, at p. 27n). See also HYpnoID HYSTERIA.
