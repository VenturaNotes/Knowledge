- A nonrepetitive waveform that rises or falls exponentially from some initial value at some initial time, according to the law

  

$$

y(t)=\mathrm{e}^{a t}

$$

  

For $a>0$ the waveform rises without bound with increasing time $t$; for $a<0$ the waveform decays to zero. One way in which logic signals can become distorted as they travel through a system is for their switching edges to become exponentials, usually due to capacitive loading when the output waveform follows the law

  

$$

v(t)=V(1-\exp (-t / C R))

$$

  

where $V$ is the final voltage, $R$ the source resistance, and $C$ the capacitive load.
