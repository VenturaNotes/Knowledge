- The situation in which the yield on long-term fixed-interest securities is greater than the dividend yield on equities (see YIELD GAP). In the UK, such a situation prevailed from the late 1950s until the late 2000s.
## Source[^2]
- An excess of returns on government bonds above those on equities. This is likely to occur during periods of high inflation because equities are expected to provide capital gains to compensate for inflation while bonds are not. During periods of stable prices the yield gap is usually positive: a greater yield on equities is needed to compensate investors for their relative riskiness.
