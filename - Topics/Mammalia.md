- A class of vertebrates containing some 5700 species. Mammals are warmblooded animals (see homoiOTHERMY), typically having sweat glands whose secretion cools the skin and an insulating body covering of hair. All female mammals have mammary glands, which secrete milk to nourish the young. Mammalian teeth are differentiated into incisors, canines, premolars, and molars and the middle ear contains three sound-conducting ear ossicles. The four-chambered heart enables complete separation of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood and a muscular diaphragm takes part in breathing movements, both of which ensure that the tissues are well supplied with oxygen. This, together with well-developed sense organs and brain, have enabled mammals to pursue an active life and to colonize a wide variety of habitats.
- Mammals evolved from synapsid ancestors during the Triassic period, and the first true mammals emerged during the Jurassic (201 to 145 mya). There are two subclasses: the primitive egg-laying Prototheria (monotremes) and the Theria, which includes all other mammals and consists of the infraclasses Metatheria (marsupials) and Eutheria (placental mammals).
