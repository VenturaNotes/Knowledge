- Costs incurred in the process of selling products. This covers items such as the cost of advertisements on hoardings or in the media, exhibiting at trade fairs, or employment of representatives or door-to-door salespeople. It does not normally cover the costs of design and quality control, though these may be more important than selling costs in making products marketable.
