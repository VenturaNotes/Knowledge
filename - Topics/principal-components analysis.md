- $n$. A statistical technique applied to a correlation matrix to combine observed variables into weighted linear combinations of the original variables called principal components, which are all uncorrelated with one another. The first principal component explains the maximum proportion of the variance, and successive principal components explain progressively smaller portions of the variance. This technique is closely related to factor analysis. See also Cluster analysis, CORRESPONDENCE ANALYSIS. PCA abbrev.
