## Source [^1]
- (1) A flexible one-dimensional array, i.e. a flexible vector, of symbols where the lower bound of the vector is fixed at unity but the upper bound, i.e. the string length, may vary. 
- (2) A type of input to a graphics system consisting of a sequence of characters. The usual input device is a keyboard. See also LOGICAL INPUT DEVICE. 
- (3) Any one-dimensional array of characters. In formal language theory a string is often referred to as a word. See also SEQUENCE.
## Source[^2]
- In the computer programming space, string describes a data type that is stored as a sequence of text in a program's source code. A string typically appears as plain language in computer code and is explicitly interpreted by a computer script. Strings are often used by software development companies to efficiently store, find, or change data within a computer program.
