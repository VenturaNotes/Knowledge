A psychometric test in which the respondent has to arrange groups of 4,9, or 16 multi-coloured blocks to copy patterns presented on test cards, designed originally to differentiate brain-damaged from psychiatric patients, later adapted as an intelligence subtest and incorporated into the Wechsler scales, the Goldstein-Scheerer tests, and other IQ tests. \[Named after the US psychologist Samuel Calmin Kohs (1890-1984) who introduced it]
