- A uniform resource name (URN) is a unique, persistent string of characters assigned to a data resource that allows it to be easily recognized by a computer program. Unlike uniform resource locators (URLs), URNs cannot be used to find a data resource's exact location on the internet. Their only function is to assign a unique identifier to a data resource so that it can be effectively identified by a program. A URN and URL work together to allow end users to identify and locate specific web content on the internet.
