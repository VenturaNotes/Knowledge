- A public-private partnership (PPP) is a long-term business arrangement between a private party and a government entity that is often used to finance public infrastructure projects. These projects often involve the creation, operation, and maintenance of community parks, hospitals, schools, civic centers, public transportation networks, as well as water and sewage systems. PPPs allow city governments that may not have access to the financial resources, specialized personnel, or technological innovations necessary to fund these projects to partner with private parties who do. The private parties that help fund these projects often receive a portion of the operating profit once the project has been completed.

- (PPP) In the UK, any of various schemes devised to bring private-sector investment and expertise into the provision of public services. Examples include the private-finance initiative (PFI) hospital-building programme in the National Health Service, the sale of local authority housing stock to housing associations, and the failed plan to modernize and refurbish the London Underground. Advocates of the policy claim that it will result in better services and lower costs; sceptics argue that the real attraction to government is the fact that PPPs enable upfront borrowing costs to be passed to the private sector, thus improving the Treasury balance sheet.
