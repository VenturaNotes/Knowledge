- One of the two symbols $\forall$ or $\exists$ used in predicate calculus. $\forall$ is the [[universal quantifier]] and is read 'for all'. $\exists$ is the existential quantifier and is read 'there exists' or 'for some'. In either case the reference is to possible values of the variable $v$ that the quantifier introduces. $\forall v . F$ means that the formula $F$ is true for all values of $v$, while $\exists v . F$ means that $F$ is true for at least one value of $v$. As an example, suppose that $P(x, y)$ is the predicate ' $x$ is less than or equal to $y$ '. Then the following expression

  

$$

\exists x . \forall y . P(x, y)

$$

  

says that there exists an $x$ that is less than or equal to all $y$. This statement is true if values range over the natural numbers, since $x$ can be taken to be 0 . It becomes false however if values are allowed to range over negative integers as well. Note also that it would be false even for natural numbers if the predicate were ' $x$ is less than $y$ '. Other notations such as $(\forall v) F$ in place of $\forall v . F$ are also found.
