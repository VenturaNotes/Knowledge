- $n$. The study of the nature of knowledge and beliefs, the intelligibility of concepts, and the validity of arguments. Its main branches include metaphysics, the study of the nature and phenomena of reality; epistemology, the theory of knowledge, especially the investigation of what distinguishes mere belief from knowledge; ethics, the study of moral principles and judgements; and semantics, the study of the relationship between linguistic expressions and their meanings. A useful informal definition of philosophy is thought about thought. \[From Greek philosophia love of wisdom, from philos loving, from phileein to love + sophia wisdom]
