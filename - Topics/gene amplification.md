## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The multiple replication of a section of the genome, which occurs during a single cell cycle and results in the production of many copies of a specific sequence of the DNA molecule. For example, in the oocytes of amphibians and other animals, in which large numbers of ribosomes are needed, the genes encoding ribosomal RNA are greatly amplified. Viral genes that cause the formation of tumours (see ONCOGENE) are amplified in tumor cells.

- $n$. The duplication of a gene to produce multiple copies of it within a cell nucleus.
