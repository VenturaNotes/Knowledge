- For a function $f$, which is holomorphic inside and on a simple, closed, positively oriented, continuous, piecewise-smooth curve $C$ in c, except at finitely many isolated singularities $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}$ inside $C$$$\int_{C} f(z)~~ \mathrm{d} z=2 \pi i \sum_{k=1}^{n} \operatorname{Res}\left(f ; a_{k}\right),$$where $\operatorname{Res}\left(f ; a_{k}\right)$ denotes the residue of $f$ at $a_{k}$.
