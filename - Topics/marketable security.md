- A security which can be sold in a secondary market. Examples include common stock and bonds. This is contrasted with a non-marketable security, for example National Savings in the UK, which can only be turned into cash by selling them back to the issuer. Assets such as mortgages which are individually non-marketable may be made marketable by securitization, combining them into packages which can then be marketed.
