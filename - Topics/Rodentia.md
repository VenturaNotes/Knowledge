- An order of mammals characterized by a single pair of long curved incisors in each jaw. These teeth are specialized for gnawing: they continue growing throughout life and have enamel only on the front so that they wear to a chisel-shaped cutting edge. Rodents often breed throughout the year and produce large numbers of quickly maturing young. The order includes the squirrels, beavers, rats, mice, and porcupines.
