- (long-sightedness) $n$. the condition in which parallel light rays are brought to a focus behind the retina when the accommodation is relaxed (see illustration). Moderate degrees of hypermetropia may not cause blurred vision in children and young adults because of their ability to accommodate, but for older people and those with greater degrees of hypermetropia near vision is more blurred than distance vision. Normal vision can be restored by wearing spectacles with convex lenses. Compare EMMETROPIA; MYOPIA.
