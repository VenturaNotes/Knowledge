- (long-sightedness) $n$. the condition in which parallel light rays are brought to a focus behind the retina when the accommodation is relaxed (see illustration). Moderate degrees of hypermetropia may not cause blurred vision in children and young adults because of their ability to accommodate, but for older people and those with greater degrees of hypermetropia near vision is more blurred than distance vision. Normal vision can be restored by wearing spectacles with convex lenses. Compare EMMETROPIA; MYOPIA.

	- Hypermetropia (long-sightedness)
	- Uncorrected
		- focusing point is beyond the retina
	- Corrected
		- Convex lens converges light rays falling on the eye
## Source[^2]
- (hyperopia) Long-sightedness. A vision defect in which the lens of the eye is unable to accommodate sufficiently to throw the image of near objects onto the retina. It is caused usually by shortness of the eyeball rather than any fault in the lens system. The subject requires spectacles with converging lenses to bring the image from behind the retina back on to its surface (see illustration).
