- False conception that an event becomes more likely if it has been underrepresented so far in a sequence of observations. For example, if a fair coin has been tossed six times, and has come up with five heads and only one instance of tails, the ‘law of averages’ incorrectly suggests that tails is more likely on the next toss. But as each toss is independent, the probability of tails remains unchanged.
