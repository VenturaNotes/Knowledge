- The minimal number of independent characteristics, or variables, required to specify completely the state of the system at a given moment. If there exists a constraint or a set of constraints on these variables, in other words, relationships among the variables, each such constraint reduces the number of degrees of freedom. Thus, the number of degrees of freedom equals the number of variables that completely specify the system less the number of constraints imposed on these variables. For example, the number of degrees of freedom for the least squares residuals from a linear regression model with $K$ parameters estimated from a sample of $N$ observations equals $(N-K)$, since in minimizing the sum of squared residuals $K$ first-order conditions are imposed on $N$ data points.

- In statistical analysis, the number of independent observations associated with an estimate of variance (see MEASURES OF VARIATION) or of a component of an analysis of variance. The simplest example is in estimating the variance of a sample of $n$ observations, where the degrees of freedom is $n-1$, the divisor of the sum of squared deviations from the sample mean. More generally, the degrees of freedom, $f$, is the difference between the number of parameters in a given model, and a special case of that model with fewer parameters. The number of degrees of freedom is required when selecting a particular instance of the chi-squared distribution, Student's t distribution, or F distribution.
