- The series of steps undertaken to allow an organization to move away from its current infrastructure (hardware, software, or network). The term is frequently used in connection with the introduction of new aspects of an IT service, where it is essential both to maintain an existing service, to introduce a new service, and to allow the old and the new services at least to coexist and possibly to interwork.
