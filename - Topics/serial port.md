- An input/output socket on a computer or other device that is used for serial input/output, often making use of the RS232C standard. The physical port may have a 25- or 9-pin subminiature D connector or an RJ45 connector (which looks like a telephone connector). From the software, a serial port is usually treated as a device rather than a file. Compare PARALLEL PORT.
