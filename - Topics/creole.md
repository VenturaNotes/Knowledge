- $n$. A form of language, originally a pidgin, that has become the mother tongue of a speech community through a process of linguistic development whereby an increasing proportion of a community use the pidgin as their primary mode of communication and children begin to adopt it as their mother tongue. Striking similarities, such as similar rules for conjugating verbs, have been noted in the structure of all creole languages and cannot be explained by a common ancestor language or exposure to other languages, which suggests that what is common to creole languages in widely scattered communities may be the basis of language acquisition everywhere, or that children learn languages by first constructing an abstract form of a creole. See also Black English Vernacular, CREOLIZATION, DECREOLIZATION, HYPERCREOLIZATION. \[From Portuguese crioulo, which originally meant a person of European descent born and brought up in a colonial territory]
