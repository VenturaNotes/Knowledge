- $n$. In statistics, a popular technique of cluster analysis in which the distance between two clusters is defined as the average of the distances between all pairs of individuals or cases formed by taking one from each cluster. In contrast to single and complete linkage methods, it uses information about all pairs of distances, not just the nearest or the furthest. Also called the unweighted pair-group method using arithmetic averages (UPGMA).
