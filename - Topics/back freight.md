- The cost of shipping goods back to the port of destination after they have been overcarried. If the master overcarried the goods for reasons beyond his control, the shipowner may be responsible for paying the back freight. If delivery was not accepted in reasonable time at the port of destination and the master took the goods on or sent them back to the port of shipment, the back freight would be the responsibility of the cargo owner.
