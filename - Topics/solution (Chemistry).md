## Synthesis
- A homogeneous mixture of two or more substances where one substance (the [[solute]]) is evenly distributed throughout another substance (the [[solvent]])
	- This means the mixture appears uniform throughout and the components cannot be easily distinguished from each other
- Essentially, a substance dissolved in another substance
	- Like salt dissolved in water
- Example
	- When sugar (solute) is dissolved in water (solvent), it forms a clear, uniform solution
