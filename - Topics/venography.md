- (phlebography) $n$. imaging of the veins. Traditionally a radiopaque contrast medium is injected into a vein and X-ray photographs (venograms) taken as the medium flows towards the heart. Damage, obstruction, or abnormal communication with other vessels can be demonstrated. It can be done during a CT or MRI evaluation. A common usage is in demonstrating deep vein thrombosis in the legs. Increasingly ultrasound is being used, both with colour Doppler (see Doppler ULTRASOUND) and compression venography. See also ANGIOGRAPHY.
