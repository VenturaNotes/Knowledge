- Customer Experience (CX) refers to customers' thoughts, feelings, and perceptions when interacting with an SMB, its channels or products. Examples of CX include how customers develop relationships with organizations orÂ customers signing up for free trials. Through these interactions, customers develop impressions of organizations. A customer's experiences can influence their behavior and purchasing habits:
	- Positive experiences can boost brand loyalty, improve sales, and increase product awareness among target groups.
	- Negative experiences can result in bad word-of-mouth, negative PR, and lost revenue.
