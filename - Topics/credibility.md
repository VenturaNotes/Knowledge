- The extent to which policy announcements are believed. Policy announcements by monetary or fiscal authorities are credible if it is rational for people to believe that the authorities will in fact carry out their announced policies. Thus, if the authorities have no incentive to deviate from the announced policies in the future, these policies are credible. When there is an incentive to deviate, credibility may be achieved if the authorities have a sufficiently long reputation, or history of holding to their promises. See also REPUTATIONAL POLICY.

- $n$. The quality of meriting belief or confidence. In social psychology, the persuasiveness of a person or message source, generally associated with prestige. Research has shown that it consists of two major components, namely perceived trustworthiness and perceived competence or expertness, and a multiplicative model is required to represent the way they combine: if either approaches zero, then so does credibility, irrespective of the value of the other. The first serious discussion of it was by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 вс) in his Rhetoric, the key passage being: 'Persuasion is achieved by the speaker's personal character when the speech is also spoken as to make us think him credible. We believe good men more fully and more readily than others; this is true generally whatever the question is, and absolutely true where exact certainty is impossible and opinions are divided’ (Book I, Chapter 2, Bekker edition, p. 1356a). See also PRESTIGE SUGGESTION, SLEEPER EFFECT.
