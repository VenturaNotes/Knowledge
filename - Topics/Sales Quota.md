- A sales quota is a sales goal or sales target that an individual (or team) must achieve in a set time period. These numbers are set by the company as performance benchmarks. Meeting quotas may be necessary for continued employment. It may also mean that a salesperson or division gets a bonus for meeting their quota. Making or missing a sales quota is often used as part of evaluations.
