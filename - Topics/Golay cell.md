- A transparent cell containing gas, used to detect infrared radiation. Incident radiation is absorbed within the cell, causing a rise in the gas temperature and pressure. The amount of incident radiation can be measured from the pressure rise in the tube. The Golay cell was invented by Marcel Golay (1902-89) in 1947.
