- $n$. an external agent that, when applied to cells or organisms, can increase the rate of mutation. Mutagens usually only increase the number of mutants formed and do not cause mutations not found under natural conditions. Several kinds of radiation, many chemicals, and certain viruses can act as mutagens. Compare ANTIMUTAGEN.
## Source[^2]
- An agent that causes an increase in the number of mutants (see MUTATION) in a population. Mutagens operate either by causing changes in the base sequence of the DNA of the genes, so interfering with the coding system, or by causing chromosome damage. Various chemicals (e.g. aflatoxin, benzopyrene in cigarette smoke, colchicine), forms of radiation (e.g. X-rays, gamma rays), and retroviruses are among the many agents identified as mutagens.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any substance or other agent, including X-rays and other forms of ionizing radiation, that can cause genetic mutations. See also teratogen. \[From muta(tion) + Greek genein to produce]
