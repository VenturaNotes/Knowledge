- The culture of complete living organs (explants) of animals and plants outside the body in a suitable culture medium. Animal organs must be small enough to allow the nutrients in the culture medium to penetrate all the cells. Whole plant roots and even root systems can be kept alive in such conditions for a considerable period of time. See also EXPLANTATION; SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY.
