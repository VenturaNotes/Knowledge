- Vanity metrics are performance statistics that appear satisfying on paper, but in reality do not provide any valuable business insights. Vanity metrics include social media likes, shares, comments, views, followers, and other performance metrics that do not necessarily prove that a companyâ€™s marketing efforts are effective. For example, the number of followers an artist has on a social media platform does not necessarily correlate to the amount of albums they are able to sell. However, vanity metrics can help with the measurement of non-transactional marketing goals such as brand awareness.
