- (Rokitansky-K端sterHauser syndrome, M端llerian agenesis) congenital absence of the uterus and upper part of the vagina due to failure of development of the M端llerian duct. It may be associated with skeletal, renal, and auditory abnormalities, but usually presents with amenorrhoea in a patient with otherwise normal secondary sexual characteristics. There is a multidisciplinary approach to treatment, with psychological support, counselling, discussion of creation of a 'neovagina' with gradual use of vaginal dilators, and/or surgical vaginal reconstruction. Surrogacy is the only option for childbearing, although oocyte donation from the mother to a surrogate can be discussed. \[K. W.
