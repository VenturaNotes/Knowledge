## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The interaction of ions of a solute with the molecules of solvent. For instance, when sodium chloride is dissolved in water the sodium ions attract polar water molecules, with the negative oxygen atoms pointing towards the positive $Na^+$ ion. Solvation of transition-metal ions can also occur by formation of coordinate bonds, as in the hexaquocopper($II$) ion $[Cu(H_2O)_6]^{2+}$. Solvation is the process that causes ionic solids to dissolve, because the energy released compensates for the energy necessary to break down the crystal lattice. It occurs only with polar solvents. Solvation in which the solvent is water is called hydration.
