- (operational research, OR) The study of some human operation or set of operations by quantitative means. It is usually conducted with the aid of computer modelling; models may be hypothesized and fitted to experimental data, or experimental data may be analyzed to derive a model. Once a model is available, the effects of changes in the operations under study can be developed and predicted in a quantitative way.
