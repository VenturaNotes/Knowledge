- pl. n. (sing. meninx) the three connective tissue membranes that line the skull and vertebral canal and enclose the brain and spinal cord (see illustration). The outermost layer $\textendash$ the dura mater (pachymeninx) $\textendash$ is inelastic, tough, and thicker than the middle layer (the arachnoid mater) and the innermost layer (the pia mater). The inner two membranes are together called the leptomeninges; between them circulates the cerebrospinal fluid.
