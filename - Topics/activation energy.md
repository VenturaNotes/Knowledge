## Synthesis
- The minimum amount of energy required for a chemical reaction to occur
## Source[^1]
- Symbol $E_{\mathrm{a}}$. The minimum energy required for a chemical reaction to take place. In a reaction, the reactant molecules come together and chemical bonds are stretched, broken, and formed in producing the products. During this process the energy of the system increases to a maximum, then decreases to the energy of the products. The activation energy is the difference between the maximum energy and the energy of the reactants; i.e. it is the energy barrier that has to be overcome for the reaction to proceed. The activation energy determines the way in which the rate of the reaction varies with temperature. It is usual to express activation energies in joules per mole of reactants.
