- a serious condition in which a person with diabetes loses the earliest warning signs of an approaching hypoglycaemic episode. Such people may suffer a severe attack of hypoglycaemia, with confusion, seizures, or even coma and death, because they fail to take the necessary measures to abort the episode. The condition is more common in longstanding diabetes and in those who experience frequent hypoglycaemic episodes. People with hypoglycaemic unawareness should not drive. Some awareness of hypoglycaemia may be restored by careful avoidance of more episodes, ensuring that the blood glucose level never falls below $4 ~\mathrm{mmol} / \mathrm{l}$.
