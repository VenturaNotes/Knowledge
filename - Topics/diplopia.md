- $n$. double vision: the simultaneous awareness of two images of one object. It is usually due to limitation of movement of one eye so that the two eyes cannot simultaneously look at the same object. This may be caused by a defect of the nerves or muscles controlling eye movement or a mechanical restriction of eyeball movement in the orbit (binocular diplopia). Double vision that does not disappear on covering one eye (monocular diplopia) can be caused by early cataract (see also POLYOPIA).
## Source[^2]
- $n$. Double vision resulting from incorrect fixation or defective functioning of the extra-ocular muscles or the nerves that control the muscles, sometimes resulting from fatigue, stress, or intoxication by alcohol or other depressant drugs. Diplopia when looking down, as when descending stairs, is a cardinal symptom of malfunction of the trochlear nerve. See also binocular disparity. \[From Greek diploos double + ops an eye + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
