- n. A large positive evoked potential that occurs approximately 300 milliseconds after the presentation of a stimulus, especially one that is unexpected, interesting, or potentially important, and that is believed to indicate that the stimulus has been appraised. A low-amplitude P300 is a firmly established sign of schizophrenia. The P300 latency increases between 1 and 2 milliseconds per year of the adult lifespan. Also called the P300 potential or P300 wave. \[From p(ositive) 300 (milliseconds)]
