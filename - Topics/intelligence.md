- The coordination of memory, learning, and reasoning in animals. Intelligence has also been defined as the ability of an animal to form associative links between events or objects of which it has had no previous experience (see INSIGHT LEARNING). In humans intelligence can be expressed as an intelligence quotient (IQ): the mental age of the subject (as measured by standard tests) divided by his or her real age $\times 100$. Psychologists have identified different types of intelligence, such as analytical intelligence, creative intelligence, and practical intelligence. Certainly, a high IQ score does not necessarily reflect prowess in other areas such as creativity, empathy, or sociability.
