## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An $n$-stage counter that is formed from $n$ cascaded flip-flops. The clock input to each of the individual flip-flops, with the exception of the first, is taken from the output of the preceding one. The count thus ripples along the counter's length due to the propagation delay associated with each stage of counting. See also CASCADABLE COUNTER, SYNCHRONOUS COUNTER.
