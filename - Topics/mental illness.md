## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- a disorder of one or more of the functions of the mind (such as mood, affect, perception, memory, or thought), which causes suffering to the patient or others. Symptoms of mental illness may be dimensional and only become pathological if at the severe end of the spectrum. Some mental illnesses are syndromes, which are characterized by a set of different symptoms that rarely all happen at once.
- Mental illness should be distinguished from learning disability, in which an individual has a general failure of development of the normal intellectual capacities. Mental illnesses are broadly divided into disorders in which the capacity for appreciating reality is lost (see PSYCHOSIS) and those in which it is preserved (see NEUROSIS).
