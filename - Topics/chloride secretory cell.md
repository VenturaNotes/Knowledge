- Any of the cells in the gills of marine bony fish that remove chloride from the blood and secrete it into the sea, thereby maintaining the osmotic composition of the body. The excretion of chloride is accompanied by movement of sodium ions from the blood to the sea, which keeps the electrochemical balance of the fish's body neutral.
