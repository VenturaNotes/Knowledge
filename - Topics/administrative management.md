- A traditional view of management that focuses on how a business should be organized and the practices an effective manager should follow. The two major contributors to this school of thought were Henri Fayol (1930) and Max Weber (1922). Fayol's 14 principles of management are still relevant, while Weber's bureaucracy model still has some relevance in medium and large organizations.
