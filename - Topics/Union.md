- Formula for union of two sets
	- $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$ 
	- #comment Works for disjoint sets as well but $|A \cap B| = 0$ 

## Source[^3]
- 1. (of two sets) The set that results from combining the elements of two sets $S$ and $T$, say, usually expressed as

  

$$

S \cup T

$$

  

$U$ is regarded as an operation on sets, the union operation, which is commutative and associative. Symbolically

  

$$

S \cup T=\{x \mid x \in S \text { or } x \in T\}

$$

  

The union of $S$ and the empty set is $S$. See also SET AlGEBRA. 2. (of two graphs, $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$ ) The graph that includes all the vertices and edges of $G_{1}$ and $G_{2}$, i.e. that contains the union of the two sets of vertices and of the two sets of edges as its vertices and edges.
