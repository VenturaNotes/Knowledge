- A financial institution, usually a merchant bank or investment bank, that specializes in the flotation of private companies on a stock exchange. In some cases the issuing house will itself purchase the whole issue (see UNDERWRITER), thus ensuring that there is no uncertainty in the amount of money the company will raise by flotation. It will then sell the shares to the public, usually by an offer for sale, introduction, issue by tender, or placing.
