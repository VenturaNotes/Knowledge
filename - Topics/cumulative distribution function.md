- AKA cdf
- For a random variable X, the cumulative distribution function (or cdf) is the function $F_X$ defined by $F_X(x) = Pr(X \le x)$. Thus, for a discrete random variable, $$F(x) = \sum_{x_i \le x} p(x_i),$$ where $p_X$ is the probability mass function, and, for a continuous random variable, with a probability density function $f_X$ then $$F_X(x) = \int_{- \infty}^{x} f_X(t) dt$$
## Source[^2]
- The cdf of a random variable $X$ at point $x$ is the probability that $X$ takes values at or below this point. Hence, $F(x)=\mathrm{P}[X \leq x]$. The following properties must hold for any cdf: it is a non-decreasing right-continuous function; it tends to 0 at minus infinity and tends to 1 at plus infinity.
