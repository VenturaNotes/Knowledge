- AKA cdf
- For a random variable X, the cumulative distribution function (or cdf) is the function $F_X$ defined by $F_X(x) = Pr(X \le x)$. Thus, for a discrete random variable, $$F(x) = \sum_{x_i \le x} p(x_i),$$ where $p_X$ is the probability mass function, and, for a continuous random variable, with a probability density function $f_X$ then $$F_X(x) = \int_{- \infty}^{x} f_X(t) dt$$
