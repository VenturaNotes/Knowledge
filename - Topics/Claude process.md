- A process for liquefying air on a commercial basis. Air under pressure is used as the working substance in a piston engine, where it does external work and cools adiabatically. This cool air is fed to a countercurrent heat exchanger, where it reduces the temperature of the next intake of high-pressure air. The same air is re-compressed and used again, and after several cycles eventually liquefies. The process was perfected in 1902 by the French scientist Georges Claude (1870–1960).
