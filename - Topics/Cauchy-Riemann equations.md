- For a holomorphic function $f(z)=u+i v$ of the complex variable $z=x+i y$ the Cauchy-Riemann equations state$$\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}=\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \quad \frac{\partial u}{\partial y}=-\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}.$$If these partial derivatives are continuous and satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations, then conversely $f(z)$ is holomorphic.
