- Financial metrics that are used to measure a company's ability to generate profit relative to other key variables, such as sales, assets, or equity. Different measures of profitability may be used, including gross profit, EBITDA, EBIT, and net profit. The ratio is applied to a particular period of trading. Some commonly employed profitability ratios include net profit percentage, gross profit percentage, and return on capital employed, in which an agreed measure of profit is expressed as a proportion of total investment. See RATIO ANALYSIS.
