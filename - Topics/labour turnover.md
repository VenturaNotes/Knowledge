- The inflow and outflow of labour employed by an enterprise. Some of this is because of fluctuations in total employment over time, either seasonally or cyclically. Some turnover results from geographical mobility of activity, notably in the construction sector. Some results from the ageing of the labour force: older workers retire and young people enter employment. There is also a large amount of turnover as individuals choose to move between jobs.
