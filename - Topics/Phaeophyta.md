- (brown algae) A phylum (or group, i.e. the phaeophytes) of protist algae, now considered to be stramenopiles, in which the green chlorophyll pigments are usually masked by the brown pigment fucoxanthin. Brown algae are usually marine (being abundant in cold water) and many species, such as the wracks (Fucus), inhabit intertidal zones. They vary in size from small branched filaments to ribbon-like bodies (known as kelps) many metres long.
