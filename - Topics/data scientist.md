- A data scientist is someone who looks for patterns and trends in data sets. Data scientists create data models and algorithms to solve business problems or predict future outcomes that might impact a business. They carry out their work using technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, and business intelligence (BI) programs. A data scientist typically has advanced coding, analytical, and decision modeling skills and can interpret complicated charts and graphs. However, data scientists often work within teams so they can better understand business issues. For example, a data scientist might work with the marketing department to discover trends in customer data so marketers can create more successful campaigns.
