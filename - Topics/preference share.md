- A share in a company yielding a fixed rate of interest rather than a variable dividend. A preference share is an intermediate form of security between an ordinary share and a debenture. Preference shares usually confer some degree of ownership of the company; in the event of liquidation, they are paid off after loan capital but before ordinary share capital.
- Participating preference shares carry additional rights to dividends, such as a further share in the profits of the company, after the ordinary shareholders have received a stated percentage. See also PREFERRED ORDINARY SHARE.
