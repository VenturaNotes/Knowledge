- A technique used to grow microorganisms or cells continually in a particular phase of growth. For example, if a constant supply of cells is required, a cell culture maintained in the log phase is best; the conditions must therefore be continually monitored and adjusted accordingly so that the cells do not enter the stationary phase (see BACTERIAL GROWTH CURVE). Growth may also have to be maintained in a particular growth phase if an enzyme or chemical product is produced only during that phase.
