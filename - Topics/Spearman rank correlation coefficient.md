- A distribution-free statistic measuring the degree of monotone association between two variables defined by$$r=1-6 \sum_{i=1}^{N} d_{i}^{2} /\left(N\left(N^{2}-1\right)\right)$$where $N$ is the number of pairs of observations and $d$ is the difference in statistical ranks of the two variables in every pair.
