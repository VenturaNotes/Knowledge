- $n$. In psychometrics, the degree to which a test improves on decisions that can be made from existing information, such as the base rate of the attribute being measured and other measures that are available. The term is also used to denote the validity of a test arising from successive refinements or improvements of it in the light of experience or evidence, usually including the removal or replacement of test items that turn out to be problematic or that yield different results from the others.
