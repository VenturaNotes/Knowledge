- (biholomorphism) A bijection between two open subsets (see OPEN SET) of $\mathbb{C}$ is biholomorphic (or a biholomorphism) if both it and its inverse are holomorphic. This is synonymous with the map being a conformal equivalence. The definition can be further extended to Riemann surfaces. See Riemann mapping theorem.
