- $n$. (pl. miracidia) the first-stage larva of a parasitic fluke. Miracidia hatch from eggs released into water with the host's excreta. They have cilia and swim about until they reach a snail. The miracidia then bore into the snail's soft tissues and there continue their development as sporocysts.
