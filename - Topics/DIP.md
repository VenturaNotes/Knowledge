- (1) (dual in-line package) An integrated circuit encapsulated in a rectangular plastic or ceramic package with a row of metal legs down each of the long sides (see diagram). The legs are terminating pins. The number of terminations and hence the package size is a function of the number of external connections to the chip. The legs can either be soldered into holes in a printed circuit board or inserted into a chip socket.
