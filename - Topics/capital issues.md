- The main way in which new shares come into existence. Money to fund newly floated companies, or to finance the expansion of existing ones, can be obtained by selling newly issued shares to the public. New issues are regulated by the stock exchange; in particular, firms are required to provide potential investors with a prospectus giving information about the business's past results and forecasts of its future prospects. See also INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.
