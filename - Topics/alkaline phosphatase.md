- A membrane-bound glycoprotein enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of phosphoric acid esters under conditions of alkaline pH . In humans the blood levels of alkaline phosphatase are measured as part of the assessment of liver function; in the blood the enzyme also breaks down phosphates required for mineralization of bone. There are four distinct forms of the enzyme (see ISOZYME) in humans$\textemdash$intestinal, placental, germ cell, and liver/bone/kidney alkaline phosphatases$\textemdash$each encoded by different genes.
