- adj. n. (Of or relating to) any drug that alleviates parkinsonism or the pseudo-parkinsonian side-effects of neuroleptic drugs such as the phenothiazines. In particular, L-dopa or bromocriptine compensates for the shortfall of dopamine in the substantia nigra and striatum of the brains of people with Parkinson's disease; deprenyl inhibits the action of a monoamine oxidase enzyme that destroys cells in the substantia nigra in people with Parkinson's disease; the antiviral drug amantadine is believed to increase dopamine release; and anticholinergic drugs such as benztropine, biperiden, procyclidine, and trihexyphenidyl counteract the relative overabundance of acetylcholine in the striatum.
