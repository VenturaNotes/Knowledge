- $n$. One of the forms of physiological nystagmus, consisting of a random movement of the eyes through a visual angle of up to 5 minutes of arc (sixtieths of a degree). Such movements occur while an observer fixates an object and are necessary to prevent the visual image from disappearing, as an artificially stabilized retinal image does after about a second. See also microSACCADE, OCULAR TREMOR.
