- n. In statistics, a procedure whereby the significance level of a statistical test is adjusted in order to protect against Type I errors when multiple comparisons are being made. Thus if $10$ t tests need to be performed on a set of scores, a researcher may use a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of $.05 / 10=.005$ instead of the conventional .05 . This procedure is extremely conservative inasmuch as it may lead to Type II errors, but it is safe, easy to understand, and can be used with a wide variety of tests. A Bonferroni-corrected $t$ test is sometimes called simply a Bonferroni $t$ test or a modified LSD test. A Bonferronicorrected Mann-Whitney $U$ test is sometimes called a Bonferroni Mann-Whitney $U$ test, and so on. Compare Duncan's multiple range test, least-significant difference test, Newman-Keuls test, Scheff√© test, Tukey-HSD TEST. \[Named after the Italian mathematician Carlo Emilio Bonferroni (1892-1960) who, in 1935 and 1936, published inequalities on which the procedure is based]
