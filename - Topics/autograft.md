- $n$. a tissue graft taken from one part of the body and transferred to another part of the same individual. The repair of burns is often done by grafting on strips of skin taken from elsewhere on the body, usually the upper arm or thigh. Unlike allografts, autografts are not rejected by the body's immunity defences. See also SKIN GRAFT; TRANSPLANTATION.
