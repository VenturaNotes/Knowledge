- $n$. (pl. pelves) 
- (1) the bony structure formed by the hip bones, sacrum, and coccyx: the bony pelvis (see illustration overleaf). The hip bones are fused at the back to the sacrum to form a rigid structure that protects the organs of the lower abdomen and provides attachment for the bones and muscles of the lower limbs. The female pelvis may be one of four shapes (see illustration overleaf). In the android pelvis the cavity is funnel-shaped with a contracted outlet; the anthropoid pelvis is long, narrow, and oval. The classical shape, gynaecoid, has a transversely oval outlet and a roomy pelvic cavity; the platypelloid pelvis is wide and flattened at the brim, with the promontory of the sacrum pushed forward. 
- (2) the lower part of the abdomen. 
- (3) the cavity within the bony pelvis. 
- (4) any structure shaped like a basin, e.g. the expanded part of the ureter in the kidney (renal pelvis). $\textemdash$pelvic adj.
