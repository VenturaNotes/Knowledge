- (one-shot) A digital circuit that has only one stable output state. It is constructed in such a way that it may be triggered by an externally generated signal to produce a single pulse. The time duration of the pulse is specified by the choice of external components, usually a capacitor. Two forms of monostable are common:
	- (1) the triggered monostable where the pulse is timed from the leading edge of the triggering pulse. Once triggered this type cannot be triggered again until the time delay (plus recovery time) has elapsed.
	- (2) the re-triggerable monostable starts the timing interval again on the trailing edge of the trigger pulse. This can occur any number of times.
