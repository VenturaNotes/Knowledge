- (CMV) n. a member of the herpes group of viruses (see HERPESVIRUS). It commonly occurs in humans and normally produces symptoms milder than the common cold. However, in individuals whose immune systems are compromised (e.g. by cancer or AIDS) it can cause more severe effects (such as retinitis), and it has been found to be the cause of congenital impairment in infants born to women who have contracted the virus during pregnancy.
