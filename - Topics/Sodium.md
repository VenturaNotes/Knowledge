- $n$. a mineral element and an important constituent of the human body (average sodium content of the adult body is 4000 mmol ). Sodium controls the volume of extracellular fluid in the body and maintains the acid-base balance. It also helps maintain electrical potentials in the nervous system and is thus necessary for the functioning of nerves and muscles. Sodium is contained in most foods and is well absorbed, the average daily intake in the UK being $8.1 \mathrm{~g} /$ day. The amount of sodium in the body is controlled by the kidneys. An excess of sodium leads to the condition of hypernatraemia, which often results in oedema. This can be fatal in newborns, and is more likely to occur in formula-fed infants, particularly if the formula is made up at too high a concentration. Infants are at higher risk as they are less able to remove sodium from the body than adults. Sodium is also implicated in hypertension: a high-sodium diet is thought to increase the risk of hypertension in later life. The UK government target is for adults to consume less than $6 \mathrm{~g} /$day. Symbol: Na.
