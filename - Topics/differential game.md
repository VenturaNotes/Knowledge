- A game set in continuous time with the change in the state variable determined by the strategies of the two players. Let time be denoted by $t$ and the state of the system at time $t$ by $x(t)$. Assume there are two players. If player 1 chooses the strategy $u(t)$ and player 2 chooses strategy $v(t)$ then the change in the state, $\dot{x}(t)$, is governed by the differential equation $\dot{x}(t)=f(x(t), u(t), v(t))$. The pay-offs to the two players are determined by the state of the system. See also Optimal Control.
