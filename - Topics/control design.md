## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The design of a control unit. Control units may be designed using random logic or microprogramming. Microprogramming was well suited to the control of the complex sequences of register transfers required by CISC instruction sets. RISC processors with their emphasis on the rapid execution of simple instruction sets usually employ random logic control to optimize performance.
