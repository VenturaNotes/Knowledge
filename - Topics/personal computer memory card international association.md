- A body set up in 1989 whose members include hardware and chip manufacturers, software houses, and system integrators. The PCMCIA defined two specifications for add-in cards of credit-card size: PC card (formerly [[PCMCIA card]]) and its successor, ExpressCard. Cards can contain such peripherals as hard disks, modems, flash memory, or network interfaces. The association was dissolved in 2009.
