- (TRIPS) An agreement reached in 1995 as part of the Uruguay Round, concerning countries' respect for other countries' copyright, patents, and trademarks. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, which own most of these, were very keen on TRIPS; many less developed countries were very suspicious of it, but some of the newly industrialized countries, which are developing their own patents, supported it.
