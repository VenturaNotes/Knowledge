- (leadership continuum theory) A model of leadership that sees leadership style as a continuum varying from leader-centred (autocratic) to subordinate-centred (democratic). The type of leadership that is practical and desirable in any given situation will depend on three types of force: forces in the leader (e.g. self-confidence, personal philosophy); forces in the followers (e.g. experience, willingness to take responsibility); and forces in the situation (e.g. the complexity of the problem, time pressures).
