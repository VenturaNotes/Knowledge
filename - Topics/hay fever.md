- a form of allergy due to the pollen of grasses, trees, and other plants, characterized by inflammation of the membrane lining the nose and sometimes of the conjunctiva (see CONJUNCTIVITIS). The symptoms of sneezing, running or blocked nose, and watering eyes are due to histamine release and often respond to treatment with antihistamines. If the allergen is identified, it may be possible to undertake desensitization. Medical name: allergic rhinitis.
