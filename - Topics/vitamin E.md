## Source [^1]
- any of a group of chemically related fat-soluble compounds (tocopherols and tocotrienols) that have antioxidant properties and are thought to stabilize cell membranes by preventing oxidation of their unsaturated fatty acid components. The most potent of these is $\alpha$-tocopherol. Good sources of the vitamin are vegetable oils, eggs, margarine, and wholemeal cereals. It is fairly widely distributed in the diet and a deficiency is therefore unlikely. There is no set recommendation for dietary intake.
