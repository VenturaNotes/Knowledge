## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- any of a group of chemically related fat-soluble compounds (tocopherols and tocotrienols) that have antioxidant properties and are thought to stabilize cell membranes by preventing oxidation of their unsaturated fatty acid components. The most potent of these is $\alpha$-tocopherol. Good sources of the vitamin are vegetable oils, eggs, margarine, and wholemeal cereals. It is fairly widely distributed in the diet and a deficiency is therefore unlikely. There is no set recommendation for dietary intake.
## Source[^2]
- (tocopherol) A fat-soluble vitamin, consisting of several closely related compounds, that is the main antioxidant of cell membranes and other lipid-rich tissue components. Deficiency leads to a range of disorders in different species, including muscular dystrophy, liver damage, and infertility. Good sources are cereal grains and green vegetables. Vitamin E prevents the oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids in cell membranes by removing lipid peroxyl radicals, so maintaining their structure (see ANTIOXIDANTS).
