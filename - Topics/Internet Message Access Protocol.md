- IMAP allows users to access emails or other messages from multiple devices such as a phone, tablet, or desktop computer. Working with the email system (such as Outlook), users can read emails using IMAP without having to download or store messages on their device. This gives users the ability to check messages from different devices anywhere in the world. POP (Post Office Protocol) is the opposite of IMAP, as messages sent via POP can only be accessed while using the same device. It is important to know the difference when manually setting up a new email on a device.
