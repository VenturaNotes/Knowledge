## Source [^1]
- Distributed computing is a process that enables communication and coordination between several software systems or machines. Despite the use of more than one device, the goal is to create a comprehensive system that appears to work as a singular system instead of several different processes. Devices used in a distributed computing network include computers, containers, and physical servers. Each of these devices is able to communicate with the others to streamline a process and reach the same goal.
