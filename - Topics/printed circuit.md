## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A physical realization of an electronic circuit design in which the connections between the terminals of individual components are formed from copper conductors supported by a sheet of an insulating material such as fiberglass. The conductor pattern is normally printed and etched onto the sheet and components are then attached to the copper 'lands' by hand or dip soldering. The supporting sheet plus circuit is known as a [[printed circuit board]] (PCB).
- Double-sided and multilayer PCBs are commonly produced. These consist of insulating sheets (normally known as PCB laminate) with a circuit on each side, with interconnections possible between the two layers.
