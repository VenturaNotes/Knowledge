- (1) The total value of the physical capital of an enterprise or country, including inventories as well as fixed equipment. This can be measured in various ways: historical cost is what the equipment originally cost to buy; written-down value is historical cost of equipment minus deductions for aging and wear and tear in use; replacement cost is what it would cost to replace existing equipment with equivalent new items. Any of these may or may not be adjusted for inflation since the equipment was first acquired. The capital stock of an industry, region, or country is the sum of the capital stocks of enterprises in it.
- (2) The number of shares, including both common stock and preferred stock, that a company is authorized to issue by its corporate charter.
