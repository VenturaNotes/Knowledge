- (symbol: G) A prefix indicating a multiple of one billion, $10^{9}$, as in gigahertz and gigavolt. When the binary number system is used in a structure or process (as in semiconductor RAM or ROM) the prefix then indicates a multiple of $2^{30}$, i.e.$$1073741824,$$as in gigabyte and gigabit. The context usually clarifies which meaning is intended, although, being quite close numerically, the meanings are often considered more or less equivalent. See also BINARY PREFIXES.
