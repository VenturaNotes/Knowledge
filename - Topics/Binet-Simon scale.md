- $n$. The first standardized (2) intelligence test, constructed in 1905 by the French psychologists Alfred Binet (1857-1911) and Th√©odore Simon (1873-1961). It included items designed to measure ability to follow instructions, to exercise judgement, and to solve a wide variety of problems. The final version contained 54 items arranged in order of difficulty, from following the movement of a lighted match with the eyes, through pointing to named parts of the body and counting backwards from 20, to working out what time a clock face would show if the hour and minute hands swapped places. Also called the Binet scale, though this is unfair to Simon, who played a major part in its development. See also mental age, Stanford-Binet intelligence scale.
