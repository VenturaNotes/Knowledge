- $n$. A form of apparent movement, first described in 1915 by the German Gestalt psychologist Adolf Korte, that occurs when two stimuli quite close together are presented in an alternating pattern, the second being much brighter than the first. Under certain conditions relating to sizes of the stimuli and interstimulus interval, the visual illusion is created of the second stimulus moving in a reverse direction from its position towards the first stimulus. Also called delta motion . Compare ALPHA MOVEMENT, BETA MOVEMENT, GAMMA MOVEMENT.
