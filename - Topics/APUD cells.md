- cells that share the metabolic property of amine-precursor uptake and decarboxylation. They have a wide distribution, especially in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas, and their function is to synthesize and release polypeptides that serve as regulator peptides and neurotransmitters. They are often known as the diffuse neuroendocrine system.
