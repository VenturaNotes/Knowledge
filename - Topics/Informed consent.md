- the principle that requires clinicians to provide sufficient information to patients or potential research participants in order to render their consent lawful. How much information and of what kind is regarded as sufficient depends on the seriousness of what is proposed and on the understanding of those from whom consent is required.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. Voluntary agreement by a patient to undergo a medical treatment or procedure, or by a research participant or subject to take part in an experiment or other research study, given in full knowledge of the nature of the procedure and its potential risks and benefits. It is acknowledged in the ethical principles for research published by the American Psychological Association and the British Psychological Society that informed consent, while desirable, is sometimes either infeasible (as when the research participants lack the capacity to give it, through youth or mental disorder), or impractical (as when the nature of the investigation relies on deception). See also UlysSES CONTRACT.
