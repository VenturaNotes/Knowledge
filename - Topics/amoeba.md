- n. (pl. amoebae) any protozoan of jelly-like consistency and irregular and constantly changing shape. Found in water, soil and other damp environments, they move and feed by means of flowing extensions of the body (see PSEUDOPODIUM). Some amoebae cause disease in humans (see Acanthamoeba; Entamoeba). â€”amoebic adj.
## Source[^2]
- A genus of protists (see also protozoA) formerly placed in the phylum Rhizopoda but now, on the basis of molecular systematics, classified as amoebozoans. Amoeba spp. have lobe-shaped pseudopodia, which are used for locomotion and feeding and result in a constantly changing body shape (see AMOEBOID MOVEMENT). Most species are free-living in soil, mud, or water, where they feed on smaller protists and other single-celled organisms, but a few are parasitic. The best-known species is the much studied A. proteus.
