## Source [^1]
- WOA develops applications for the internet and is a "substyle" of service-oriented architecture (SOA). WOA develops applications in the following ways:
	- (1) It identifies resources. (For example, WOA uses a uniform resource identifier, or URI, to identify web pages.)
	- (2) It manipulates resources through representations. (WOA can use HTTP to retrieve communication data.)
	- (3) It can use Multipurpose Internet Messaging Extensions, or MIME, to make messages "self-descriptive" so the client can find data.
	- (4) It can use hyperlinks to separate a client from a URI structure.
	- (5) It keeps applications neutral.
