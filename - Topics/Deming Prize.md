Edwards Deming, one of the leading total quality management (TQM) theorists, who introduced the idea that quality control should be a strategic activity led by senior management. The prize is given to organizations or divisions of organizations that can demonstrate successful 'company-wide quality control', using statistical process control techniques. There is also a prize for individuals who have made an outstanding contribution to the study or development of TMQ.
