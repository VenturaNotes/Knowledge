- A business conducting activities in different industries with very little in common. See also CONGLOMERATE MERGER.
## Source[^2]
- A diverse group of companies, usually managed by a holding company. There is usually little integration and few transactions between each of the subsidiaries, often because their activities and products are unrelated. This form of business structure is generally disliked by investors because conglomerates may lack a clear strategic focus and the overall value of the group can undervalue the combined individual values of the operating subsidiaries.
