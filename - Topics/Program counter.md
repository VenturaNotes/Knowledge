## Source [^1]
- Current address register is another name for program counter
- A counting register that normally increments in each instruction cycle to obtain the program sequence (i.e. the sequence of instructions) from memory locations. This counter will have its contents changed by branch instructions to obtain the next instruction from the branch target. The program counter forms part of the processor status word; this enables subsequent restarting of an interrupted program
