- A trunk media gateway (TMG) is a device that connects a circuit-based trunk switch with a packet-based IP or ATM backbone network. It supports voice over internet protocol (VoIP) and/or voice over asynchronous transfer mode (VoATM). A TMG can avoid the tandem switch (Class 4) and manage the PSTN-to-packet network transition at the trunk level by connecting to the local or trunk exchange.
