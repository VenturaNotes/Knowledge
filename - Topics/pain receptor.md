- $n$. Any of the free nerve endings located throughout the body that function as sensory receptors, transmitting sensations of pain in response to noxious stimulation, one type (the monomodal nocireceptor) being a thinly myelinated delta fibre that responds to severe mechanical deformation, the other (the polymodal nocireceptor) being a C fibre that responds to mechanical deformation, excessive heat or cold, and irritant chemical stimulation, and is responsible for the axon reflex. In the epidermis and dermis of the skin and in the mucous membranes, any form of stimulation, if intense enough, can stimulate pain receptors, whereas in the viscera only severe mechanical deformation and certain chemicals are adequate stimuli for pain receptors. Referred pain arises only from stimulation of deep-lying pain receptors in viscera, joints, and muscles, and never from pain receptors in the skin. See also substance $P$.
