- $n$. the form in which carbohydrates are stored in many plants and a major constituent of the diet. Starch consists of linked glucose units and occurs in two forms, $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-amylose and amylopectin. In $\alpha$-amylose the units are in the form of a long unbranched chain; in amylopectin they form a branched chain. The presence of starch can be detected using iodine: $\alpha$-amylose gives a blue color with iodine; amylopectin a red color. Starch is digested by means of the enzyme amylase. See also DEXTRIN.
## Source[^2]
- A polysaccharide consisting of various proportions of two glucose polymers, amylose and amylopectin. It occurs widely in plants as a carbohydrate energy store, occurring as granules in chloroplasts and other plastids, especially in the storage cells of roots, tubers, seeds, and fruits. Starch is therefore a major energy source for animals. When digested it ultimately yields glucose. Starch granules are insoluble in cold water but disrupt if heated to form a gelatinous solution.
