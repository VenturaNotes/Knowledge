- $n$. the form in which carbohydrates are stored in many plants and a major constituent of the diet. Starch consists of linked glucose units and occurs in two forms, $\boldsymbol{\alpha}$-amylose and amylopectin. In $\alpha$-amylose the units are in the form of a long unbranched chain; in amylopectin they form a branched chain. The presence of starch can be detected using iodine: $\alpha$-amylose gives a blue color with iodine; amylopectin a red color. Starch is digested by means of the enzyme amylase. See also DEXTRIN.
