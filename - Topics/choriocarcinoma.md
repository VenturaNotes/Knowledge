- (chorionepithelioma) $n$. a rare malignant tumour of the placenta originating in the outer membrane (chorion) surrounding the fetus. Usually it is a complication of a hydatidiform mole, although it may follow a miscarriage or even a normal pregnancy. The tumour rapidly spreads to the lungs, but is usually very sensitive to chemotherapy. It produces high levels of beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG), which can be monitored as a tumour marker. See also GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC NEOPLASIA.
