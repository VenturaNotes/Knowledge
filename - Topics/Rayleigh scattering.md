- Scattering of electromagnetic radiation by molecules in which the frequency of the scattered radiation is unchanged. This type of scattering was analysed by Lord Rayleigh in his papers in the late 19th century, which showed that the blue colour of the sky is a result of this type of light scattering, with molecules of the atmosphere of the earth scattering light from the sun.
