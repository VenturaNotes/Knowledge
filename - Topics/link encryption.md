- The transfer of an encrypted message across a system where the message is decrypted and re-encrypted after each stage of its journey. Typically, link encryption is used in a switched communication network where the message is decrypted at each switching node to read the routing information prior to re-encryption and onward transmission via the appropriate switch outlet. Compare END-TO-END ENCRYPTION.
