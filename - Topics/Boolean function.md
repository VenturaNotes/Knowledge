- (logical function) A function in Boolean algebra. The function is written as an expression formed with binary variables (taking the value 0 or 1 ) combined by the dyadic and monadic operations of Boolean algebra, e.g.$$f=(x \wedge y) \vee\left(x^{\prime} \wedge z\right)$$For any particular values of its constituent variables, the value of the function is either 0 or 1 , depending on the combinations of values assigned to the variables. A Boolean function can be represented in a truth table. It can also be transformed into a logic diagram of logic gates. See also PRODUCT OF SUMS EXPRESSION, SUM OF PRODUCTS EXPRESSION.
