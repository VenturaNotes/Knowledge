- $n$. a measurement of the pressure within the bladder to assess filling and voiding phases of urination in a patient with incontinence. Two catheters are placed into the bladder, one for filling the bladder and the other (a cystometer) for recording pressure. Modern investigations also include measurement of urine flow, and the resultant bladder pressure/flow study (urodynamic investigation) provides useful information regarding bladder function.
