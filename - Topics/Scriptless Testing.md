- The term scriptless testing, also referred to as codeless testing, is used to describe a process of testing without using code. Scriptless testing tools reduce or eliminate the amount of scripting involved in creating tests using model, object, data, or keyword-driven approaches. Tests on user interfaces (UI), for example, can be run by people that are not proficient in writing scripts. This allows people with more design or application experience to run tests and examine user experience (UX).
