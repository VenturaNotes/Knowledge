- adj. denoting a disease that occurs when the patient's immune system is impaired by, for example, an infection, another disease, or drugs. The infecting organism, which is also described as opportunistic, rarely causes the disease in healthy persons. Opportunistic infections, such as Pneumocystis pneumonia and that caused by the MAI complex (see MyCObacterium), are common in patients with AIDS.
