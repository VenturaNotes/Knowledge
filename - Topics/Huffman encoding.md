- A (usually) binary encoding of the elements of a finite set, $A$,$$A=\left\{a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots, a_{n}\right\}$$where each element $a_{i}$ in $A$ has an assumed probability, $p_{i}$, of occurring in a message. The binary encoding satisfies the prefix property and is such that messages will have a minimum expected length. Thus an element $a_{i}$ with a high probability of occurring in a message is encoded as a short binary string while an element with a low probability of occurring is encoded with a longer string. See also SOURCE CODING.
