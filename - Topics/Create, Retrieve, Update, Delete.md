- CRUD (create, retrieve, update, delete) is an acronym that represents the four functions used to handle stored data in database applications. Create allows new database records to be made. Retrieve is for searching and reading data. Update permits users to change existing records. Delete allows unneeded data to be removed from a database. CRUD uses persistent storage. If the power goes out, data remains on the hard drive or disk.
