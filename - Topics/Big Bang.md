- (1) A shorthand expression for the view that reforms should be carried out as rapidly as possible. This is contrasted with gradualism, the view that major changes should be made gradually. These views clash in countries undertaking liberalization or structural transformation. The argument for rapid change is that it creates a sufficiently large group who have gained from change to make it politically irreversible, whereas gradual change encourages opposition, because the losers often suffer before the gainers benefit.
- (2) The major change to trading practice on the London Stock Exchange that took place in 1986 when fixed commissions were abolished in the City.

- The upheaval on the London Stock Exchange (LSE) when major changes in operation were introduced on 27 October 1986. The major changes enacted on that date were: (a) the abolition of LSE rules enforcing a dual-capacity system; (b) the abolition of fixed commission rates charged by stockbrokers to their clients. The measures were introduced by the LSE in return for an undertaking by the government (given in 1983) that they would not prosecute the LSE under the Restrictive Trade Practices Act. Since 1986 the Big Bang has also been associated with the globalization and modernization of the London securities market.
