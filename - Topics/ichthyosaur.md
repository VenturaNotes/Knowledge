- Any extinct aquatic reptile belonging to the order Ichthyosauria, which lived during the Mesozoic era (250-66 million years ago). The earliest forms resembled lizards with flippers and probably swam in an eel-like fashion. Their successors evolved to become progressively more fishlike, with thickened bodies, finlike fore and hind limbs, and crescent-shaped tails. Fossilized skeletal remains show that the eyes were unusually large and adapted for hunting in poor visibility. Ichthyosaurs typically lived on a diet of squid, and some species attained lengths of over 15 m.
