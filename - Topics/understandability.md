- The accounting principle that the financial information provided by a company should be such that its significance is capable of being perceived by a person with a reasonable knowledge of business and accounting and a willingness to study it with reasonable diligence. The information should not leave out anything material, but should not be so comprehensive that the main points of significance are obscured.
- The concept is defined in the Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland. It is also recognized in the International Accounting Standards Board's Conceptual Framework.
