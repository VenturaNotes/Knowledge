- (Münchhausen's syndrome) a very rare mental disorder, first described by Richard Asher in 1951, in which the patient persistently feigns symptoms in order to obtain invasive hospital treatment, especially surgery. The symptoms may be described in vivid detail, and in some cases injury may be deliberately self-inflicted in an attempt to give the appearance of authenticity to the claims being made. In Munchausen's syndrome by proxy the patient (usually a mother) presents false health information about someone else (usually her child) or inflicts harm on this other in order to attract medical attention. Munchausen's syndrome is now often referred to as factitious disorder imposed on self and Munchausen's syndrome by proxy as factitious disorder imposed on another. \[Baron von Münchhausen, a character in German literature loosely based on the German nobleman Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von Münchhausen (1720-97), who told exaggerated stories]
