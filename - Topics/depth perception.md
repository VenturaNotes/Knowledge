- $n$. The visual perception of three-dimensional space through monocular cues and binocular cues that are present in the two-dimensional images projected on to the retinas of the eyes. It is served by the magnocellular system, which is colour-blind (see isoluminant). The monocular depth cues are accommodation (1), aerial perspective, chiaroscuro, elevation in the visual field, interposition, linear perspective, monocular parallax, relative size, sfumato, and texture gradient. The binocular depth cues are ocular convergence and stereopsis. See also KINETIC DEPTH EFFECT, PICTORIAL DEPTH, REDUCTION SCREEN.
