- In marketing research, an empirically testable proposition made by a researcher about some characteristic of a population of interest. Typical hypotheses could be that for a particular population one method of advertising (e.g. TV) is more effective than another (e.g. the Internet) or that one brand of cereal is more popular in a selected area of the country than in other areas. In order to affirm or reject the hypothesis, a sample is selected from the population, data are collected and evaluated, and the sampling error is identified.
