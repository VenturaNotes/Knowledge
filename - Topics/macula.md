- n. (pl. maculae) a small anatomical area that is distinguishable from the surrounding tissue. The macula lutea is the yellow spot on the retina at the back of the eye, which surrounds the greatest concentration of cones (see FOVEA). Maculae occur in the saccule and utricle of the inner ear (see illustration). Tilting of the head causes the otoliths to bend the hair cells, which send impulses to the brain via the vestibular nerve. See also LABYRINTH.
