- Profits of a business which are neither paid out in taxes nor paid to the shareholders or owners. Undistributed profits are ploughed back into the business. While they may be kept as cash balances or marketable securities, they are usually invested in buying physical equipment, acquiring other companies, or extending trade credit to customers. They are a major source of finance for new investment in the economy.
