- A method of group decision-making. There are many voting mechanisms that differ in the number of votes each participant in the mechanism can cast, and in how these votes are aggregated to reach a decision. For example, the majority voting mechanism allocates each participant a single vote, and the alternative that receives the most votes is chosen. See also BORDA COUNT; COLLECTIVE CHOICE; PARADOX OF VOTING.
