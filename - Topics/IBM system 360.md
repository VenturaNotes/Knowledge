- IBM's third generation computer family that used essentially the same architecture to span a wide range of performance and price objectives. The common architecture permitted upward mobility of users to larger versions of the same machine when their workload grew. Programs written for a smaller version of the 360 would run unchanged on the larger machines. Many of the principles embodied in the 360 operating systems were used in later IBM mainframes.
