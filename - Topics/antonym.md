- $n$. A word that has the opposite meaning to another word, such as high, which is an antonym of low. Some authorities, notably the British linguist John Lyons (born 1932), reserve the term for graded antonyms, such as the example just given, in which degrees of difference exist, and refer to ungraded antonyms$\textemdash$words that are either/or opposites, such as male and female, or single and married$\textemdash$as complementaries. See also ANTONYM TEST. Compare SYNONYM. antonymous adj. antonymy $n$. The relationship between words that are antonyms. \[From Greek anti against + onoma a name]
