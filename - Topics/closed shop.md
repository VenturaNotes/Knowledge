- A method of running a computing facility such that the design, development, writing, testing, and running of programs is carried out by specialist computing staff and not by the originators of the problem. Closed shop operation is the operation of a computing system, excluding terminals, by specialist computer operators and not by other computing staff or computer users. Compare OPEN SHOP.

- Any organization in which there is an agreement between the employers and a trade union that only members of that union will be taken on as employees. Under the Trade Union and Labor Relations (Consolidation) Act, all employees are free to join a trade union or not, as they wish. If an employer takes action, short of dismissal, against an employee to enforce membership of a union, the employee can complain to an employment tribunal, which can order the employer to pay him compensation. Dismissal for failure to belong to a trade union is automatically unfair (see UNFAIR DISMISSAL). A union that attempts to enforce a closed shop by industrial action has no immunity from legal action.
