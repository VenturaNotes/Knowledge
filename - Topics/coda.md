- (1) A concluding passage of a musical composition, dance, or other work, separate from the basic structure of the work. 
- (2) The consonant at the end of a syllable, if one exists. The main part of a syllable is almost invariably a vowel, and if nothing follows it, as in all Japanese syllables, then the vowel is said to have zero coda. In English up to four consonants can be present in a coda, as in the word sixths.
- \[From Latin cauda a tail]
