- A system of accounting in which revenue is recognized when it is earned and expenses are recognized as they are incurred. Accrual accounting is a basic accounting concept used in the preparation of the profit and loss account and balance sheet of a business. It differs from cash accounting, which recognizes transactions when cash has been received or paid. In preparing financial statements for an accounting period using accrual accounting, there will inevitably be some estimation and uncertainty in respect of transactions.
