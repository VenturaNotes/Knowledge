- Literally translated from Latin: let the buyer beware. This summarizes the principle that the buyer has to bear the risk of quality of their purchase. Considered as a legal principle, this is inconsistent with much modern legislation and many regulations designed to promote public health and safety by protecting buyers, who cannot reasonably be expected to be experts on all the products they purchase.
## Source[^2]
- (Latin: let the buyer beware) A maxim implying that the purchaser of goods must take care to ensure that they are free from defects of quality, fitness, or title, i.e. that the risk is borne by the purchaser and not by the seller. If the goods turn out to be defective, the purchaser has no remedy against the seller. The rule does not apply if the purchaser is unable to examine the goods, if the defects are not evident from a reasonable examination, or if the seller has behaved fraudulently. Some measure of protection for the unwary purchaser is afforded by a number of statutes, including the Unfair Contract Terms Act 1977, the Sale of Goods Act 1979, and the Consumer Protection Act 1987.
