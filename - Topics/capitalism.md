## Source [^1]
- The economic system based on private ownership of property and private enterprise. Under this system all, or a major proportion of, economic activity is undertaken by private profit-seeking individuals or organizations, and land and other material means of production are largely privately owned. Under capitalism parts of the economy may be in public ownership. The government may impose certain regulations on the activities of the private sector regarding public health and safety, enforcement of competition, and protection of the environment. Such regulation, however, typically has a form of restrictions: the rules lay down what individuals or firms may not do, but initiative about what is done within these rules is decentralized.
## Source[^2]
- An economic system in which the factors of production are privately owned and individual owners of capital are free to make use of it as they see fit; in particular, for their own profit. In this system the market and the profit mechanism will play a major role in deciding what is to be produced, how it is to be produced, and who owns what is produced. See also FREE COMPETITION; PRIVATE ENTERPRISE.
