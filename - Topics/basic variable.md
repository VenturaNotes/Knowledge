	- Basic variables are identified by the column that has a [[pivot]]
	- Columns 1 and 2 have pivots so $x_1$ and $x_2$ are basic variables
	- #comment This is an [[augmented matrix]] representation where there is no visible dividing line between the coefficients and solution set. Three is only 1 [[free parameter|free variable]] which is $x_3$ from column 3.
