- The zone of tropical forests with high rainfall. The rainforest is of concern to environmentalists because of its role as a source of biodiversity, and as a sink for large volumes of carbon dioxide. Scientific evidence suggests that the destruction of rainforests may lead to a rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide and thus to more greenhouse gases and global warming. Destruction also causes severe erosion, and increased run-off of rain leading to flooding downstream on rivers draining rainforest areas.
