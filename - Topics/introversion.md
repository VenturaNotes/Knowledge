People high in introversion (introverts), as measured by questionnaires and psychological tests, tend to have a small circle of friends, like to persist in activities once they have started, and are highly susceptible to permanent conditioning. Introversion was first described by Carl Jung as a tendency to distancing oneself from others, to philosophical interests, and to reserved defensive reactions. Compare EXTROVERSION. 
- (2) a turning inwards of a hollow organ (such as the uterus) on itself.
