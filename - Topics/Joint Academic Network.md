- The UK network that links all Universities and Research Council sites. It was formed by amalgamating a number of separate networks, and formally constituted as a single system in 1984. The name was at one time used for some other networks, all of which have ceased to operate, and is now used solely for the UK Academic Network that is operated by JANET(UK). See also SuperJANET.
