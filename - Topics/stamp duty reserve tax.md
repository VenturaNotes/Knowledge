- (SDRT) A tax levied on the transaction when a shareholding is transferred without a document, or when the document is kept outside the UK. The majority of transactions on UK exchanges are now electronic and 'paperless'. Like stamp duty, stamp duty reserve tax is charged on the consideration given, not on the market value of the shareholding.
