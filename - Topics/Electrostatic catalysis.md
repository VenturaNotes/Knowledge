## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A type of [[catalysis]] where a chemical reaction is accelerated by the stabilization of a transition state through electrostatic interactions with charged groups within the active site of an enzyme
- Using the attraction or repulsion of charges to facilitate the reaction process
	- This is a key mechanism in many biological reactions where enzymes utilize strategically charged amino acids to lower the energy barrier of a reaction
### Mechanism
- The [[active site]] of an enzyme contains specific arrangements of charged amino acids that can interact with the charges on a substrate molecule, stabilizing the high-energy transition state and allowing the reaction to proceed more readily
### Types of electrostatic interactions
- These interactions can include ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole interactions, and even hydrophobic interactions, all contributing to the overall stabilization of the transition state
### Importance in enzymes
- Electrostatic catalysis is a crucial mechanism in many enzymatic reactions, as it allows for precise control over the reaction pathway by strategically positioning charged residues within the active site

## Source[^2]
- Occurs when the enzyme active site stabilizes the transition state of the recation by forming electrostatic interactions with the substrate.
- The electrostatic interactions can be ionic, ionic-dipole, dipole-dipole, or hydrophobic interactions
