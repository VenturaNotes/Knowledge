- (identification key) A means of identifying a specimen organism by selecting from a series of choices relating to external features. Each stage in the key presents several character descriptions (two in a dichotomous key); each description is followed by a direction to another stage in the key. Selection of the character that matches the specimen leads to another stage, with another two choices, and so on until the specimen is identified.
