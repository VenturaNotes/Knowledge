## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A technique used in the production and field testing of complex logic systems, in which a signal of short duration is injected into the output of an element forcing it to the desired state regardless of any signals that would otherwise define its state. This technique simplifies testing and reduces the need for additional logic purely for test purposes. It must be used carefully if damage is to be avoided.
