- Virtual selling refers to the processes and technologies that allow salespeople to communicate with customersÂ remotely. It can include both synchronous communication (communication that happens in real time, such as a phone call) and asynchronous communication (communication that happens over a period of time, such as a series of emails). These communications might replace face-to-face sales conversations.
