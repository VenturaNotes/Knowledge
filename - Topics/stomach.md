- $n$. a distensible saclike organ that forms part of the alimentary canal between the oesophagus (gullet) and the duodenum (see illustration overleaf). It communicates with the former by means of the lower oesophageal sphincter (LOS), or cardiac sphincter, and with the latter by the pyloric sphincter. The stomach lies just below the diaphragm, to the right of the spleen and partly under the liver. Its function is to continue the process of digestion that begins in the mouth. Gastric juice, secreted by gastric glands in the mucosa, contains hydrochloric acid and the enzyme pepsin, which contribute to chemical digestion. This $\textendash$ together with the churning action of the muscular layers of the stomach $\textendash$ reduces the food to a semiliquid partly digested mass that passes on to the duodenum.

## Source[^2]
- The portion of the vertebrate alimentary canal between the oesophagus and the small intestine. It is a muscular organ, capable of dramatic changes in size and shape, in which ingested food is stored and undergoes preliminary digestion. Cells lining the stomach produce gastric juice, which is thoroughly mixed with the food by muscular contractions of the stomach. The resultant acidic partly digested food mass (chyme) is discharged into the duodenum through the pyloric sphincter for final digestion and absorption. Some herbivorous animals (see RUMINANTIA) have multichambered stomachs from which food is regurgitated, rechewed, and swallowed again.
