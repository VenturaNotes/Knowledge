## Source [^1]
- The intermediate formed when a substrate molecule interacts with the active site of an enzyme. Following the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex, the substrate molecule undergoes a chemical reaction and is converted into a new product. Various mechanisms for the formation of enzyme-substrate complexes have been suggested, including the induced-fit model and the lock-and-key mechanism.
