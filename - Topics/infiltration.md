- (1) the abnormal entry of a substance (infiltrate) into a cell, tissue, or organ. Examples of infiltrates are blood cells, cancer cells, fat, starch, or calcium and magnesium salts. Infiltration can occur when a vein is damaged and the fluid being infused continues to leak out and accumulate in the surrounding tissue (also known as 'tissuing'). This can result in inflammation. 
- (2) the injection of a local anaesthetic solution into the tissues to cause local anaesthesia. Infiltration anaesthesia is routinely used to anaesthetize upper teeth to allow dental procedures to be carried out.
