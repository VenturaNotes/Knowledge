- A mission statement is a short statement that outlines an organization's vision, mission, and values. A mission statement should clearly answer what the purpose of the organization is, what issues they seek to solve in the world, and how their values guide their operations. A mission statement is important because it communicates to an organization's workforce, community, and external stakeholders what their organization stands for. Typically, a business's mission statement will not change overtime, unless the company undergoes a drastic remodel.
