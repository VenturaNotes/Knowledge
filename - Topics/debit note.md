- A document sent by an organization to a person showing that the recipient is indebted to the organization for the amount shown in the debit note. Debit notes are rare as invoices are more regularly used; however, a debit note might be used when an invoice would not be appropriate, e.g. for some form of inter-company transfer other than a sale of goods or services.
