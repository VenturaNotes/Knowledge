- A standardized test for establishing the throughput of office printers. The familiar ratings of characters per second, lines per minute, etc., cannot be relied upon to give a true indication of the throughput achievable in a real application. A set of benchmark tests agreed by a group of European printer manufacturers define standard letter, spreadsheet, and graphic printouts and the way in which the task is timed. These tests were standardized as ECMA 132 and have since been superseded by ISO 10561.
