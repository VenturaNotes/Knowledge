- Abbreviation for small or medium-sized enterprise. Although the term is very widely used, there is no standard definition of an SME based on e.g. net worth, turnover, profits, or number of employees. In the UK the terms small company and medium-sized company are officially defined for accounting purposes, but different criteria are employed for corporation tax and to determine eligibility for various tax allowances and government schemes. Banks and insurance companies also have their own definitions. For the purpose of its business support programme, the EU has defined an SME as an entity with fewer than 250 employees, an annual turnover of no more than $€ 50$ million, and a net worth of no more than $€ 43$ million.
