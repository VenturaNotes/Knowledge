- A class of crustaceans comprising some 8000 known species. Ostracods are typically small (mostly $<1 \mathrm{~mm}$ to 2 cm ), with short oval bodies enclosed in a pair of hinged valves forming a carapace and resembling a tiny mussel, hence their common name of 'mussel shrimp'. The head bears five pairs of appendages, with another 1-3 pairs on the body. Most live in sediments on the floor of lakes or oceans.
