- $n$. inflammation of the stomach and intestine. It is usually due to acute viral or bacterial infection or to the ingestion of toxins in contaminated foods (see FOOD POISONING). Clinical symptoms are vomiting, diarrhoea, and fever. The illness usually lasts 3-5 days. Fluid loss is sometimes severe, especially at the extremes of age, and intravenous fluid replacement may be necessary. Viral or viral-type organisms (e.g. the norovirus) are common causes of highly infectious gastroenteritis and, unlike bacterial pathogens, can be spread by aerosol or minimal contact and not necessarily by the faeco-oral route.
