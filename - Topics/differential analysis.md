- (incremental analysis) An assessment of the impact on costs and revenues of specific management decisions. Such an analysis will focus on identifying the differential (or incremental) cash flows, i.e. those costs or revenues that will change as a result of a specific decision. In decision making, the differential costs are the only relevant costs. See also OUT-OF-POCKET COSTS.
