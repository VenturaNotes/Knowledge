## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A small element of real speech that is linguistically significant. The transitions between phonemes are acoustically but not linguistically significant. Phonemes may be used by means of concatenation to produce artificial speech. The particular problem with phoneme concatenation is how to actually perform the join since fluent speech requires fluent transitions. Diphones are the elements of speech between the centres of adjacent phonemes; they include the transitions, and are more useful for speech synthesis.
