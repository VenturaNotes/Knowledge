## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A small element of real speech that is linguistically significant. The transitions between phonemes are acoustically but not linguistically significant. Phonemes may be used by means of concatenation to produce artificial speech. The particular problem with phoneme concatenation is how to actually perform the join since fluent speech requires fluent transitions. Diphones are the elements of speech between the centers of adjacent phonemes; they include the transitions, and are more useful for speech synthesis.

- $n$. A basic speech sound, with an average duration of 70 to 80 milliseconds at normal speaking rate, distinguishing one word from another in a given language, although it may have various phonetically distinct articulations, called allophones, that are regarded as functionally identical by native speakers of the language. Phonemes are defined by the distinctive features that allow minimal pairs in a language to be distinguished. See also neutralization, phone. Compare kineme. phonemic adj. \[From Greek phonema a sound or utterance, from phone a voice or sound]
