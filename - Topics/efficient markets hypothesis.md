- A central theory of modern finance holding that transactors in financial markets cannot make abnormal returns on the basis of exploiting information, since market prices incorporate all available information. The US economist Eugene Fama has defined three categories of market efficiency: weak-form efficiency, in which only historical information is incorporated into the market prices; semi-strongform efficiency, in which all publicly available information, past or present, is incorporated; and strong-form efficiency, in which all public or private information is incorporated. See also ACTIVE MANAGEMENT; ANOMALY.

- The theory that where assets are traded in organized markets, prices take account of all available information, so that it is impossible to predict whether some assets will give better risk-adjusted returns than others. This cannot be predicted because it depends on news, that is, information which is not yet available, and cannot be deduced from information which is available. There are several variants of the efficient markets hypothesis. Weak-form efficiency asserts that it is not possible to use historical share prices to construct a trading strategy that yields excess returns. Semi-strong efficiency states that excess returns cannot be earned on the basis of public information. Strong-form efficiency states that excess returns cannot be earned by trading on the basis of private information. Empirical evidence seems to support semi-strong efficiency as a description of markets.
