- (Chrysomonada) A large phylum (or group, i.e. the chrysophytes) of mostly freshwater photosynthetic protists, including the golden, or golden-brown, algae. Now classified as stramenopiles, they possess carotenoid pigments (responsible for their colour), in addition to chlorophylls. Their main storage products are oils and the polysaccharide chrysolaminarin. Most chrysophytes are unicellular, with two unequal-sized flagella, but some form colonies or are filamentous; one group of marine chrysophytes construct tests of silica. Mixotrophic species can consume small prey as well as performing photosynthesis.
