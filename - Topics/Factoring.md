### Factoring Trinomial with 2 Variables
- $$ \begin{align*} 8x^2 - 6xy - 9y^2 &&\text{Given} \\8x^2 \textcolor{hotpink}{- 12xy + 6xy} - 9y^2 && \text{Find factors of \textcolor{red}{ac} and addends of \textcolor{red}{b}} \\ 4x(2x-3y) + 3y(2x-3y) && \text{Factor out terms} \\(4x +3y)(2x-3y) &&\text{Factor by grouping} \end{align*}  $$
## Original
### Shortcut Method #1 (Divide by x Term)
- $$ \begin{align*} 8x^2 - 6xy -9y^2 && \text{Given} \\ \textcolor{hotpink}{-12xy \text{ and }6xy} \text{ are factors of ac that work} && \text{Find factors} \\\frac{-12xy}{8x^2} \to \frac{-3y}{2x} \to (2x -3y) &&\text{Divide by x term} \\\frac{6xy}{8x^2} \to \frac{3y}{4x} \to (4x +3y) \\(2x-3y)(4x+3y) && \text{Solution} \end{align*}  $$
### Shortcut Method #2 (Divide by y Term)
- $$ \begin{align*} 8x^2 - 6xy -9y^2 && \text{Given} \\ \textcolor{hotpink}{-12xy \text{ and }6xy} \text{ are factors of ac that work} && \text{Find factors} \\\frac{-12xy}{-9y^2} \to \frac{4x}{3y} \to (3y +4x) &&\text{Divide by y term} \\\frac{6xy}{-9y^2} \to \frac{2x}{-3y} \to (-3y +2x) \\(2x-3y)(4x+3y) && \text{Solution} \end{align*}  $$

- The buying of the trade debts of a manufacturer, assuming the task of debt collection and accepting the credit risk, thus providing the manufacturer with working capital. With service factoring involves collecting the debts, assuming the credit risk, and passing on the funds as they are paid by the buyer. With service plus finance factoring involves paying the manufacturer up to $90 \%$ of the invoice value immediately after delivery of the goods, with the balance paid after the money has been collected. This form of factoring is clearly more expensive than with service factoring. In either case the factor, which may be a bank or finance house, has the right to select its debtors.
