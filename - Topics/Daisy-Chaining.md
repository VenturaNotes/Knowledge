- In the technology industry, daisy-chaining refers to attaching devices in a sequence. Typically, this is done with equipment such as computer monitors to increase productivity. For instance, three monitors may be daisy-chained together so that one screen displays data, another is used for research, and a final one can be used to record the information.
