- A technique used in genetic engineering for introducing particular changes to the base sequence of a gene at a specific site. It allows precise and specific mutations to be made and is done, for example, to modify the amino-acid sequence of the protein expressed by the gene to investigate how such a change affects the protein's structure and function, or in protein engineering. First, the gene of interest is cloned and made available as single-stranded DNA$\textemdash$a widely used vector for this purpose is the bacteriophage M13. Then an artificial oligonucleotide, containing perhaps 20-30 nucleotides, is constructed containing the desired change in base sequence. This is allowed to hybridize with the complementary (apart from the mutation site) single-stranded DNA and is then extended at either end by the enzyme DNA polymerase using the single-stranded DNA as template. The two strands, each with their vector, are then separated and cloned, and clones containing the mutant gene are selected. Compare GENOME EDITING.
