- (1) Any of the shades of red, green, or blue that can be mixed equally to form white or in different proportions to match all other spectral colors and also certain non-spectral colors such as purple. The wavelengths often used to define the primary colors are 670,535, and 470 nanometres respectively. Also called an additive primary.

- (2) Any of the complementary colors of red, green, and blue, namely green-blue (cyan), deep bluish purple (magenta), and yellow respectively, that can be subtracted from white light, equally to form black, or in different proportions (usually by mixing pigments) to match any other spectral color. Also called a subtractive primary. 
- (3) Any of the four colors red, yellow, green, or blue that are basic to the processing of color in the visual system and that are perceived as being basic or fundamental, the wavelengths often used to define them being 670, 589, 535, and 470 nanometres respectively. Also called a principal color or a psychological primary. US primary color. See also Bezold-Brücke Phenomenon.
