## Source[^2]
- (acylglycerol) A fatty-acid ester of glycerol. Esterification can occur at one, two, or all three hydroxyl groups of the glycerol molecule producing monoglycerides, diglycerides, and triglycerides respectively. Triglycerides are the major constituent of fats and oils found in living organisms. Alternatively, one of the hydroxyl groups may be esterified with a phosphate group forming a phosphoglyceride (see PHOSPHOLIPID) or a sugar forming a glycolipid.
