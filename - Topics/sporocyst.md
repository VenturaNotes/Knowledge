- $n$. the second-stage larva of a parasitic fluke, found within the tissues of a freshwater snail. A sporocyst develops from a first stage larva (see MIRACIDIUM) and gives rise either to the next larval stage (see REDIA) or daughter sporocysts. The latter develop directly into the final larval stage (see CERCARIA) without the intermediate redia stage.
