- $n$. an inflammatory disease that affects the muscular walls of the arteries. It may be part of a connective-tissue disease or it may be due to an infection, such as syphilis. The affected vessels are swollen and tender and may become blocked. Temporal (or giant-cell) arteritis occurs in the elderly and most commonly affects the arteries of the scalp. The patient complains of severe headache, and double vision or scalp tenderness may be present; blindness may result from thrombosis of the arteries to the eyes. Treatment with steroid medication is rapidly effective.
