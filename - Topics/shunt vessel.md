- A blood vessel that links an artery directly to a vein, allowing the blood to bypass the capillaries in certain areas. Shunt vessels can control blood flow by constriction and dilation. In endotherms the shunt vessels dilate in response to cold, thereby cutting off the blood flow to the extremities and preventing heat loss.
