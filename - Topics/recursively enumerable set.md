- A subset $A$ of a set $B$ is said to be recursively enumerable, relative to $B$, if there is an effective procedure that, given an element $b$ in $B$, will output 'yes' if and only if $b$ is an element of $A$. If $b$ is not in $A$ then, in general, the procedure will never terminate. This is a weaker notion than that of a recursive set. A set can be recursively enumerable without being recursive. The set $A$ is also said to be semidecidable or semicomputable.
- The set of Ada programs that terminates (for a given input) is recursively enumerable (with respect to the class of all Ada programs) but it is not recursive.
