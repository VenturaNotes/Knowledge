- A performance improvement plan (PIP), sometimes called a performance action plan, is a document used to help underperforming employees succeed. A PIP will identify areas where improvements need to be made in performance, skills, and training. It will also clarify all goals the employee needs to meet within a certain period or be subject to disciplinary action (e.g., suspension, demotion, termination).
