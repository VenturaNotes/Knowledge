- (unquoted securities) Securities (usually equities) in companies that are not on an official stock-exchange list. They are therefore not required to satisfy the standards set for listing (see LISTED SECURITY). Unlisted securities are usually issued in relatively small companies and their shares usually carry a high degree of risk. In London, unlisted securities are traded on the Alternative Investment Market. Other exchanges have similar markets.
