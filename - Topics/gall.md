- (cecidium) An abnormal growth of a plant tissue or organ elicited by a foreign organism. Galls can take a wide variety of forms, but most frequently occur as swellings or pits in stems, roots, leaves, and buds. Organisms responsible for their formation include bacteria, viruses, fungi, nematodes, mites, and insects. The gall structure can be quite complex, with several distinct cell layers, or relatively simple and undifferentiated, but is typically very distinct from surrounding normal tissue and often is characteristic of the eliciting organism. It can involve cell enlargement (hypertrophy) and/or cell proliferation (hyperplasia). The mechanisms underlying gall formation are known in only a few cases. The bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens, which is responsible for crown galls, induces a genetic change in infected host tissue by transfer of a plasmid bearing tumor-forming genes. Insects may secrete substances in their saliva that induce gall formation, or in some cases may transmit viruses or other genetic carriers that affect the plant genome.
