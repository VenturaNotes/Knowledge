- A disagreement between members of a distribution channel. Horizontal channel conflict can occur among retailers, if one retailer feels another is competing too vigorously through pricing or is using advertising to invade unauthorized sales territory. Vertical conflict occurs between retailers and their suppliers when either side feels dominated by the other. Conflict can arise when a manufacturer creates a new channel, such as direct e-commerce.
