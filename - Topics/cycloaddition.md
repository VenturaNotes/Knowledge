- A reaction in which two or more unsaturated compounds form a cyclic adduct or in which a cyclic compound is formed by addition between unsaturated parts of the same molecule. In cycloaddition, there is no net reduction in bond multiplicity. The Diels-Alder reaction is an example. Cycloadditions may be stepwise reactions or may be pericyclic reactions.
