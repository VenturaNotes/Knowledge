- A letter of intent (LOI) is a document that outlines the broad strokes of a business agreement between corporations. A letter of intent cannot be legally enforced, but rather serves as a clarification of mutual understanding between business entities. LOIs often include certain requirements that are to be outlined in a business contract; however, they may be subject to change once negotiations are made during the contracting process. This includes the timeline in which a business contract must be signed before it is voided, the stipulations of the business agreement, and what parties are involved in the deal itself. Businesses that wish to partner with each other typically draw up a letter of intent to protect their corporate interests before an actual business contract is signed.
## Source[^2]
- A letter in which a person formally sets out his or her intentions to do something, such as signing a contract in certain circumstances, which are often specified in detail in the letter. The letter does not constitute either a contract or a promise to do anything, but it does indicate the writer's serious wish to pursue the course set out.
