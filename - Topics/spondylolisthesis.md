- $n$. a forward shift (slippage) of one vertebra upon another, due to a defect in the bone or in the joints that normally bind them together. This may be congenital or develop after injury. The vertebral displacement is most likely to occur in the lumbar (lower back) or cervical (neck) regions of the backbone. The majority of cases in which pain is present are treated with rest, analgesics, and NSAIDs. In a small minority, showing severe disability, pressure on nerve roots, or slippage of more than $50 \%$, surgical fusion may be required.
