- $n$. an inflammatory condition of the skin caused by outside agents (compare ECZEMA, an endogenous disease in which such agents do not play a primary role, although some use the two terms interchangeably). Irritant contact dermatitis may occur in anyone who has sufficient contact with such irritants as acids, alkalis, solvents, and (especially) detergents. It is the commonest cause of occupational dermatitis in hairdressers, nurses, cooks, etc. (See also NAPKIN RASH.) In allergic contact dermatitis skin changes resembling those of eczema develop as a delayed (type IV) reaction to a particular allergen, which may be present at low concentrations. Common examples include nickel dermatitis (from costume jewellery, clothing fasteners, zips, etc.) and fragrance allergy (from toiletries, deodorants, perfumes, etc.). Treatment of dermatitis depends on identifying the allergen by patch testing and removing the cause, which is not always possible.
- Dermatitis herpetiformis is an uncommon very itchy rash with symmetrical blistering, especially on the knees, elbows, buttocks, and shoulders. It is associated with gluten sensitivity and responds well to treatment with dapsone or a gluten-free diet.
