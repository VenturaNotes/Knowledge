- Technical progress where with any given factor proportions the average and marginal products of all factors increase in the same proportion. Thus if $Y=F(K, L)$, where $Y$ is output, $K$ is labour, and $L$ is capital, and the function $F(K, L)$ has constant returns to scale, output after Hicks-neutral technical progress where the productivity of each factor rises to $\lambda>1$ times its former level is given by$$Y^{*}=F(\lambda K, \lambda L)=\lambda F(K, L)=\lambda Y$$
