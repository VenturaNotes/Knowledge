It is administered by mouth or injection and may cause serious side-effects such as stomach ulcers and bleeding, nervous and hormone disturbances, muscle and bone damage, and eye changes.
## Source[^2]
- A corticosteroid that is itself biologically inactive and is formed naturally in the adrenal gland from the active hormone cortisol, which is structurally very similar to it. Cortisone is reconverted to the active hormone by metabolism in the liver and other organs. It may be administered therapeutically as an inactive precursor (prodrug) of cortisol.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A corticosteroid hormone secreted by the adrenal cortex that suppresses inflammation and promotes carbohydrate formation. See also DHEA. \[From corti(co)s(ter)one]
