- (Fd) A protein containing iron associated with sulphur that is a carrier molecule in the electron transport chain in photosynthesis. It accepts electrons from photosystem I and passes them on to NADP reductase, which donates them for the reduction of NADP$^{+}$(see photOPHOSPHORYlation; PHOTOSYSTEMS I AND II). Ferredoxin also takes part in nitrogen fixation in plants.
