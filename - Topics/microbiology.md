## Source[^2]
- The scientific study of microorganisms (e.g. bacteria, viruses, and fungi). Originally this was directed towards their effects (e.g. in causing disease and decay), but during the 20th century the emphasis shifted to their physiology, biochemistry, and genetics. Microbes are now recognized as important vehicles for the study of biochemical and genetic processes common to all living organisms, and their rapid growth enables their laboratory culture in large numbers for studies in genetics and for biotechnological applications.
