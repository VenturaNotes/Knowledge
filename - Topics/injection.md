- The shorthand way of writing one-to-one functions is "1-1"

- A function is "one-to-one" if for every x-value there is only one y-value
- Example
	- $y = x^2$ where $x \ge 0$ 
		- is a one-to-one function as there is only one x-value for every corresponding y-value
		- Adding a condition like $x \ge 0$ is typically called restriction of the domain. We restrict the domain to $x \ge 0$ so that the function is one-to-one[^3]
## Source[^3]
- A function f: $A \to B$ is one-to-one if different elements in the [[Domain (Math)|domain]] A map to different elements in the [[codomain]] B
	- $f : A \to B$ is read as "f is a function from A to B"
		- A is the domain, the set of inputs
		- B is the codomain, the set of all potential outputs (not necessarily all achieved outputs)
- Formally
	- $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ $\implies$ $x_1 = x_2$ 
		- No two distinct elements of A can map to the same element in B
		- If the outputs are equal, then the inputs must be equal. So $f$ assigns unique outputs to unique inputs
- Example
	- $f(x) = 2x$ for x $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$ is one-to-one, because each input x gives a unique output

- The term injective is more commonly used in formal mathematical writing or advanced contexts. The term one-to-one is often used in introductory mathematics or more informal discussions
- Different from a [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]]

## Source[^5]
- A function $f: S \to T$ is one-to-one if, whenever $s_1$ and $s_2$ are distinct elements of S, their images $f(s_1)$ and $f(s_2)$ are distinct elements of T. Equivalently, $f$ is one-to-one if $f(s_1) = $f(s_2)$ implies that $s_1 = s_2$. Synonymous with injective
