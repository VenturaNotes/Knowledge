- The shorthand way of writing one-to-one functions is "1-1"

- A function is "one-to-one" if for every x-value there is only one y-value
- Example
	- $y = x^2$ where $x \ge 0$ 
		- is a one-to-one function as there is only one x-value for every corresponding y-value
		- Adding a condition like $x \ge 0$ is typically called restriction of the domain. We restrict the domain to $x \ge 0$ so that the function is one-to-one[^3]
## Source[^3]
- A function f: $A \to B$ is one-to-one if different elements in the [[Domain (Math)|domain]] A map to different elements in the [[codomain]] B
	- $f : A \to B$ is read as "f is a function from A to B"
		- A is the domain, the set of inputs
		- B is the codomain, the set of all potential outputs (not necessarily all achieved outputs)
- Formally
	- $f(x_1) = f(x_2)$ $\implies$ $x_1 = x_2$ 
		- No two distinct elements of A can map to the same element in B
		- If the outputs are equal, then the inputs must be equal. So $f$ assigns unique outputs to unique inputs
- Example
	- $f(x) = 2x$ for x $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$ is one-to-one, because each input x gives a unique output

- The term injective is more commonly used in formal mathematical writing or advanced contexts. The term one-to-one is often used in introductory mathematics or more informal discussions
- Different from a [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]]

## Source[^5]
- A function $f: S \to T$ is one-to-one if, whenever $s_1$ and $s_2$ are distinct elements of S, their images $f(s_1)$ and $f(s_2)$ are distinct elements of T. Equivalently, $f$ is one-to-one if $f(s_1) = $f(s_2)$ implies that $s_1 = s_2$. Synonymous with injective

## Source[^6]
- (one-to-one function) A function with the property that distinct elements in its domain are mapped onto distinct elements in the codomain. Formally,$$f: X \rightarrow Y$$is an injection if$$f\left(x_{1}\right)=f\left(x_{2}\right) \quad \text { implies } \quad x_{1}=x_{2}$$A common use of injections is to map or include elements of some smaller set, such as the set of integers, into a larger set, such as the set of real numbers.

- $n$. introduction into the body of drugs or other fluids by means of a syringe, usually drugs that would be destroyed by the digestive processes if taken by mouth. Common routes for injection are into the skin (intracutaneous or intradermal); below the skin (subcutaneous), e.g. for insulin; into a muscle (intramuscular), for drugs that are slowly absorbed; and into a vein (intravenous, IV), for drugs to be rapidly absorbed. Enemas are also regarded as injections.
