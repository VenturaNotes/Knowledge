## Synthesis
- The practice of connecting devices (computers, servers, smartphones) to share resources, communicate, and exchange data
### How it Works
- Devices (computers) use hardware ([[Network Interface Card|network interface cards]], routers) and software (protocols) to send and receive data
- Data is divided into packets, which are sent over physical or [[wireless media]].
- Networking protocols (such as [[TCP-IP suite|TCP/IP]]) ensure the data reaches its destination accurately
### Application layer
- The application layer makes networking seamless
	- Without it, user applications would need to directly handle complex networking tasks like managing protocols or routing data
	- Application layer abstracts these details, simplifying communication
