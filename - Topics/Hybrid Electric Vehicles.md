## Source [^1]
- Hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) are vehicles powered by an electric engine and a petrol or diesel combustion engine. Depending on the driving conditions, HEVs can switch from one engine to the other. An HEV uses energy stored in batteries, which the vehicle charges with its combustion engine and regenerative braking—a feature that turns a vehicle's kinetic energy into electricity to increase efficiency. These batteries also reduce the amount of time the vehicle's engines stay idle when the it is not moving.
