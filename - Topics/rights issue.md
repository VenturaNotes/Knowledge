- A method by which listed companies on a stock exchange raise new capital, in exchange for new shares. The name arises from the principle of pre-emption rights, according to which existing shareholders must be offered the new shares in proportion to their holding of old shares (a rights offer). For example in a 1 for 4 rights issue, shareholders would be asked to buy one new share for every four they already hold. As rights are usually issued at a discount to the market price of existing shares, those not wishing to take up their rights can sell them in the market. Compare BOUGHT DEAL; VENDOR PLACING; SCRIP ISSUE.
