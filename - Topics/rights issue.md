- A method by which listed companies on a stock exchange raise new capital, in exchange for new shares. The name arises from the principle of pre-emption rights, according to which existing shareholders must be offered the new shares in proportion to their holding of old shares (a rights offer). For example in a 1 for 4 rights issue, shareholders would be asked to buy one new share for every four they already hold. As rights are usually issued at a discount to the market price of existing shares, those not wishing to take up their rights can sell them in the market. Compare BOUGHT DEAL; VENDOR PLACING; SCRIP ISSUE.

- An issue of new shares in a company which are first offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their present holdings: shareholders are entitled but not obliged to take up their rights. Where the issue price is below the market price of the shares, it may be possible to sell the rights. If rights are not taken up, the shares are sold in the market, and shareholders receive the excess if the shares fetch more than the issue price. The advantage of a rights issue as a means of raising capital is that the register of present shareholders provides a ready-made list of people who have already shown some interest in a company.
