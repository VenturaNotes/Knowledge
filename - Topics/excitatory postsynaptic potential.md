- (EPSP) The electric potential that is generated in a postsynaptic neuron during the transmission of a nerve impulse (see SYNAPSE). It is caused by depolarization of the postsynaptic membrane when a neurotransmitter (such as acetylcholine), released from the presynaptic membrane, binds to the postsynaptic membrane. This will induce an action potential in the receiving neuron if the EPSP is large enough. See FACILITATION. Compare INHIBITORY POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIAL.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A graded depolarization or decrease in electrical potential across the membrane of a postsynaptic neuron, occurring in response to a signal transmitted across a synapse by a presynaptic neuron, increasing the propensity of the postsynaptic neuron to initiate a nerve impulse. Also called postsynaptic excitation. See also ACTION POTENTIAL, DEPOLARIZATION, POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIAL, RESTING POTENTIAL. Compare INHIBITORY POSTSYNAPTIC POTENTIAL. EPSP abbrev.
