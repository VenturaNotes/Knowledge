- The right to write down capital goods for tax purposes faster than the rate at which they would normally be depreciated. This is intended to encourage investment, as it enables a company to defer its taxes when it invests. Under accelerated depreciation a firmâ€™s profits net of depreciation, and thus its tax liabilities, are lower than they would have been under normal depreciation. Once the capital goods are written off, profits net of depreciation become higher than they would have been under normal depreciation, and the tax bill rises again.

- A rate of depreciation of assets that is faster than the useful-life basis normally used to calculate depreciation. For example, a computer may be expected to have a useful life of four years when it is purchased; however, as a result of new product innovation, it is replaced after two years. If the useful-life basis had been used, the full cost would not have been charged to the accounts until the end of the fourth year; by accelerating the depreciation the full charge would be made earlier, reflecting the short life cycle of high-technology products. In the USA, the accelerated depreciation may be used to gain tax advantages.
