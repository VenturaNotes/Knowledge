- (1) A form of marketing that takes into consideration the long-term welfare of society. For many years the individual needs of consumers dominated the practice of marketing. For example, two cars might be compared in terms of their acceleration. It is now recognized, however, that both cars may have jeopardized the long-term welfare of society as a result of the pollution they cause. Adapting both cars to run on lead-free petrol is an example of the way in which societal marketing concepts are being used. 
- (2) Marketing techniques applied to a social cause, such as an anti-pollution campaign or an anti-smoking campaign.
