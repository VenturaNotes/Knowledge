- $n$. A peptide consisting of nine amino acids, extracted from the venous blood of rabbits after putting them to sleep through electrical stimulation of the thalamus. When injected into other rabbits, it induces slow-wave sleep, and when injected into human subjects it has a similar effect. \[So called because it induces deep sleep with associated delta waves]
