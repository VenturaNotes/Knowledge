## Source [^1]
- The addition to the stock of capital goods in an economy during a particular period (the gross investment) less capital consumption (i.e. depreciation).
## Source[^2]
- The net increase in the amount of capital. This equals gross investment less an estimate of capital consumption. Net investment is harder to measure than gross, since while gross investment is mainly based on actual market transactions in acquiring capital goods, capital consumption is not based on observing market transactions, but is an estimate of the loss of value of the existing capital stock due to wear and tear, the passage of time, and abnormal obsolescence.
