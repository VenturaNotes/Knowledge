- Communications as a Service (CaaS) refers to internet-based communication services that include VoIP, internet telephony, video conferencing, and video messaging. Users of CaaS outsource these services from third-party providers who manage and maintain the required communications technology. For example, a provider might look after a VoIP server on behalf of users and charge them a monthly fee for the services.
