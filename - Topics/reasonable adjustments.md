- Under the Equality Act 2010 the employer or potential employer of a disabled person is under a duty to make 'reasonable adjustments'. Three requirements apply where a disabled person would otherwise be placed at a substantial disadvantage compared with people who are not disabled. The first involves making adjustments to any provision, criterion, or practice imposed by the employer that creates such a disadvantage (e.g. where rules on sickness absence have a disproportionate impact on a disabled employee). The second involves making changes to physical barriers in the workplace (e.g. providing a wheelchair ramp). The third involves providing an auxiliary aid or auxiliary service (e.g. special computer software). A failure to comply with any of these requirements is discrimination against a disabled person. The duty is subject to a test of reasonableness. This is judged objectively (rather than from the point of view of the employer) and will take account of such factors as practicality and cost.
