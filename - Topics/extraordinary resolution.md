- Formerly, a type of resolution submitted to a general meeting of a company; 14 days' notice of such a resolution was required and $75 \%$ of those voting had to approve the resolution for it to be passed. Under the Companies Act 1985 certain decisions (e.g. to wind up a company) could only be effected by extraordinary resolution; the Companies Act 2006 removed such a requirement, although it may still be present in the articles of a company.
