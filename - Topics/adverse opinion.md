- An opinion expressed in an auditors' report to the effect that the financial statements do not give a true and fair view of the organization's activities. This situation usually arises when there is a disagreement between the auditor and the directors, and the auditor considers the effect of the disagreement so material or pervasive that the financial statements are seriously misleading. See AUDIT OPINION; QUALIFIED AUDIT REPORT.
