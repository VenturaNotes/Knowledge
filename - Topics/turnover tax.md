- A tax on the sales made by a business, i.e. on its turnover. See SALES TAX.

- A tax proportional to a firm's turnover. This gives an incentive for vertical integration, as the tax may make it cheaper to produce an intermediate product within a firm than to buy a similar input produced more efficiently by an outside supplier. Value-added taxes have been very widely adopted in preference to turnover taxes because they do not provide this artificial inducement to vertical integration.
