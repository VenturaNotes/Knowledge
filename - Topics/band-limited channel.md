- A transmission channel with defined finite bandwidth. All physically realizable channels are band-limited by the constraints of the transmission medium and the drivers and receivers. The bandwidth may be deliberately constrained by filtering to limit the emission of or susceptibility to EMI. See also CHANNEL CODING THEOREM, DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS.
