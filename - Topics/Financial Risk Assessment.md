- A financial risk assessment is a general term used across industries to reference an evaluation of the probability that a financial asset, loan, or investment could lose value. Financial risk assessment determines how worthwhile a specific investment might be and the best means of mitigating related risk. Risk assessment can help determine the rate of return an investor would need to earn to consider an investment worth its potential risk.
