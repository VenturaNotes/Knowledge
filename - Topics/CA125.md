- n. a tumor marker that can be detected by a simple blood test and is particularly useful in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer and also for subsequently monitoring its response to treatment. In a patient being evaluated for a pelvic mass, a CA125 level greater than 65 is associated with malignancy in approximately $90 \%$ of cases (see RISK OF MALIGNANCY INDEX). A number of benign conditions, including endometriosis and heart failure, can also cause elevations of the CA125 level, as can cancers other than ovarian cancer, including malignancies of the endometrium, lung, breast, and gastrointestinal tract.
