## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- The construction of a version of an operating system. Any large system is almost invariably constructed from a number of separate modules of code, each dealing with specific aspects of the system or with specific types of device. Where it is known that a facility or device will not be supported, it is possible to omit the corresponding modules and to generate a version of the system that contains only modules that are known to be required. This is achieved during system generation.
