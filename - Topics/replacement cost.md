- The cost of replacing an asset, either in its present physical form or as the cost of obtaining equivalent services. If the latter is lower in amount than the former, the conclusion is that the assets currently used by the company are not those it would choose to acquire in the market place. Replacement cost may be used to value tangible fixed assets and in some circumstances such current assets as stock.

- The system of accounting in which the assets of firms are valued and their depreciation allowances are calculated using the costs of replacing their buildings and equipment. Where buildings and equipment can be replaced exactly, this might seem an ideal accounting method. However, particularly in the case of equipment, owing to technical progress, exact replacements are frequently not available, and would not be worth installing even if they were. In such cases calculating the cost of appropriate replacements for equipment is very much a matter of judgement.
