- A set of formal rules that projects a finite set of sentences upon the potentially infinite set of sentences that constitute the language as a whole; the term was originally introduced by Noam Chomsky (1957). Among models of generative grammar that have been investigated are finite-state, phrase-structure, and transformational grammars.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A term introduced by the US linguist and philosopher (Avram) Noam Chomsky (born 1928) in his book Syntactic Structures (1957) to refer to a description of a language in terms of a finite set of explicitly specified rules capable of generating the potentially infinite set of all grammatical sentences in the language, and only those sentences. See also CASE GRAMMAR, CONTEXT-DEPENDENT GRAMMAR, CONTEXT-FREE GRAMMAR, KERNEL, COMPETENCE (2), PERFORMANCE (2), PHRASE-STRUCTURE GRAMMAR, REWRITE RULE. Compare FINITE-STATE GRAMMAR, TRANSFORMATIONAL GRAMMAR.
