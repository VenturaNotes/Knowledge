- A set of formal rules that projects a finite set of sentences upon the potentially infinite set of sentences that constitute the language as a whole; the term was originally introduced by Noam Chomsky (1957). Among models of generative grammar that have been investigated are finite-state, phrase-structure, and transformational grammars.
