- (PVL) softening of white matter around the ventricles of the brain in preterm infants due to a decreased blood supply to the brain, usually associated with hypoxic-ischaemic encephalopathy. Diagnosis is by ultrasound, which shows increased density and, later, cysts in the periventricular area. The brain damage can cause visual impairment and cerebral palsy.
