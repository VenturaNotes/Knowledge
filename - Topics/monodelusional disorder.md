- a condition marked by a persistent delusion not associated with any other mental illness. It is often of a paranoid or persecutory nature, but can have any delusional content. Treatment is often difficult because patients commonly lack insight and refuse to try medication. When compliance can be achieved, the majority of patients respond well to antipsychotic medication.
