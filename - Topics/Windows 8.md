- (Trademark) The current version of Microsoft Windows, released in 2012 to replace Windows 7. It marked a major move towards supporting tablet devices with touch-based user interfaces as well as including further performance and security upgrades. The desktop interface familiar from previous versions of Windows was retained, but was no longer the default starting-point once a user had logged in; instead, a new 'start' page showing large rectangular application and content icons is presented.
