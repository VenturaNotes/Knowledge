- adj. describing impulses traveling 'the wrong way' in a nerve fiber. This is rare but may happen in shingles, when the irritation caused by the virus in the spinal canal initiates impulses that travel outwards in normally afferent nerves. The area of skin that the sensory nerves supply (usually a strip on the trunk) becomes painfully blistered. Antidromic impulses cannot pass synapses, which work in one direction only.
## Source[^2]
- adj. Of or relating to a nerve impulse conducted in the opposite direction to normal, towards the cell body rather than away from it, as when the axon of a sensory neuron responds to injury of the skin by sending impulses backwards to branching points, triggering the release of substance P. See axon reflex. Compare orthodromic. \[From Greek anti against + dromos a course or run + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
