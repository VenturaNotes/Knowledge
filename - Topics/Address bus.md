- address bus A bus that is dedicated to passing address information. It may be a set of conductors that are physically separate from other dedicated buses or it may be a subset of a system bus. The number of conductors is often the same as the maximum allowable number of bits in the address (with the possible addition of some extra conductors carrying control signals).
