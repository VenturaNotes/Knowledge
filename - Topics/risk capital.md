- (venture capital) Capital invested in a project in which there is a substantial element of risk, especially money invested in a new venture or an expanding business. It is also used in buyouts by private equity firms and employee or management buy-outs (see BIMBO). Risk capital is normally invested in the equity of the company in the hope of a high return; it is not a loan (but see SHAREHOLDER DEBT).
