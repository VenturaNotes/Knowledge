- (venture capital) Capital invested in a project in which there is a substantial element of risk, especially money invested in a new venture or an expanding business. It is also used in buyouts by private equity firms and employee or management buy-outs (see BIMBO). Risk capital is normally invested in the equity of the company in the hope of a high return; it is not a loan (but see SHAREHOLDER DEBT).
## Source[^2]
- Capital which the owners are willing to invest in equity in new and untried projects, where there is a recognized chance that they will lose it. Venture capitalists are willing to take these risks if they expect that their successes will make sufficiently large profits to keep their average return positive, in spite of some losses. Venture capital may be provided by individuals who are almost or entirely risk-neutral, or by investment banks and other organizations which are large enough to be able to spread their investments sufficiently to reduce risk to acceptable levels by risk pooling.
