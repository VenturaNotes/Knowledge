- (of computers) A designation covering machines that were designed after 1970 (approximately).
- Conceptually the most important criterion that can be used to separate them from the third generation is that they were designed to work efficiently with the current generation of high-level languages$\textemdash$fourth-generation languages$\textemdash$and were intended to be easier to program by their end-user. From a hardware point of view they are characterized by being constructed largely from integrated circuits and have multi-megabyte fast RAM fabricated in MOS technology. These volatile memories are intimately connected to high-speed disk units so that on power failure or switch-off, data in MOS memory is retained by automatic transfer to the disks. On switch-on, commonly the system is started up from a bootstrap ROM, which loads the operating system and resident software back into the MOS memory as required.
