- The retention of the juvenile body form, or particular features of it, in a mature animal. For example, the axolotl, a salamander, retains the gills of the larva in the adult. Neoteny is thought to have been an important mechanism in the evolution of certain groups, such as humans, who are believed to have developed from the juvenile forms of apes. Most strikingly, adult humans retain a skull shape that closely resembles that of an infant, giving a large brain case, whereas in the closely related chimpanzees, the skull undergoes a dramatic change of shape into adulthood, with a much smaller brain case. See also HETEROCHRONY.

Persistence in the adult form of attributes of the foetal form, or attributes that were confined to the foetal form in ancestors, such as the tadpole form of the mature adults of some amphibian species, or the lack of body hair in humans. neotenous adj. \[From Greek neos new + teinein to stretch]
