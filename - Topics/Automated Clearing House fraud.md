- Automated clearing house fraud (ACH fraud) is the act of fraudulently obtaining funds through the ACH financial transaction network. The ACH is an electronic funds-transferring system that was established in the mid-1970s. ACH transfers account for payments made, deposits received, and other bank account transfers. ACH fraud occurs when scammers pose as a bank, employer, or billing company in order to gain the account information (account or routing number) of a bank user's financial account. Once the fraudster receives this information, they may take hold of a bank userâ€™s account and set up automatic payments to themselves.
