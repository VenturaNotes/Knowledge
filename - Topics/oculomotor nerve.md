- the third cranial nerve (III), which is composed of motor fibers distributed to muscles in and around the eye. Fibers of the parasympathetic system are responsible for altering the size of the pupil and the lens of the eye. Fibers outside the eye run to the upper eyelid and to muscles that turn the eyeball in different directions.

- $n$. Either of the third pair of cranial nerves, arising from the superior colliculus and supplying some of the extra-ocular muscles, the ciliary muscles that increase the convexity of the lens for near vision, and the sphincter muscle of the pupil. Paralysis of this nerve causes pupil dilation and divergent squint. See also Argyll Robertson pupil, ptosis. \[From Latin oculus the eye + motor a mover, from movere to move]
