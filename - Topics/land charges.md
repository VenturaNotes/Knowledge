- Encumbrances, such as contracts, payments, or other matters, to which land is subject; if they are not dealt with before the land is sold, they will usually bind the purchaser. Formerly, they bound a purchaser who had notice of them. Now most of them must be registered if they are to remain effective, either under the Land Charges Act 1972 (applicable to unregistered land) or under the Land Registration Act 1925 (applicable to registered land).
