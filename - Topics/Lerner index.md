- A measure of monopoly power. The Lerner index is defined by $L=(p-c) / p$, where $p$ is price of the firm's output and $c$ is the marginal cost of production. If the firm operates in a competitive market then $p=c$ and $L=0$. Conversely, if the firm is a monopolist then $L=1 /\left|\varepsilon_{d}\right|$ where $\left|\varepsilon_{d}\right|$ is the absolute value of the elasticity of demand.
