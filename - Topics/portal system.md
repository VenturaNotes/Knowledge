- a vein or group of veins that terminates at both ends in a capillary bed. The best known is the hepatic portal system, which consists of the portal vein and its tributaries (see illustration). Blood is drained from the spleen, stomach, pancreas, and small and large intestines into veins that merge to form the portal vein leading to the liver. Here the portal vein branches, ending in many small capillaries called sinusoids. These permit the passage into the liver cells of nutrients absorbed by blood from the intestines.
