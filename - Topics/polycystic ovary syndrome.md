- (PCOS, Stein-Leventhal syndrome) a heterogeneous disorder characterized by hyperandrogenism (clinical hirsutism, biochemical hyperandrogenism, or both) and ovarian dysfunction (with polycystic ovaries), which results in amenorrhoea or oligomenorrhoea (absent or infrequent menstrual periods) and is associated with subfertility (from lack of ovulatory menstrual cycles). The condition is associated with obesity and insulin resistance, which increase the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus, endometrial cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Treatment is based on dietary and exercise advice, metformin, hormones to regulate the menstrual cycle, and in cases of subfertility, clomifene to induce ovulation; the hyperandrogenism usually responds to antiandrogens.
