- (CABG) coronary revascularization in which a segment of a coronary artery narrowed by atheroma is bypassed by an autologous section of healthy saphenous vein or internal mammary artery at thoracotomy. The improved blood flow resulting from one or more such grafts relieves angina pectoris and reduces the risk of myocardial infarction. Recently developed techniques of minimally invasive surgery have enabled the operation to be performed without the need for thoracotomy.
