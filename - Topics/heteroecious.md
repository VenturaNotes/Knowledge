- Describing a parasite that passes different phases of its life cycle in different host species. For example, adult tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus live in the small intestine of dogs and other canids, whereas the eggs develop into hydatid cysts in the lungs or liver of intermediate hosts such as cattle, horses, or humans. Rust fungi are also examples of heteroecious species (see RUSTS). Compare AUTOECIOUS.
