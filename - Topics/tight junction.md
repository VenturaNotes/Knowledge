- (zonula occludens) The region between the plasma membranes of two adjacent cells that are so closely positioned that there is no intercellular space between them. This type of junction fuses cells together and provides a selective barrier to the diffusion of substances between cells. Tight junctions are common between cells of the intestinal epithelium, where they act to seal off the intestinal lumen from the intercellular fluid. See also CELL JUNCTION.
