- Practical economic knowledge, enabling firms to achieve results. Some of this is technical in nature, and can in principle be made into private property by the use of patents, although these may be difficult to enforce. Much practical know-how, however, takes forms such as modes of organization, professional standards, or systems of incentives, which cannot be privatized by patents.
