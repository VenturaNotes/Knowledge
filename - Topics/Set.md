## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $A \backslash U$
	- The set of all elements in A not in U
## Source[^2]
- A set is a well-defined collection of objects
	- Allows us to determine for any given object `x` whether or not `x` belongs to the set
- Objects that belong to a set are called elements/members
- Sets typically denoted by capital letters such as `A` or `X`
- If `a` is an element of set A, we write 
	- $a \in A$ 
- Every set is a [[subset]] of itself
## Source[^3]
- A set is composed of elements or members where each element is a possible outcome
- A set is denoted by capital letters

## Source[^4]
- Sets and [[maps]] are considered basic building blocks of mathematical world

	- A set is a collection of distinct objects into a whole
		- Not necessarily a correct definition, but idea we have in mind
	- Such an object `x` inside a set M is called an [[element (Math)|element]] of M, written as: $x \in M$ 
	- If `x` is not such an object inside the set M, we write $x \notin M$ 
		- Which equivalently means: $\lnot (x \in M)$ 
- A set can be [[defined by]] giving all its elements
	- $A := \{2, 5, 6\}$
		- No order
		- Lefthand side is defined by the righthand side
### Examples of Sets
- [[Empty set]]
	- Has no elements
	- $\varnothing$ := {}
- [[Natural Numbers]]
	- $\mathbb{N}$ := {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}
	- Explicitly including zero: $\mathbb{N}_0 := \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$
- [[Integers]]
	- $\mathbb{Z}:= \{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}$
- [[Rational Numbers]]
	- $\mathbb{Q}$
- [[Real Numbers]]
	- $\mathbb{R}$
- [[Complex Numbers]]
	- $\mathbb{C}$
