## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $A \backslash U$
	- The set of all elements in A not in U
## Source[^2]
- A set is a well-defined collection of objects
	- Allows us to determine for any given object `x` whether or not `x` belongs to the set
- Objects that belong to a set are called elements/members
- Sets typically denoted by capital letters such as `A` or `X`
- If `a` is an element of set A, we write 
	- $a \in A$ 
- Every set is a [[subset]] of itself
## Source[^3]
- A set is composed of elements or members where each element is a possible outcome
- A set is denoted by capital letters

## Source[^4]
- Sets and [[maps]] are considered basic building blocks of mathematical world

	- A set is a collection of distinct objects into a whole
		- Not necessarily a correct definition, but idea we have in mind
	- Such an object `x` inside a set M is called an [[members|element]] of M, written as: $x \in M$ 
	- If `x` is not such an object inside the set M, we write $x \notin M$ 
		- Which equivalently means: $\lnot (x \in M)$ 
- A set can be [[defined by]] giving all its elements
	- $A := \{2, 5, 6\}$
		- No order
		- Lefthand side is defined by the righthand side
### Examples of Sets
- [[Empty set]]
	- Has no elements
	- $\varnothing$ := {}
- [[Natural Numbers]]
	- $\mathbb{N}$ := {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}
	- Explicitly including zero: $\mathbb{N}_0 := \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$
- [[Integers]]
	- $\mathbb{Z}:= \{..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...\}$
- [[Rational Numbers]]
	- $\mathbb{Q}$
- [[Real Numbers]]
	- $\mathbb{R}$
- [[Complex Numbers]]
	- $\mathbb{C}$

### Counting with Sets
- Can solve a problem using sets
- Given a restaurant offers 8 appetizers and 14 entrées, how many choices do you have if you will eat one dish, either an appetizer or an entrée.
	- This problem uses the [[additive principle]] so we can create two disjoint sets with [[Cardinality|cardinalities]] $|A| = 8$ and $|B| = 14$ where A contains 8 appetizers and B contains 14 entrees. 
	- This problem is the same thing as asking the [[union]] of both sets giving $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| = 8 + 14 = 22$
