## Source [^1]
- $A \backslash U$
	- The set of all elements in A not in U
## Source[^2]
- A set is a well-defined collection of objects
	- Allows us to determine for any given object `x` whether or not `x` belongs to the set
- Objects that belong to a set are called elements/members
- Sets typically denoted by capital letters such as `A` or `X`
- If `a` is an element of set A, we write 
	- $a \in A$ 
- Every set is a [[subset]] of itself

## Source[^3]
- A set is composed of elements or members where each element is a possible outcome
- A set is denoted by capital letters
