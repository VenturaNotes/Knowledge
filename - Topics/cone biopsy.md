- surgical removal, by knife or laser, of a cone-shaped segment of tissue from the cervix of the uterus. It may be performed if a cervical biopsy (see COLPOSCOPY) reveals evidence of cervical carcinoma in situ (cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type 3): the abnormal tissue is removed and examined microscopically for confirmation of complete removal of the abnormality.
