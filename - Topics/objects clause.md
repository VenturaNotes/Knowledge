- Formerly, a clause contained in the memorandum of association of a company setting out the objects for which the company was formed. If the company undertook any activities not included in the objects clause, it would have been acting beyond its powers, i.e. ultra vires. The Companies Act 2006 removed the requirement for a company to state its objects in such a clause and effectively abolished the concept of ultra vires.
