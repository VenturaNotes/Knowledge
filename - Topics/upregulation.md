- An increase in the sensitivity of a cell to a chemical substance, such as a hormone, signal molecule, or drug, due to an increase in the density of cell-surface receptors for that molecule. Upregulation of a gene entails an increased rate of transcription and enhanced expression of its effect on the cell or tissue, e.g. through an increased concentration of RNA or protein. The converse, downregulation, reduces the cell's sensitivity or gene expression.
