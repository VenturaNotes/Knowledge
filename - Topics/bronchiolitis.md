- $n$. inflammation of the small airways in the lungs (the bronchioles) due to viral infection, usually the respiratory syncytial virus. Bronchiolitis occurs in epidemics and is commonest in infants of less than one year. The bronchioles become swollen, the lining cells die, and the tubes become blocked with debris and mucopus. This prevents air reaching the alveoli and the child becomes short of oxygen (hypoxic) and breathless. In mild cases no treatment is necessary; more severe cases require supportive treatment $\textendash$ administration of oxygen and feeding via a nasogastric tube. Antibiotics are indicated only if there is evidence of a secondary infection. If the child is particularly vulnerable, specific treatment with ribavirin or artificial ventilation may be beneficial. Recurrent attacks of bronchiolitis may herald the onset of asthma.
