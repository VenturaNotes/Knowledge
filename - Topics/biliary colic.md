- severe abdominal pain resulting from obstruction of the cystic duct or common bile duct by (most commonly) a gallstone. The pain is felt in the right upper quadrant of the abdomen but may be poorly localized due to its visceral nature. It often occurs about an hour after a meal (particularly if fatty), may last several hours, and is usually constant in severity (unlike other forms of colic). Vomiting often occurs.
