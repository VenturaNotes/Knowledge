- (Symbol A). The energy change occurring when an atom or molecule gains an electron to form a negative ion. For an atom or molecule X, it is the energy released for the electron-attachment reaction $$X(g) + e \to X^{-}(g)$$Often that is measured in electronvolts. Alternatively, the molar enthalpy change, $\Delta H$, can be used
