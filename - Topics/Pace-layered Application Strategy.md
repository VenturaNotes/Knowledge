- Pace-layered application strategy is a method for categorizing, selecting, managing, and governing applications. This Gartner-designed strategy focuses on business change, differentiation, and innovationâ€”the three categories that make up a pace-layered application strategy. Systems of innovation focus on new applications. Systems of differentiation consider better applications. Systems of change rely on common applications, which tend to be the standard. The strategy aims to increase response time and return on investment (ROI) without negative impact.
