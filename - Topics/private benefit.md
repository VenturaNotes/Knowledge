- The benefit arising to a single individual from an economic activity. The maximization of private benefit is the guiding principle of economic decision-making. When all economic agents follow this principle then market equilibrium will be Pareto efficient if there is no market failure. If an externality is present, private benefit is not equal to social benefit and inefficiency can result.
