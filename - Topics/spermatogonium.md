- $n$. (pl. spermatogonia) a cell produced at an early stage in the formation of spermatozoa (see SPERMATOGENESIS). Spermatogonia first appear in the testis of the fetus but do not multiply significantly until after puberty. They act as stem cells in the walls of the seminiferous tubules, dividing continuously by mitosis and giving rise to spermatocytes.
