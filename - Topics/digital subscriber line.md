- A family of digital systems designed to allow high speed data communication over the existing copper wires. The first technology based on DSL was ISDN, although ISDN is not often recognized as such nowadays. Since then a large number of other protocols have been developed, collectively referred to as xDSL, including HDSL, SDSL, ADSL, and VDSL.
## Source[^3]
- A digital subscriber line (DSL) is an internet connection that uses telephone lines to transfer high-speed data to users. This technology delivers digital signals over a phone line connected to a modem and helps prevent service interruption and other problems associated with older internet technologies. A DSL, for instance, allows users to browse the internet while making phone calls.
