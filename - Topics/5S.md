- The 5S methodology refers to the five Japanese "S"-words—Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu, and Shitsuke—that represent principles of lean and efficient work habits. These loosely translate into English as sort, straighten, sanitize, standardize, and sustain. Each of these steps should happen sequentially and on an iterative basis. Following this methodology should result in a workplace that is clean, uncluttered, safe, and well-organized to help reduce waste and optimize productivity for the workers, processes, and the overall business.
