- (MCI) cognitive impairment beyond that expected for age and education that does not interfere with normal daily function. When memory loss is the predominant symptom it is termed amnestic MCI and is frequently seen as an early stage of Alzheimer's disease. However, other aspects of cognition can be affected and symptoms can be stable or even remit.

- $n$. A condition characterized by slight amnesia without dementia or other forms of cognitive impairment, often a precursor of Alzheimer's disease. It may be diagnosed in a patient who complains of memory loss, and has demonstrable memory impairment compared to other people of similar age, but is capable of carrying out normal activities of daily life, has normal general cognitive functioning, and does not meet the criteria for the diagnosis of dementia. Approximately 80 per cent of people with the condition develop Alzheimer's disease within 10 years. Also called cognitive impairment no dementia (CIND). See also Clock Drawing Test, Mini-Mental State Examination. MCI abbrev.
