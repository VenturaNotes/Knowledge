- (MCI) cognitive impairment beyond that expected for age and education that does not interfere with normal daily function. When memory loss is the predominant symptom it is termed amnestic MCI and is frequently seen as an early stage of Alzheimer's disease. However, other aspects of cognition can be affected and symptoms can be stable or even remit.
