## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The study of the proteins synthesized by a particular cell or organism (see PROTEOME). This vast and rapidly expanding field is of fundamental significance to many areas of biology and medicine. It endeavors to determine what proteins a cell makes, how and when it makes them and in what quantities, how different proteins function, where they function, and how they interact with other cell components, including other proteins. Moreover, proteomics seeks to discover the internal and external factors that influence the proteome, for example during development, disease, aging, or evolution. See protein PROFILING. See also TRANSCRIPTOMICS.
