- (pl. acini) The smallest unit of a multilobular gland, such as the pancreas. Each acinus in the pancreas is made up of a hollow cluster of acinar cells, which produce the digestive enzymes secreted in pancreatic juice. Minute ducts from the pancreatic acini eventually drain into the pancreatic duct.
