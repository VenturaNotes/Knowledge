- A management approach in which business objectives are clearly defined in advance and a detailed plan for attaining them is set out and adhered to. The chief advantage of such a strategy is that targets can be identified and progress measured. The disadvantage is the risk of inflexibility. A prescriptive strategy can be contrasted with an emergent strategy, which is more responsive to unexpected events or changed circumstances. See also DELIBERATE STRATEGY.
