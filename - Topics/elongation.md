## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (1) (in protein synthesis) The phase in which amino acids are linked together by sequentially formed peptide bonds to form a polypeptide chain (see translation). Elongation factors are proteins that$\textemdash$by binding to a tRNA-amino-acid complex$\textemdash$enable the correct positioning of this complex on the ribosome, so that translation can proceed. The key peptidyltransferase reaction required for formation of the peptide bond is catalyzed not by a protein but by the large RNA subunit of the ribosome.
