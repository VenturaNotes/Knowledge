	- $\lnot A \lor A$ is a tautology because it's always true as shown in the truth table
	- Useful because you can always substitute a tautology with "True"
		- #question I would like to see an example of where this is useful
- #question is a tautology a [[Logical operations|logical operation]]?

- Sirce $A \land B \implies B$
	- This is considered to be a tautology as this will always return True. 
	- #question Does this mean $A \land B \implies A$ would be valid as well? Would it make a difference? 

## Source[^3]
- A law of logic, in the form of a proposition, that describes a universal truth; no matter what values are assigned to the variables in the proposition the result is always true. An example from the propositional calculus is $$(P \lor Q)'=P' \land Q'$$where $\land$ and $\lor$ are the `or` and `and` operators and $P'$ is the negation of $P$. In the truth table for a tautology, the final result column contains only the value true. If the final column contains only the value false, then a [[contradiction]] has been identified
