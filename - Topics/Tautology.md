	- $\lnot A \lor A$ is a tautology because it's always true as shown in the truth table
	- Useful because you can always substitute a tautology with "True"
		- #question I would like to see an example of where this is useful
- #question is a tautology a [[Logical operations|logical operation]]?

- Sirce $A \land B \implies B$
	- This is considered to be a tautology as this will always return True. 
	- #question Does this mean $A \land B \implies A$ would be valid as well? Would it make a difference?
