- $n$. any deviation from the normal rhythm (sinus rhythm) of the heart. Arrhythmias result from a disturbance of the generation or the conduction of electrical impulses from the sinoatrial node and may be intermittent or continuous. They are subdivided into tachyarrhythmias (fast rate) and bradyarrhythmias (slow rate). They include ectopic beats (extrasystoles), re-entry tachycardia, ectopic tachycardias (see SUPRAVENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA; VENTRICULAR TACHYCARDIA), atrial and ventricular fibrillation, and heart block (which is often associated with slow heart rates). Symptoms include palpitations, breathlessness, and chest pain. In more serious arrhythmias the Stokes-Adams syndrome or cardiac arrest may occur. Arrhythmias may result from most heart diseases but they also occur without apparent cause.
