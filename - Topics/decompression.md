- (1) the reduction of pressure on an organ or part of the body by surgical intervention. Surgical decompression can be effected at many sites: the pressure of tissues on a nerve may be relieved by incision; raised pressure in the fluid of the brain can be lowered by cutting into the dura mater; and cardiac compression - the abnormal presence of blood or fluid round the heart $\textendash$ can be cured by cutting the sac (pericardium) enclosing the heart.
