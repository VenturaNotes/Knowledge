- $n$. an odorless colorless gas that makes up one-fifth of the atmosphere. Oxygen is essential to most forms of life in that it combines chemically with glucose (or some other fuel) to provide energy for metabolic processes. It is absorbed into the blood from air breathed into the lungs. Oxygen is administered therapeutically in various conditions in which the tissues are unable to obtain an adequate supply through the lungs (see OXYGENATOR; TENT). Symbol: O.
## Source[^2]
- Symbol O. A colorless odorless gaseous element. It is the most abundant element in the earth's crust ($49.2 \%$ by weight) and is present in the atmosphere ($28 \%$ by volume), mainly as dioxygen $\left(\mathrm{O}_{2}\right)$, with much smaller amounts of ozone $\left(\mathrm{O}_{3}\right)$. Atmospheric dioxygen is of vital importance for all organisms that carry out aerobic respiration.
