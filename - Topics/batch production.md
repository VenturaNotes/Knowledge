## Source [^1]
- A method of production where output emerges in discrete quantities. It is often used when there is a requirement that a certain quantity of a product should be of a uniform pattern and quality, but the required characteristics differ between different orders.
## Source[^2]
- A manufacturing process in which medium to high volumes of similar items are made in batches, rather than continuously, with the product moving from process to process in batches. The key to batch production is the careful scheduling of work to ensure good utilization of capacity and to minimize the capital locked up in work in progress. Examples in which batch production are used include small engineering works and book printers. See also BATCH COSTING. Compare CONTINUOUS PROCESSING.
