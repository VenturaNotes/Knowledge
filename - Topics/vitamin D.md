- a fat-soluble vitamin that enhances the absorption of calcium and phosphorus from the intestine and promotes their deposition in the bone. It occurs in two forms: ergocalciferol (vitamin $\mathbf{D}_{2}$, calciferol), which is manufactured by plants when the sterol ergosterol is exposed to ultraviolet light, and cholecalciferol (vitamin $\mathbf{D}_{3}$ ), which is produced by the action of sunlight on 7-dehydrocholesterol, a sterol widely distributed in the skin. A deficiency of vitamin D, either from a poor diet or lack of sunlight, leads to decalcified bones and the development of rickets and osteomalacia. Good sources of vitamin D are liver and fish oils. An RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) was set for the first time in 2015, at 10 $\mathrm{ug} / \mathrm{d}$ for all individuals over 4 years of age. Research continues into a possible association between vitamin D levels and multiple sclerosis. Vitamin D is toxic and large doses must therefore be avoided.
