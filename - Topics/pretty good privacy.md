- A utility that allows an email user to encrypt an outgoing mail message using a version of a public key encryption system (see CRYPTOGRAPHY). Although a PGP encrypted message might be decoded by a user with access to very powerful computing resources, the system offers a more than adequate level of protection for the normal user.
