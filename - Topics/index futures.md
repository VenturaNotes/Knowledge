- A financial futures contract on a financial index. On the FTSE 100 Index (see FTSE InDEXES) the trading unit is $£ 10$ per index point; thus if a futures contract is purchased when the index stands at 2,400, say, the buyer is covering an equivalent purchase of equities of $£ 24,000$. If the index rises 100 points the purchaser can sell a matching futures contract at this level, making a profit of $£ 1,000$. See also PORTFOLIO INSURANCE.
