- A daemon is a computer program that lies dormant within a larger application until a certain condition occurs that initiates it to do its processing. An operating system alerts the daemon of an upcoming request and the daemon either responds to the request or forwards the request to another program to handle. In the client-server model, daemons play the role of the server. Daemons are often used to log system messages, detach storage devices, manage HTTP requests, manage FTP service, and schedule time-based actions such as software updates or system checks.
