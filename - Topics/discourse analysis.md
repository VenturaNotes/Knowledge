- $n$. A method of qualitative research and a field of study devoted to understanding all forms of spoken interaction and written texts. It views language critically as an activity that constructs reality rather than merely describing or referring to it, and its theoretical approach is influenced by deconstruction, semiology, and speech act theory and tends to be critical of traditional theories and research methodologies in psychology. Research focuses on well-formed rules governing the sequence of permissible linguistic units and on such aspects of language as discourse markers$\textemdash$verbal expressions such as anyway, oh well, or I mean that demarcate units of speech.
