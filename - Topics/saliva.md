- $n$. the alkaline liquid secreted by the salivary glands and the mucous membrane of the mouth. Its principal constituents are water, mucus, buffers, and enzymes (e.g. amylase). The functions of saliva are to keep the mouth moist, to aid swallowing of food, to minimize changes of acidity in the mouth, and to digest starch. See also DRY MOUTH. $\textemdash$salivary adj.
## Source[^2]
- A watery fluid secreted by the salivary glands in the mouth. Production of saliva is stimulated by the presence of food in the mouth and also by the smell or thought of food. Saliva contains mucin, which lubricates food and eases its passage into the oesophagus, and in some animals salivary amylase (or ptyalin), which begins the digestion of starch. Lysozyme, an antimicrobial enzyme, also occurs in saliva, helping to protect the teeth and oral cavity against the bacteria in food. The saliva of insects is rich in digestive enzymes, and that of bloodsucking animals contains an anticoagulant.
