### (of a curve)
The part of a curve between two given points on the curve. If $A$ and $B$ are two points on a circle, there are two arcs $A B$. When $A$ and $B$ are not at opposite ends of a diameter, it is possible to distinguish between the longer and shorter arcs by referring to the major arc $A B$ and the minor arc $A B$.
