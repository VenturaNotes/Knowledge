- Hours worked in excess of an agreed number per week or per day. The payment made for overtime work is usually higher than the basic rate of pay. Unions therefore have an interest in making the basic working week as short as possible, so that those working longer hours earn as much as possible. Employers, on the other hand, want to make the working week as long as possible.
