- A mobile network operator (MNO) is an organization that provides a wireless communication service to subscribers by constructing, owning, and managing their own telecommunications infrastructure. It is typically used by businesses that need to communicate with customers on the go or in remote locations where landlines may not be available (e.g., mining sites).
