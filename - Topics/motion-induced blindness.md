- $n$. A tendency for a stationary or slowly moving stimulus to disappear from sight when viewed against a pattern of moving elements. In a standard demonstration of this phenomenon, three stationary or slowly moving yellow dots are viewed against a background of rotating blue dots or other shapes, and the yellow dots tend to disappear, singly or together, for several seconds at a stretch. The phenomenon is a form of simultanagnosia and may be related to change blindness, inattentional blindness, the Cheshire Cat effect, and the Troxler effect. It was discovered by the Israeli neuroscientist Yoram Bonneh (born 1959) and first published in an article in the journal Nature in 2001 by Bonneh and two colleagues, who pointed out that it could have serious consequences if, for example, moving traffic in a driver's field of vision induces temporary blindness to the tail-lights of a car in front.
