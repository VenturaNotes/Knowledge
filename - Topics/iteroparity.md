- The strategy of reproducing several or many times during a lifetime. Iteroparous organisms include perennial plants and the majority of animals. Organisms that have a specific breeding season and whose breeding population contains individuals of different ages, for example temperate-region trees, are said to show overlapping iteroparity. Organisms that breed repeatedly and do so at any time of year, such as humans, exhibit continuous iteroparity. Compare SEMELPARITY.
