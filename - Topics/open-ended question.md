- A question that requires respondents to provide answers in their own words, rather than 'yes', 'no', or 'don't know'. Such questions as Why...? What...? When...? are asked without providing answers from which to choose. Open-ended questions are often used in exploratory research. Compare MULTIPLE-CHOICE QUESTION; STRUCTURED INTERVIEW.

- $n$. A question framed in such a way as to encourage a full expression of an opinion rather than merely a yes/no answer or otherwise constrained response. An open-ended question allows the respondent to answer freely, without having to select an answer from a predetermined set or response categories. Such questions are commonplace in qualitative research, although responses to them present formidable problems of data analysis. In interviews or informal conversations, open-ended questions such as What do you feel about $X$? are more effective than closed questions in initiating interactions or encouraging discussion. Also called an open question.
