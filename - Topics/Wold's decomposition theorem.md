- A result stating that every zero-mean covariance stationary stochastic process $Y_t$  can be decomposed into a deterministic part and a non-deterministic part; the deterministic part is the optimal linear predictor of $Y_t$  based on its lagged values and is uncorrelated with the non-deterministic part, which, in its turn, can be represented as an infinite-order moving-average process.
