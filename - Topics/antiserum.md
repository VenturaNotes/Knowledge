- n. (pl. antisera) a serum that contains antibodies against antigens of a particular kind; it may be injected to treat, or give temporary protection (passive immunity) against, specific diseases. Antisera are prepared in large quantities in such animals as horses. In the laboratory, they are used to identify unknown organisms responsible for infection (see AGGLUTINATION).
## Source[^2]
- Serum containing antibodies, either raised against particular antigens, and hence of known specificity, or a broad mixture of antibodies. It is used to provide short-term passive immunity, e.g. against hepatitis A virus, and to treat an infection to which the patient has no immunity. Antisera may be obtained from large animals, such as horses, that have been inoculated with particular antigens, or from pooled donated human serum.
