- Partner relationship management (PRM) is the process of managing and developing relationships with business partners. PRM helps companies identify potential new partners, assess the value of partnerships, and manage partner interactions. Having a good PRM system in place helps increase sales and boost revenue. PRM primarily includes an organization's indirect sales channels such as resellers, distributors, and dealers.
