- (P/E ratio) The current market price of a company share divided by the earnings per share (eps) of the company. The $\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{E}$ ratio usually refers to the annual eps and is expressed as a number (e.g. 5 or 10), often called the multiple of the company. Loosely, it can be thought of as the number of years it would take the company to earn an amount equal to its market value. High multiples, usually associated with low yields, indicate that the company is growing rapidly, while a low multiple is associated with dull no-growth stocks. The $\mathrm{P} / \mathrm{E}$ ratio is one of the main indicators used by fundamental analysts to decide whether the shares in a company are expensive or cheap, relative to the market.

- (P/E ratio) The ratio of the current market price of a company's ordinary shares to its most recently published earnings for equity per share. A relatively high price-earnings ratio may mean that earnings are expected to grow rapidly, or that they are regarded as relatively safe. A low price-earnings ratio indicates either that earnings are expected to grow slowly or fall, or that the company is regarded as relatively risky.
