- File Transfer Protocol (FTP) is a standard set of communication rules for how computers transfer files over the Internet. A Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) standard includes rules permitting confirmed users to log onto a network to transfer files, list directories, delete and rename files. Users can also upload files and share with others through a unique link to the files through FTP.
