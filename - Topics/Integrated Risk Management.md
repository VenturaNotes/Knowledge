- IRM combines the risk management tools that a business uses. This allows organizations to centralize their risk management activities. It also lets businesses protect themselves againstÂ negative events such as downtime and cyberattacks from one easily-accessible place. IRM has six attributes:
	- Strategy: IRM enables and implements a framework that increases risk assessment performance through governance and risk ownership.
	- Assessment: This method identifies, evaluates, and prioritizes risks that could impact an organization.
	- Response: An organization can identify and implement business processes that mitigate risks.
	- Communication and reporting: An organization can identify the best methods to track and notify stakeholders about its risk response strategies.
	- Monitoring: IRM identifies and implements processes that monitor governance, accountability, compliance, and risk ownership so a company can mitigate risks across its organization.
	- Technology: Effective risk management relies on technology such as an IRM solution (IRMS).
