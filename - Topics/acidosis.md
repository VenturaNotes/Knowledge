- A condition in which the body fluids become more acidic, i.e. the pH is less than 7.4, and the capacity of the body to buffer hydrogen ions is diminished. A decrease in the elimination of carbon dioxide from the body gives rise to respiratory acidosis, while a deficiency of hydrogencarbonate results in metabolic acidosis.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a condition in which the acidity of body fluids and tissues is abnormally high. This arises because of a failure of the mechanisms responsible for maintaining a balance between acids and alkalis in the blood (see ACID-BASE BALANCE). In gaseous acidosis more than the normal amount of carbon dioxide is retained in the body, as in drowning. Patients with diabetes mellitus suffer from diabetic ketoacidosis, in which sodium, potassium, and ketone bodies are lost in the urine. See also LACTIC ACIDOSIS; RENAL TUBULAR ACIDOSIS.
