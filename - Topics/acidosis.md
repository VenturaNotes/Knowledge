- A condition in which the body fluids become more acidic, i.e. the pH is less than 7.4, and the capacity of the body to buffer hydrogen ions is diminished. A decrease in the elimination of carbon dioxide from the body gives rise to respiratory acidosis, while a deficiency of hydrogencarbonate results in metabolic acidosis.
