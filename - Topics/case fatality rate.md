- the number of fatalities from a specified disease in a given period per 100 diagnosed cases of the disease arising in the same period. Unless deaths occur very rapidly after the onset of the disease (e.g. cholera), they may be the outcome of episodes that started in an earlier period. It is possible for more people to die from a condition than to develop it during the time period under investigation. Different time periods will be appropriate depending on the disease of interest. Comparison of the annual number of admissions and fatalities in a given hospital in respect of a specific disease is known as the hospital fatality rate.
