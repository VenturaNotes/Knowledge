- $n$. Any of the large neuroglial cells shaped like many-pointed stars that support the rigid structure of the brain, mop up potassium ions during periods of intense neuronal activity, recycle glutamate and GABA after release, function as phagocytes by engulfing debris from decaying cells, and possibly play a role in the blood-brain barrier by surrounding capillaries in the brain with the terminal boutons of their dendrites. Also called astroglia. See also gliosis. \[From Greek astron a star + kytos a vessel or hollow]
