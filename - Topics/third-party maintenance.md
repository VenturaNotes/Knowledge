- Any maintenance carried out by an organization that is neither the supplier nor the owner of equipment. An advantage of TPM is that systems consisting of items from different suppliers can be maintained from a single point. However, expertise and access to spares and manuals may not be as good as when the originator of the equipment does the work.
