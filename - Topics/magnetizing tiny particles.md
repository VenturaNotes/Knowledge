## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
- Method depends on material and desired outcome
- [[Hard Disk Drives|HDDs]] use both
	- [[electromagnetic induction]]
		- Forms core mechanism for both
			- writing data
				- 
			- reading data
				- 
	- [[field-assisted recording]]
- These are fundamental to how HDDs store and retrieve data
