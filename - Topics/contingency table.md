- In statistical analysis, a frequency distribution of sample data classified by two or more factors, each with two or more classes. A simple example is a medical clinical trial of two treatments in which the number of patients assigned to each treatment is classified according to whether improvement was observed or not. If there is no significant difference between the proportions of patients improving, there is said to be no interaction between the two classifications of the table. The statistical analysis of contingency tables depends on certain assumptions (random assignment to classes, absence of other relevant factors) that make the interpretation controversial, and care must be taken in applying the tests correctly. See also CHI-SQUARED DISTRIBUTION.

- A method of presenting the frequencies of the outcomes from an experiment in which the observations in the sample are categorized according to two criteria. Each cell of the table gives the number of occurrences for a particular combination of categories. A contingency table in which individuals are categorized by gender and hair color is shown below. A final column giving the row sums and a final row giving the column sums may be added. Then the sum of the final column and the sum of the final row both equal the number in the sample.

	- If the sample is categorized according to three or more criteria, the information can be presented similarly in a number of such tables.

- $n$. A rectangular array of numbers formed by the intersection of two classification variables, showing frequencies of observations in each of its cells. For example, if the two variables are male/female and left-handed/right-handed, then the frequencies of cases in each of the four categories could be displayed in a $2 \times 2$ contingency table, that is, a contingency table with two rows and two columns.
