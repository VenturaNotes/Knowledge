- Problems that arise frequently in engineering and science and fall into two main classes. The standard (matrix) eigenvalue problem is to determine real or complex numbers,

  

$$

\lambda_{1}, \lambda_{2}, \ldots \lambda_{n} \text { (eigenvalues) }

$$

  

and corresponding nonzero vectors,

  

that satisfy the equation

  

$$

A x=\lambda x

$$

  

where $A$ is a given real or complex $n \times n$ matrix.

By analogy the continuous eigenvalue problem is to determine similar eigenvalues and corresponding nonzero functions (eigenfunctions) that satisfy the equation

  

$$

H f(x)=\lambda f(x)

$$

  

where $H$ is a given operator on functions $f$. A simple example arising from a vibratingstring problem is

  

$$

\begin{aligned}

& y^{\prime \prime}(x)=\lambda y(x) \\

& y(0)=0, y(1)=0

\end{aligned}

$$

  

where values of the parameter $\lambda$ (eigenvalues) are required that yield nontrivial eigenfunctions $y(x)$ (i.e. $y(x) \not \equiv 0$ ). Finite-difference methods applied to such problems generally lead to matrix eigenvalue problems.
