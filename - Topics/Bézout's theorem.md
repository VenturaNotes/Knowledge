- Two algebraic curves in the complex projective plane, defined by two coprime polynomials of degrees $m$ and $n$, have $m n$ intersections counting multiplicities of intersections. For example, two parallel lines still meet in one $(1 \times 1)$ point at infinity, and a parabola and one of its tangent lines meet in a multiplicity two $(2 \times 1)$ intersection.
