- (job interview) An interview with a candidate for a job in which a manager or personnel worker attempts to form a judgment of the applicant's suitability for the position in question. As basic biographical information about the candidate will already have been obtained (see BIODATA), the main purpose of the interview is usually to get an idea of his or her personality, demeanour, motivation, and interpersonal skills. The interview may be highly structured, with a large number of set questions, or virtually unstructured, to provide the candidate with more opportunity to reveal his or her qualities. The interviewer will also use the occasion to provide more information about the job, the company, and its activities.
