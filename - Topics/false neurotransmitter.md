- $n$. Any substance that is not a neuron's normal neurotransmitter but that can be taken up by the neuron, stored in its vesicles, and released along with the neuron's normal neurotransmitter when the neuron is stimulated. It may inhibit the function of the neuron if it is less effective than the normal neurotransmitter or enhance the neuron's function if it is more effective.
