- $n$. Preferred mode of cognitive processing associated with either the left or the right cerebral hemisphere predominance in thinking, feeling, and behaviour, found by MRI imaging to be associated with a thicker ventral gyrus of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) on the dominant side. Left-brained people tend to be significantly more logical, verbal, anxietyprone, and introverted than right-brained people. The term hemisphericity was coined by the US neurophysiologist Joseph E. Bogen (1926-2005) in an article in the Bulletin of the Los Angeles Neurological Society in 1969. The US neuroscientist Bruce Eldine Morton (born 1938) introduced the term hemisity in an online article in 2000. See also CEREBRAL DOMINANCE, LATERALITY. \[A contraction of hemis(pheric)ity, from Greek hemi- half + sphaira a sphere or globe + Latin -itas, indicating a state or condition]
