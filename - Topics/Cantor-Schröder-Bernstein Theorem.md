- For sets $X$ and $Y$, if $|X| \leq|Y|$ and $|Y| \leq|X|$, then $|X|$ $=|Y|$. We write $|X| \leq|Y|$ if there is a one-to-one map from $X$ to $Y$. So the theorem states that if there is an injection from $X$ to $Y$ and an injection from $Y$ to $X$, then there is a bijection between $X$ and $Y$. The theorem proves that the relation $\leq$ for cardinal numbers is antisymmetric.
