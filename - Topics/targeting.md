- Making benefits available to a particular group of people who are identified by certain characteristics. For example, child benefit in the UK is paid to parents below certain income with children aged under 16. Targeting is intended to focus the benefit on the most deserving people and to keep down the total cost of attaining a policy objective. Targeting can be done in two ways: providing benefits in kind which appeal only to particular groups, or administrative restriction of the availability of benefits in cash or in kind.
