## Source[^2]
- The acronym TIFF stands for tagged image file format. The TIFF was initially created in the 1980s as the standard file format for saving scanned images. Today, graphic designers often use TIFFs to store raster graphics for graphic design and digital/print publishing projects. TIFF files use lossless compression, meaning the original image's quality (detail and color depth) remains the same once the file is uncompressed. TIFF files can also be used as a container for other image files, allowing graphic designers and photo editors to store various JPEG images in one master graphic. However, since TIFF files are much larger than other file formats, they take a long time to load on websites and are often difficult to share. Publishing companies, graphic design companies, and photography companies typically use TIFF to publish their images due to their ability to produce high-quality print and digital images.
