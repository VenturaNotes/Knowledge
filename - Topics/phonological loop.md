- $n$. A subsystem of working memory that functions as a buffer store, holding information with the help of inner speech, as when a person mentally rehearses a telephone number over and over while searching for a pen and paper to write it down. It contains two components, a short-term phonological buffer store, holding phonologically coded information for very short periods only, and a subvocal rehearsal loop that maintains information by repeating it mentally from time to time.
