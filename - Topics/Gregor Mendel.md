- (1822-84) Austrian geneticist, who from 1843 lived as a monk in Br√ºn (now Brno, in the Czech Republic). His fame rests on the plant-breeding experiments he began in 1856, which eventually produced the rules of inheritance summarized in Mendel's laws. His work was ignored during his lifetime and only rediscovered in 1900 by Hugo de Vries and others.
