- a complex system of nerve pathways and networks in the brain, involving several different nuclei, that is involved in the expression of instinct and mood in activities of the endocrine and motor systems of the body. Among the brain regions involved are the amygdala, hippocampal formation, and hypothalamus. The activities of the body that are governed are those concerned with self-preservation (e.g. searching for food, fighting) and preservation of the species (e.g. reproduction and the care of offspring), the expression of fear, rage, and pleasure, and the establishment of memory patterns. See also RETICULAR ACTIVATING SYSTEM.
## Source[^3]
- A group of regions in the brain that is involved in the expression and control of emotions, mood, instinct, and fear and plays a major role in long-term memory. The limbic system represents the evolutionarily primitive parts of the forebrain and includes the hippocampus, hypothalamus, thalamus, and amygdala. It contains centers for pleasure and pain that play roles in the development of desires and drives and also in learning and emotional memory.

- $n$. A ring of cortical and subcortical structures folded into the inner surface of the temporal lobe surrounding the brainstem and bordering on the corpus callosum, including the amygdala, cingulate gyrus, fornix, hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and septum pellucidum, implicated in basic emotions, hunger, sex, and memory. See also Papez circuit, pleasure center. \[From Latin limbicus bordering, from limbus a border]
