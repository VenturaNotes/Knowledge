- $n$. an institution providing medical or psychiatric care and treatment of patients. Such care may be residential (in-patient), including the care of patients for a whole day and their return home at night (day care). Out-patient services include consultation with specialists by prior appointment, X-rays, laboratory tests, physiotherapy, and accident and emergency services for those requiring urgent care. Most health districts have a district general hospital (DGH), which provides sufficient basic services for the population of the district. Some larger hospitals have resources that are more highly specialized, to meet the needs of a wider population, providing so-called regional or supraregional (national) services. Such hospitals often provide training for medical students (teaching or university hospitals) and for postgraduate education. Some smaller hospitals - known as community hospitals - may be staffed by general practitioners and are intended for people for whom home care is not practicable on social grounds. Within the NHS, individual hospitals or groups of hospitals are generally part of foundation trusts, deriving their income largely from contracts with clinical commissioning groups. There are also around 400 private hospitals in the UK, which operate outside of the NHS, though some are contracted to provide some NHS services.
