- The act of assigning initial values to variables before the start of a computation. Many programming languages provide a facility for specifying initial values when a variable is first declared.

## Source[^3]
- Initialization is a term used in the computer programming industry to describe the process of assigning a value to a data variable. In a business setting, the initialization process occurs when an IT administrator first installs a computer program onto a company system. As the computer program loads into the computerʻs memory, it looks into the computer memoryʻs initialization files and switches out definite values for variable values. This allows the installed  software program to execute properly.
