- A chart showing the relative frequencies with which a measurable quantity takes values in a set of contiguous intervals. The chart consists of rectangles whose areas are proportional to the relative frequencies and whose widths are proportional to the class intervals. It can be used to picture a frequency distribution.
## Source[^2]
- A graph of a frequency distribution constructed with rectangles, in which the areas of the rectangles are proportional to the frequencies.
## Source[^3]
- A graphical representation of a table showing the frequencies or proportions of observations falling in each of several specified categories, usually the sub-intervals (bins) of the range of observed values. It is the simplest non-parametric estimate of the population distribution of the variable under consideration.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. a form of statistical graph in which values are plotted in the form of rectangles on a chart; a bar-chart.
