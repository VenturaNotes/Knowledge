## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The products of photosynthesis. The net output of the Calvin-BasshamBenson cycle is the three-carbon compound glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is exported from the chloroplast to the cytosol of the cell. This undergoes condensation reactions to form the six carbon compounds fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and glucose 1-phosphate, which via a further condensation form the 12-carbon disaccharide sucrose. Some glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate can also be converted to amino acids and fats, but sucrose is the main form in which carbohydrate is exported from photosynthesizing cells to the rest of the plant and hence the most abundant photosynthate.
