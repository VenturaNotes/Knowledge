- $n$. A plane curve whose equation is $r=a \theta$ in polar coordinates, meaning that the length of the curve's radius $r$ from its centre is always a constant ratio of the angle that the radius forms with a fixed axis, and as a consequence the coils of the spiral are a constant distance apart like the grooves of old-fashioned vinyl phonograph records, which are in fact Archimedes spirals. The term is sometimes used as a synonym for a Plateau spiral, but this is avoided in careful usage because a Plateau spiral is merely a device based on it and often on some other spiral. Also called an Archimedean spiral. \[Named after the ancient Greek mathematician and physicist Archimedes of Syracuse (?287-212 BC) who was the first to study it and whose treatise On Spirals is devoted mainly to it]
