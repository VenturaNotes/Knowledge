- (Holmes-Adie syndrome) an abnormality of the pupils of the eyes, often affecting only one eye. The affected pupil is dilated and reacts slowly to light; the response on convergence accommodation of the eyes is also slow (see TONIC PUPIL). Tendon reflexes may be absent. The condition is almost entirely restricted to women. \[W. J. Adie; Sir G. M. Holmes (1876-1965), British neurologist]
