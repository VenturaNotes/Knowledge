- Physical geography maps show height contours$\textemdash$curves of equal height$\textemdash$and weather charts show pressure isobars$\textemdash$curves of equal pressure. More generally, for a function $f(x,y)$, the contour lines are the level sets with equation $f(x,y) = c$, where $c$ is a constant value (in the image of $f$). A sketch of such contour lines is called a contour plot.
