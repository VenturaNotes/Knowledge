- A bank credit that is negotiated for a specified period; it allows for drawdown and repayment within that period. Repaid amounts can be redrawn up to the agreed limit of the credit. At the end of the loan period there is a bullet repayment of the principal and any outstanding interest; alternatively, a repayment schedule is negotiated for the outstanding principal and interest. In the USA a revolving credit is called an open-end credit. See also convertible revolving CREDIT.
