- A logic circuit, usually an integrated circuit, that is capable of setting one of its $2^{n}$ output lines active, i.e. at logic 1 , in response to an $n$-bit binary code present at its input. For an $n$-bit device, $2^{n}$ distinct elements of a code can be input.
- A decoder/demultiplexer may be considered as a switch that directs data from a timeshared data bus to one of several possible outputs under the control of a select signal, which is normally digital; the select signal indicates which of the outputs is to be connected to the input (see diagram). Individual data channels may be recovered from a time-division multiplexed input bus provided that the scanning of the select signal is made synchronous with that of the multiplexer. The input to and outputs from a decoder/demultiplexer may be in digital or analogue form. See also DATA SELECTOR/MULTIPLEXER.
