- (GLP-1) a hormone $\textendash$ an incretin $\textendash$ that is produced in the small intestine. GLP-1 has a half-life in the blood circulation of less than two minutes due to rapid breakdown by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV). It is a potent antihyperglycaemic hormone, stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells in response to a rising blood glucose level after eating. This glucose-sensitive action also allows the effect of GLP-1 on the beta cells to switch off when the blood glucose level comes down to the normal baseline between meals. Thus the GLP-1 receptor agonist group of drugs, used in type 2 diabetes, can restrict the rise in blood glucose level after meals but have a low risk of causing subsequent hypoglycaemia.
