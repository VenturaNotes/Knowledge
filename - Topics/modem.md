## Synthesis
- A modem is the initial point which receives signals from your internet provider. It then transmits these signals to a router so the internet is accessible wirelessly.
## Source [^1]
- Allows computers to transfer data using a [[telephone line]]
## Source[^2]
- The modem connects your computer to the internet

- The modem is a communication device that allows digital devices, such as computers, to connect to the Internet over a standard telephone line, cable line, or fiber optic line.

	- #question What is the difference between a telephone line, cable line, or fiber optic line

- A modem acts as the initial point that receives signals from your cable internet provider. It converts these signals into a readable format and transmits them to the router, making the Internet accessible wirelessly.
	- #question What is meant by signals here? What kind of signal is it? Does it have to be decoded as well? Are the signals provided by the ISP just all encoded? What stops someone from hijacking ISP signals? Would it be possible to use ISP signals without a subscription to their service? How can you monetize wavelengths?

	- #question what is an internet service provider and what are some examples? 
	- #question is a cable internet provider different from an ISP?
	- #question Will the router always provide internet wirelessly? Are there routers which require a cable to work? 
	- #question Does a modem always need a cable?

- (modulator and demodulator) A device that can convert a digital bit stream into an analogue signal suitable for transmission over some analogue communication channel (modulation), and can convert incoming analogue signals back into digital signals (demodulation). Modems are used to connect digital devices across analogue transmission lines. Most modems are designed to match specific national or international standards so that data communication equipment from one manufacturer can talk to that of another.
- Modems can be packaged in many ways: as add-in cards or PC cards allowing personal computers to communicate over ordinary phone lines, as small external units, or as rack-mounted sets for large applications requiring many simultaneous connections. Modern modems, for attachment to a normal telephone line, can handle data at 56000 bps, which is about the upper limit attainable over voice-frequency channels. Broadband modems allow users to connect at speeds of several gigabits per second using ADSL or similar services.

- Abbreviation for modulator-demodulator, a device that enables a computer to transmit and receive data by means of a communications link, such as a telephone line. The process of converting computer signals into a form suitable for transmission is called modulation. The reverse process, making the transmitted signals intelligible to the computer, is called demodulation. Modems provide access to the telephone network for e-mail and for the Internet.
