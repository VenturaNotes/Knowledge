## Source [^1]
- (n-3 fatty acids) polyunsaturated fatty acids with a double bond at the third carbon atom in the chain. Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for brain development and are also associated with many health benefits, including protection against heart disease and possibly stroke and inflammatory conditions. There are three major types: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). The main source of EPA and DHA is fish oils. Vegetarians rely on EPA and DHA being synthesized by the body from dietary sources of ALA. See also ESSENTIAL FATTY ACIDS.
