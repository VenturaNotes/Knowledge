## Source [^1]
- $n$. A chemical closely related to tyrosine that attaches to the enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase, preventing the enzyme from metabolizing tyrosine into dopa, causing a decrease in the synthesis of dopa, and therefore also of the catecholamines dopamine, adrenalin (epinephrine), and noradrenalin (norepinephrine). AMPT abbrev.
