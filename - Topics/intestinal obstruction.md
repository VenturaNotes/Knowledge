- partial or complete blockage of the bowel producing symptoms of vomiting, distension, and abdominal pain due to failure to pass intestinal contents. Causes may be mechanical or nonmechanical (see ILEUS). Acute obstruction may be due to incarcerated hernias, adhesions, or malignancy; chronic obstruction may be secondary to tumors, strictures, anatomical abnormality, or neurological disease. Conservative management is by intravenous fluid replacement and nasogastric decompression ('drip and suck'). Most cases of mechanical obstruction require surgical intervention.
