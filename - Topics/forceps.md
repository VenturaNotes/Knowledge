- $n$. a pincer-like instrument designed to grasp an object so that it can be held firm or pulled. Specially designed forceps - of which there are many varieties - are used by surgeons and dentists in operations (see illustration). The forceps used in childbirth are so designed as to fit firmly round the baby's head without damaging it. Dental extraction forceps are specially designed to fit the various shapes of teeth. By having long handles and short beaks they provide considerable leverage.
