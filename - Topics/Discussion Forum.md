- A discussion forum is an internet-based group. It can take many forms, including online bulletin boards or subreddits. These discussion forums usually allow users to exchange ideas and have conversations. Discussion forums typically enable users to select usernames, upload other media, and respond in threaded discussions to others. Forums can contain meaningful conversations. However, they may also feature anonymous insults and dishonest statements, so professionals who use discussion forums should do so with caution.
