The stones are either formed in the bladder, due to obstruction, urinary statis, and infection (primary calculi), or pass to the bladder after being formed in the kidneys (secondary calculi). They cause pain, the passage of bloody urine, and interruption of the urinary stream and should be removed surgically. See CALCULUS.
