- Mechanics is, in general, concerned with two forms of energy: kinetic energy and potential energy. When there is a transference of energy of one of these forms into energy of another form such as heat or noise, there may be a loss of energy.
- Energy has dimensions $ML^2T^{-2}$, and the SI unit of measurement is the joule.
