## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Mechanics is, in general, concerned with two forms of energy: kinetic energy and potential energy. When there is a transference of energy of one of these forms into energy of another form such as heat or noise, there may be a loss of energy.
- Energy has dimensions $ML^2T^{-2}$, and the SI unit of measurement is the joule.
## Source[^2]
- A measure of a system's ability to do work. Like work itself, it is measured in joules. Energy is conveniently classified into two forms: potential energy is the energy stored in a body or system as a consequence of its position, shape, or state (this includes chemical energy in food substances, etc.); kinetic energy is energy of motion and is usually defined as the work that will be done by the body possessing the energy when it is brought to rest.
