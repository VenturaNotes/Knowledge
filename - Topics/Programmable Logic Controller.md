- Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) can control machinery or processes based on inputs from sensors and other equipment. They are often used in industrial applications to monitor the status of production lines, manufacturing stations, or assembly processes such as heat-sealing packaging operations. PLCs take data from various sources, including human operators and environmental conditions such as temperature readings outside an air conditioning system's cooling coils. They then process these inputs through a series of steps before determining if any action needs to be taken by their attached components.
