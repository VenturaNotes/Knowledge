- $n$. In statistics, a method of multiple comparisons in which the group means are ranked from smallest to largest, and then the number of steps that two means are apart in this ranking is used to compute a range statistic for each comparison. Compare Bonferroni correction, least-significant difference test, Newman-Keuls test, Scheff√© test, Tukey-HSD test. \[Named after the Australian-born US statistician David Beattie Duncan (1916-2006) who developed it in 1955]
