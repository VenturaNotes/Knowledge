- (RAROC) A measure of the performance of units within a bank or financial organization, be they managerial units, products, distributional units, or such treasury-based units as trading desks. It was developed by Bankers' Trust and the Bank of America in the 1980s. In its most common form RAROC allocates capital to a unit and divides that into the return obtained from the unit. The capital is allocated in terms of a value-at-risk methodology. A refinement of this system is known as RAROC 2020.
