- Web analytics refers to the analysis of visitor data for web pages. This data could be the time a visitor spends on a page, the number of page views, the links clicked on, and more. Website owners review analytics regularly to determine what content works and what doesn't. Most web hosting software solutions have an analytics suite that allows website owners to get this information.
