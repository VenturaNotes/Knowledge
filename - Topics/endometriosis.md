- $n$. the presence of fragments of endometrial tissue at sites in the pelvis outside the uterus or, rarely, throughout the body (e.g. in the lung, rectum, or umbilicus). It is thought to be caused by retrograde menstruation. When the tissue has infiltrated the wall of the uterus (myometrium) the condition is known as adenomyosis. Symptoms vary, but typically include pelvic pain, severe dysmenorrhoea, dyspareunia, infertility, and a pelvic mass (or any combination of these). Medical treatment is aimed at suppressing ovulation using gonadorelin analogues, combined oral contraceptives, or the intrauterine system (see IUS). Highdose progestogens suppress gonadotrophins (FSH and LH), shrink implanted endometrial tissue, and reduce retrograde menstruation. They have a similar efficacy to other medical treatments, are cheaper, and have fewer side-effects than gonadorelin analogues. Surgical treatment may also be necessary, usually by laser or ablative therapy via the laparoscope. More radical surgical treatment in the form of a total hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy is sometimes required.
