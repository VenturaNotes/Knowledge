- A strategy in which a business chooses to operate in a narrow area of the market and to specialize within these constraints. Such an approach was recognized as one of three generic strategies by Michael Porter in 1980. He further defined two types of focus strategy: the first, cost focus, aims to give the business cost advantage in its target market; the second, differentiation focus, seeks to distinguish its product within the defined sector. Compare DIFFERENTIATION STRATEGY; LOW-COST STRATEGY.
