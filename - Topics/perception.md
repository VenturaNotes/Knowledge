- An interpretation process in which raw sensory signals are converted into meaningful symbols. Human perception is still poorly understood but inspires research into image understanding, pattern recognition, and other intelligent systems that attempt to convert complex sensory data into meaningful interpretations of objects and events in the world. Related philosophical problems include the symbol grounding problem, which concerns the semantic content of symbols and how they are related to sensation.

- $n$. The act, process, or product of perceiving, the ability or capacity to perceive, or a particular way of perceiving (Newspapers influenced the public's perception of Princess Diana). In psychology, a distinction is conventionally drawn between sensation, the subjective experience or feeling that results from excitation of sensory receptors, and perception, sensory experience that has been interpreted with reference to its presumed external stimulus object or event, this distinction having first been made in 1785 by Thomas Reid (1710-96), founder of the Scottish school of psychological philosophy, who pointed out that the agreeable fragrance of a rose is merely a sensation inasmuch as it can be experienced without thinking of a rose or of any other object, whereas the perception of a rose or of anything else always refers to the external object that is its cause. Compare apperception. perceive $v b$. To engage in perception. perceptual adj. Of or relating to perception. \[From Latin percipere, perceptum to perceive, from per through or thoroughly + capere, ceptum to take + -ion indicating an action, process, or state]
