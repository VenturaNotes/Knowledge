In psychoanalysis, a complex (2), closely linked with the Oedipus complex, focusing on fantasies of one's penis being cut off, evoked in a child by the discovery of the anatomical difference between the sexes. In a boy, it induces anxiety about being castrated and initiates the latency period; in a girl, it is experienced as a loss that she has suffered and initiates a desire for the paternal penis and attempts to deny or compensate for the loss. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced the concept in 1908 in an article 'On the Sexual Theories of Children' (Standard Edition, IX, pp. 209-26, at pp. 215-17) and developed it further in his famous case of Little Hans, 'Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-Year-Old Boy', first published in 1909 (Standard Edition, X, pp. 5-149).
