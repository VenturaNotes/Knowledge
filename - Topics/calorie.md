## Source [^1]
- $n$. a unit commonly defined as the approximate amount of energy required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ at atmospheric pressure. The energy value of foods should be expressed in kilocalories (one kilocalorie (kcal) is equal to 1000 calories). The SI unit is the joule: 1 calorie $=4.1855$ joules. The average adult requires 1994 kcal (women) or 2250 kcal (men) per day.
## Source[^2]
- The quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 gram of water by $1^{\circ} \mathrm{C}(1 K$). The calorie, a c.g.s. unit, is now largely replaced by the joule, an SI unit. 1 calorie $=4.1868$ joules.

- Calorie: (kilogram calorie; kilocalorie) 1000 calories. This unit is still in limited use in estimating the energy value of foods, but is obsolescent.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A unit of heat, energy, or food value, equal to 1,000 calories (with lower-case initial $c$, see below). Also (preferably) called a kilocalorie, a large calorie, or a kilogram calorie. Cal. or kcal abbrev. calorie $n$. Formerly defined as the heat required to raise the temperature of one gram of water by one degree centigrade, now defined in standard SI units as 4.1868 joules. Also called a small calorie or gram calorie . cal. abbrev. There is much confusion, calorie often being written when Calorie is meant. In psychology, and in writing about food and nutrition, calorie usually denotes kilocalorie. caloric or calorific adj. \[From Latin calor heat]
