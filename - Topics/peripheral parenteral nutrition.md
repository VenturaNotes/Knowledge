- (PPN) the delivery of nutrients directly into a peripheral vein (in the arm). Feed solutions must have a low osmolality ( $<1200 ~\mathrm{mOsm} / \mathrm{l}$ ), and PPN can be given only for a short period (less than four weeks). There is a risk of phlebitis. See ARTIFICIAL NUTRITION AND HYDRATION; TOTAL PARENTERAL NUTRITION.
