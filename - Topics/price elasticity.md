- Price elasticity measures how demand changes in response to price changes
## Source[^2]
- The ratio of a proportional change in quantity supplied or demanded to a proportional change in price. The price elasticity of supply is $\varepsilon_{s}=(p / q)(d q / d p)$, where $p$ is price and $q$ is quantity. The price elasticity of demand is often defined as $\varepsilon_{d}=-(p / q)(d q / d p)$ so that it is positive, but the minus sign is not universally used.
