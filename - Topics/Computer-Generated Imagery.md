- CGI (computer-generated imagery) is the act of using computer graphics to create or add imagery to art, video games, films, television programs, videos, and other forms of media. There are many different CGI generation methods, which include using computer algorithms to generate fractals that create complex visual patterns, using vector-based image editors to make shapes into images, and using ray tracing or rasterized 3D to create realistic digital imagery.
