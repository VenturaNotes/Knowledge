- Multitasking refers to a person or machine performing more than one task at once. The term multitasking originated in a computing context. Computers have evolved to be able to run multiple applications at the same time, ultimately completing more work in less time. An example of human multitasking is participating in a video conference while responding to an email. Although business professionals multitask to get more done in a shorter period of time and get ahead, in some cases, multitasking may work against them. Multitasking among humans has resulted in poor performance in school or the workplace. While multitasking, people are retaining less information since they are not giving all of their attention to just one thing.
