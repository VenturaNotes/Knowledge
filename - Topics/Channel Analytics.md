- Channel analytics is the superordinate of web analytics, and identifies trends and patterns from online and offline channels. These include digital technologies (email, social media, SMS, etc.), as well as direct mail, customer contact centers, mass media, and brick-and-mortar store and branch locations. Channel analytics examine factors such as integrity, costs, usage, efficiency, and integration with other systems. They also investigate the value of each channel separately and in relation to each other.
