- $n$. a plastic container with a mouthpiece at one end and a hole for an aerosol inhaler at the other. The dose from the inhaler is sprayed into the spacer, from which it can be inhaled without needing to coordinate breathing. It is particularly useful for babies and small children who do not have this coordination. Paediatric spacers also have a small mask that fits onto the mouthpiece of the spacer and is placed over the child's nose and mouth. Spacers help to deliver a greater proportion of the dose to the airways while reducing the proportion absorbed into the body (which is the usual cause of unwanted side-effects)
