## Source [^1]
- Type casting and [[type conversion]] are typically used interchangeably but may have a subtle difference in some programming communities
	- Type casting typically refers to explicit conversion from one type to another 
	- In Python, `int("123")` explicitly casts a string to an integer
- Tends to emphasize explicit changes made by the programmer
