## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- In the context of [[complex numbers]], "absolute value" and "modulus" are the same thing
	- Refers to magnitude or distance of a complex number from the origin in the [[complex plane]]
## Source[^2]
- Absolute value is a mathematical concept that represents the distance of a number from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. In the context of price [[elasticity]] of demand, absolute value is crucial because it allows economists to focus on the magnitude of elasticity, ignoring whether demand is elastic or inelastic. This is important for understanding consumer behavior and how quantity demanded responds to price changes
## Source[^3]
- Absolute value is a term used in mathematics to indicate the distance of a point or number from the origin (zero point) of a number line or coordinate system.
## Source[^4]
- The magnitude of a number, regardless of its sign (positive or negative). For example, 25 is the absolute value of 25 and -25 . Most spreadsheet programs include a function that returns the absolute value of a number.
## Source[^5]
- For any real number $a$, the absolute value (also called the modulus) of $a$, denoted by $|a|$, is $a$ itself if $a \geq 0$, and $-a$ if $a \leq 0$. Thus $|a|$ is positive except when $a=0$. The following properties hold:

(i) $|a b|=|a||b|$.

(ii) $|a+b| \leq|a|+|b|$.

(iii) $|a-b| \geq||a|-|b||$.

(iv) For $a>0,|x| \leq a$ if and only if $-a \leq x \leq a$.

(ii) is the triangle inequality and (iii) is sometimes known as the reverse triangle inequality.
