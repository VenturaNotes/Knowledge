- A molecule with the shape of a polyhedron. Examples, which occur in both organic and inorganic chemistry, include certain boranes, carboranes, and cluster compounds. It is possible to have molecules with more than one polyhedron. The question of which polyhedral molecules are stable can frequently be answered by electron counting rules.
