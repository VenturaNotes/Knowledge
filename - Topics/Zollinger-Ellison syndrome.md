- a rare disorder in which there is excessive secretion of gastric juice due to high levels of circulating gastrin, which is produced by a pancreatic tumor (see GASTRINOMA) or an enlarged pancreas. The high levels of stomach acid cause diarrhoea and peptic ulcers, which may be multiple, in unusual sites (e.g. jejunum), or which may quickly recur after vagotomy or partial gastrectomy. Treatment with proton-pump inhibitors, by removal of the tumor (if benign), or by total gastrectomy is usually effective. \[R. M. Zollinger (1903-92) and E. H. Ellison (1918-70), US physicians]
