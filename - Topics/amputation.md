- $n$. the removal of a limb, part of a limb, or any other portion of the body (such as a breast or the rectum). The term is customarily modified by an adjective showing the particular type of amputation. Examples include above-knee, through-knee, and below-knee amputations of the lower limb. Limb amputation may be performed for gangrene or severe infections precipitated by conditions such as severe peripheral vascular disease or diabetes mellitus, where other techniques are not possible. It is also performed in cases of severe limb injury. In planning an amputation the surgeon takes account of the blood supply, the patient's mobility, and the type of artificial part (prosthesis) that will be fitted. It is not uncommon for patients to continue to have physical sensations in the body part that has been removed (phantom limb).
