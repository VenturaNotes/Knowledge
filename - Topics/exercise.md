- $n$. any activity resulting in physical exertion that is intended to maintain physical fitness, to condition the body, or to correct a physical deformity. Exercises may be done actively by the person or passively by a therapist. Aerobic exercises are intended to increase oxygen consumption (as in running) and to benefit the lungs and cardiovascular system, in contrast to isometric exercises. In isotonic exercises, the muscles contract and there is movement, but the force remains the same; this improves joint mobility and muscle strength.
