## Source [^1]
- A disk subsystem comprising a collection of disk drives together with [[array management software]] that controls the drives so that they are seen by the host operating software as one or more virtual disk drives. The array management software may reside in the host system or in the disk subsystem, in which case it is better described as firmware. A disk that is under the control of array management software is known as a member disk. See also RAID.
