- The pigments responsible for the capture of light energy during the light-dependent reactions of photosynthesis. In plants, algae, and cyanobacteria the green pigment chlorophyll $a$ is the primary pigment, absorbing blue and red light (see PHOTOSYSTEMS I AND II). The carotenoids and various other pigments are accessory pigments, absorbing light energy and passing this on to the chlorophyll $a$ molecules. Other photosynthetic bacteria use various types of bacteriochlorophyll. See also BACTERIORHODOPSIN.
