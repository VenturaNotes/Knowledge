- $n$. In statistics, a technique for analyzing frequency (2) data to investigate the relationships among the variables in a cross-tabulation by modelling the logarithm of the frequency in a cell as a function of main effect and interaction effects. Unlike the chi-square test, log-linear analysis is capable of analyzing the effects of more than one independent variable on a dependent variable and of estimating not only main effects but also interaction effects. See also multiway frequency ANALYSIS, SATURATION (2).
