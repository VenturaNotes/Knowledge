## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Arithmetic logic unit. A component of the processor that performs arithmetic operations and logical comparisons.
## Source[^2]
- An arithmetic-logic unit (ALU) is the part of a central processing unit (CPU) that carries out arithmetic and logic operations on the operands in computer instruction words.
## Source[^3]
- A portion of the central processor that generally forms functions of (usually) two input values and produces a single output result. These functions usually consist of the common arithmetic operations, the common logic operations, and shift operations. Associated with the ALU is a condition-code register that holds certain properties of the result of the most recent ALU operation (see also PROGRAM STATUS WORD).
- Arithmetic unit (AU) is short for arithmetic and logic unit.
