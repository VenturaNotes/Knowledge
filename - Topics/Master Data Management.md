- MDM, or master data management, consists of all processes, technology, and tools that are used to gather raw data and transform it to a single source of information. Through this process, SMBs' most sensitive and critical data can be stored, categorized, synchronized, and improved. MDM relies heavily on machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) to identify master data and integrate it where it is needed, across many different business applications. In addition to ensuring the quality of data, MDM can improve compliance, customer experience, and overall levels and quality of productivity.
