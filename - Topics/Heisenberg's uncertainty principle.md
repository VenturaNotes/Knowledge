- The principle in quantum theory stated by Werner Heisenberg in 1927 which says that it is not possible to simultaneously determine the position and momentum of a particle. Mathematically, this means that the momentum observable P and the position observable X do not commute or, more precisely $\Delta_\uppsi(P)\Delta_\uppsi(X) \ge h/2$, where $\Delta_\uppsi$ denotes dispersion of a wave function $\psi$, and h is the reduced Planck's constant.
