- multiprogramming system A system in which several individual programs may be active. Each active program implies a running process, so there may be several processes, but only one process runs at any one time on any particular processor. It is perfectly feasible to run a multiprogramming system containing only one processor. A multiprocessing system, containing several processors, will also be a multiprogramming system.
