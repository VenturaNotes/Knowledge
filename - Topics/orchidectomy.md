- $n$. surgical removal of a testis. A radical orchidectomy, using an incision in the inguinal region, is performed for malignant tumors within the testis (usually germ-cell tumors, such as seminoma or teratoma). Orchidectomy may also be performed for infarction of the testis. Removal of both testes (bilateral orchidectomy: see CASTRATION) causes sterility and reduces levels of testosterone by $90 \%$, which is an effective treatment for advanced prostate cancer.
