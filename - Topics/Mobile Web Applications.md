- Mobile web applications are programs made for cell phones, laptops, tablets, or other mobile devices. The unique thing about mobile web applications is that they only require a web browser to be downloaded, and aren't exclusive to one particular kind of device or operating system. Mobile web applications differ from mobile apps created for specific operating systems.
