## Source[^2]
- The destruction of a living cell. This may be effected by lysosomes or lymphocytes, either as part of the normal metabolic process (as when cells are damaged or worn out) or as a reaction against invading cells (e.g. bacteria). Bacteriophages eventually cause lysis of their host cells. Experimentally, lysis of cells in culture or suspension is achieved by various methods, including mechanical disruption by a blender or ultrasonic waves in a sonicator.
