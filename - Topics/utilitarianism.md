- An ethical doctrine that judges the value of an action by its contribution to overall utility. 'The greatest good of the greatest number' was a slogan of the originator of this school of thought, Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832). A utilitarian attempts to tackle the question of to what extent the state should control and to what extent respect private property by considering its usefulness and defects as a framework for economic activity, rather than asking how rules are related to either divine commandments or 'natural rights'. The utilitarian social welfare function captures this doctrine by expressing welfare as the sum of individual utilities$$\mathrm{W}=\sum_{h=1}^{H} U^{h}$$where $U^{h}$ is the utility of individual $h$, and $H$ is the number of individuals in the population.
