- (two-way linked list, symmetric list) A linked list where each item contains links to both its predecessor and its successor. This makes it possible to traverse the list in either direction. The flexibility given by double linking must be offset against the overhead of the storage and the setting and resetting of the extra links involved when items are inserted or removed.
