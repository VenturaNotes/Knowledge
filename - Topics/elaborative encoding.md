- Elaborative encoding is a method for improving memory through verbal or visual associations and explanations
- Definition
	- Elaborative encoding is based on the idea that thoughts and concepts can be better stored in the brain through forming associations between related pieces of information, attaching explanations to newly acquired facts, and actively engaging with material by creating meaningful categories
- Example
	- Studying: When learning new things, we typically use elaborative encoding to associate new material with previously-learned content. Doing on, we can better remember and recall the information because it is now associated with something we know well.
