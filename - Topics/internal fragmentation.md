- A form of fragmentation that arises when allocations of memory are made only in multiples of a subunit. A request of arbitrary size must be met by rounding up to the next highest multiple of the subunit, leaving a small amount of memory that is allocated but not in use. Internal fragmentation is reduced by reducing the size of the subunit; such a reduction increases external fragmentation.
