- $n$. A theory of pain, put forward by the Canadian psychologist Ronald Melzack (born 1929) and the US-based English anatomist Patrick D(avid) Wall (1925-2001) in an article in the journal Science in 1965, according to which pain signals transmitted by smalldiameter nerve fibers may be blocked at the level of the spinal cord and prevented from reaching the brain by the firing of larger sensory nerve fibers, which act as a gate without normally transmitting pain signals themselves. Chronic pain occurs when disease, injury, or infection damage the large fibers that normally close the gate so that pain messages are not blocked on their path to the brain. According to this theory, acupuncture anaesthesia may work by stimulating large-diameter sensory nerves to close the spinal gates.
