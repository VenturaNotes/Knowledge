- An estimator of the vector of the parameters in a model with panel data, computed as an ordinary least squares estimator using the deviations from the time averages of the data for each cross-section unit (deviations from group means). It is equivalent to estimating a model with dummy variables for each unit (the least squares dummy variable, or LSDV, model). See also BETWEEN-GROUPS ESTIMATOR.
