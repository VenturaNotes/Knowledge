- $n$. a biopharmaceutical (biologic) created to be very similar to a product already approved for clinical use whose patent has expired. Owing to their molecular complexity, it is not possible to produce identical (generic) versions of biological products. However, a growing number of biosimilars have been approved since the mid-2000s on the basis that they have no clinically meaningful differences from the original product.
