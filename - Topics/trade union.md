- An organization whose principal purposes include the regulation of relations between employees and employers or employers' associations. A house (or company) union is an association of employees all belonging to the same company, which will probably have no connection with the trade union movement. An industrial (or general) union has members who work in the same industry; it is usually very large. A craft union is a small union of skilled workers. Unions' affairs are now regulated by the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. This provides that secret ballots must be held for election of unions' executive committees and before any industrial action backed by the union is taken. The Act gives a right to trade union members not to be unjustifiably disciplined by their union (for example for failing to take industrial action). A member can apply to an employment tribunal for a declaration that he or she has been unjustifiably disciplined.
