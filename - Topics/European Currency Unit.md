- (Ecu) A unit of account introduced by the European Economic Community when forming the European Monetary System in 1979. The Ecu was a form of international money used by various official European bodies in their accounting, but very little by other financial markets. Its value was equal to a weighted average of the currencies of several member countries. The Ecu was superseded by the euro, when this was adopted in 1999.
