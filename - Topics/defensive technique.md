- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a concept introduced by the Scottish psychoanalyst W. Ronald D. Fairbairn (1889-1964) to denote any of four different processes that occur during normal development, in the transition to quasi-independence, as a result of splitting of the object (the mother or breast) into a good object that satisfies and a bad object that frustrates. The particular technique adopted depends on where (internally or externally) the good object and the bad object are located, and this also explains the form that a mental disorder is likely to take if development does not proceed normally. See hYSTERICAL TECHNIQUE, OBSESSIONAL TECHNIQUE, PARANOID TECHNIQUE, PHOBIC TECHNIQUE.
