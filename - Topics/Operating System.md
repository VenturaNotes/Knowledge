- An operating system (OS) is the software that manages all of a computer or device resources, including hardware and programs. The OS controls the stream of information that goes to and from the main processor and allows users to communicate with their device without having to learn code or a computer or programming language. Once an OS has been loaded on a device, it can access, coordinate, and run that device's software and hardware, as well as access its storage and memory.

- An operating system is software loaded onto a computer or device by a boot program. Operating systems manage all computer hardware and software resources, allowing users to communicate with their devices without having to possess knowledge of their computerʻs programming language.
- Computer applications use an application program interface (API) or a graphical user interface (GUI) to issue service requests to their deviceʻs respective operating system. Operating systems typically come preloaded on computers and other devices, and are often only compatible with certain brands.
- For example, Apple computers are compatible with Mac operating systems (MacOS) and Apple smartphones use iOS. Most other computer brands are compatible with Windows operating systems.
