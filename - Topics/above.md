- Greater than. The limit of a function at $a$ from above is the limit of $f(x)$ as $x \rightarrow a$ for values of $x>a$. It can be written as $f\left(a^{+}\right)$or $\lim _{x \searrow a} f(x)$. A function $f(x)$ is continuous at $a$ if and only if the limit from above and the limit from below exist and are equal.
