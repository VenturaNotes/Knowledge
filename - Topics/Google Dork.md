- A Google dork query uses advanced search operators to locate hard-to-find information. Search operators are modifiers that apply limitations to a search, such as particular sites, file types, or text phrases. As Google crawls websites, everything available on the site is indexed, even content not intended to be public. Cybercriminals use Google dorking to find website vulnerabilities and expose sensitive data.
