- Line of business (or LOB) is a generic term that refers to the industry that a company services. It describes the product or service that is provided by a company so that the business can be categorized into a more specific area. For instance, a company that sells car insurance would fall under the “insurance” line of business while one that manufacturers medical devices would be classified as "health care."
