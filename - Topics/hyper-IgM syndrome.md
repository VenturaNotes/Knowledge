- an inherited immunodeficiency syndrome characterized by normal or high IgM levels with absence of $\operatorname{IgA}, \operatorname{IgG}$, and IgE (see IMMUNOGLOBULIN). Patients are susceptible to bacterial and opportunistic infections. Some cases are due to a mutation in the gene encoding the CD40 ligand, which is synthesized by helper T cells and is involved in activation of B cells to produce circulating antibodies.
