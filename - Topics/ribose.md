## Source [^1]
- $n$. a pentose sugar (i.e. one with free carbon atoms) that is a component of RNA and several coenzymes. Ribose is also involved in intracellular metabolism.
## Source[^2]
- A monosaccharide, $\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{10} \mathrm{O}_{5}$, rarely occurring free in nature but important as a component of RNA (ribonucleic acid). Its derivative deoxyribose, $\mathrm{C}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{10} \mathrm{O}_{4}$, is equally important as a constituent of DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid), which carries the genetic code in chromosomes.
