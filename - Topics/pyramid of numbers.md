- A diagramatic representation of the numbers of animals found in an area at ascending trophic levels of a food chain (see illustration). Because only a small proportion of the energy taken in by an organism is converted to tissue and is thus available to consumers at the next trophic level, the number of organisms that can be supported at each level is generally much less than the number at the level that supplies its food (i.e. the level below). See also PYRAMID OF BIOMASS; PYRAMID OF ENERGY.
