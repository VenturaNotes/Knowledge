- $n$. The argument first advanced by the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711-76) in section IV, part I of his Inquiry Concerning Human Understanding, that the only legitimate sources of knowledge or belief are reason and empirical evidence, an often-quoted synopsis of the argument occurring at the end of the book: 'If we take in our hand any volume; of divinity or school metaphysics, for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but sophistry and illusion' (section XII, part III, italics in original). In logical positivism, a strong form of Hume's fork was used as a criterion for distinguishing sense from nonsense, the assumption being that any assertion that failed the test was literally nonsensical. See also empiricism, RATIONALISM (1).
