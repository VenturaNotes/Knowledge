- adj. prone to respond abnormally to the presence of a particular antigen, which may cause a variety of tissue reactions ranging from serum sickness to an allergy (such as hay fever) or, at the severest, to anaphylactic shock (see ANAPHYLAXIS). It is thought that when the normal antigen-antibody defence reaction is followed by tissue damage this may be due to an abnormality in the working of the complement system. See also ALLERGY; IMMUNITY. $\textemdash$hypersensitivity $n$.
