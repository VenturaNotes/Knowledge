- $n$. inflammation of the gall bladder. Acute cholecystitis is a frequent complication of gallstones obstructing the cystic duct (see BILE DUCT) but in a minority of cases can occur in the absence of gallstones (acute acalculous cholecystitis). Initial treatment includes analgesia, intravenous fluid therapy, and broad-spectrum antibiotics. Cholecystectomy is the definitive treatment. Chronic cholecystitis is an outdated term used for recurrent episodes of biliary colic; it should be avoided. See also CHOLESTEROSIS; MURPHY's SIGN.
