- The arithmetic mean of a set of non-negative numbers is never less than their geometric mean. So for any $a, b \ge 0, \frac{a+b}{2} \ge \sqrt{ab}.$ Generally, for a set of numbers $$\{a_i\},\frac 1n \sum a_i \ge \sqrt[n]{\prod a_i}$$with equality if and only if all $a_i$ take the same value. This inequality is often abbreviated to AM-GM.
