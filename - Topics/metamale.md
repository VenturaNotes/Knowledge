- A fruit fly (Drosophila sp.) with three (instead of the normal two) copies of each autosome. The disproportion of autosomes to the normal complement of one X chromosome (plus one Y chromosome, which plays little or no part in sex determination) impairs development, and such flies are typically weak and sterile. Compare METAFEMALE.
