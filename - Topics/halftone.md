## Source [^1]
- A digital process used to create the effect of shading with a wide range of grey values or colors when only two-level pixel values or a much limited range of values is available. By varying the ratio of black to white pixels in each small area of the screen, the eye sees a continuous intensity at normal viewing distance due to the limited resolving power of the eye. (The printing industry uses dots of ink whose size or density varies.)
