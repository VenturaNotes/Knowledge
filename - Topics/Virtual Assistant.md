- A virtual assistant (VA) is a digital program that understands voice commands and natural language to perform tasks for a business.Â It executes tasks that, previously, only humans could complete. VAs use semantic and deep learning technologies, such as personalization, prediction models, deep neural networks (DNNs), and natural language processing. Businesses might invest in a VA to complete tasks typically performed by a human personal assistant, customer assistant, or employee assistant. These tasks might include responding to customer queries, handling financial transactions, and setting up important meetings with clients or potential investors. Other terms for virtual assistant include "digital assistant" and "AI assistant."
