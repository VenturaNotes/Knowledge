- $n$. a compound of fluorine. The incorporation of fluoride ions in the enamel of teeth makes them more resistant to dental caries. The ions enter enamel during its formation, and after tooth eruption by surface absorption, forming hydroxyfluorapatite. The addition of fluoride to public water supplies is called fluoridation. Fluoride may also be applied topically in toothpaste or by a dentist. If the water supply contains too little fluoride, fluoride salts may be given to children in the form of mouthwashes, drops, or tablets.
