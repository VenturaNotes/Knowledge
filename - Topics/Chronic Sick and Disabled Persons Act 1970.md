- (in Britain) an Act providing for the identification and care of those suffering from a chronic or degenerative disease for which there is no cure and which can be only partially alleviated by treatment. Such people are usually distinguished from the elderly who may also suffer from chronic diseases. It is the responsibility of local authorities to identify those with such problems and to ensure that services are available to meet their needs. Identification can be difficult because of the lack of a clear and agreed definition of what constitutes a disability of such severity as to warrant inclusion in such a register.
