- the condition resulting from excess amounts of corticosteroid hormones in the body. Symptoms include weight gain, reddening of the face and neck, excess growth of body and facial hair, raised blood pressure, loss of mineral from the bones (osteoporosis), raised blood glucose levels, and sometimes mental disturbances. The syndrome may be due to overstimulation of the adrenal glands by excessive amounts of the hormone ACTH, secreted either by a tumor of the pituitary gland (Cushing's disease) or by a malignant tumor in the lung or elsewhere. Other causes include a benign or malignant tumor of the adrenal gland(s), resulting in excess activity of the gland, and prolonged therapy with high doses of corticosteroid drugs. \[H. W. Cushing (1869-1939), US surgeon]
