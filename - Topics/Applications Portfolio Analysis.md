- Applications portfolio analysis (APA) is the process of reviewing and assessing the applications used by a business. These applications can be internal, such as those used for HR and accounting, or external, such as those used for eCommerce and customer relations. APA evaluates the business need for each application and its technical and financial feasibility with the goal of identifying which applications should be kept, upgraded, or replaced to improve the overall business efficiency.
