- Acronym for Common Business-Oriented Language. This language is widely used to program computers for business applications, such as invoice and payroll production. It is an easy-to-learn high-level language that uses a limited number of English words. Programs written in COBOL can be run on different computers, provided that the standard version has been used. Because it was designed to make program writing easy, COBOL occupies considerable amounts of computer memory, making it more popular on larger systems than on microcomputers. However, microcomputer versions of COBOL are available.
