- (NYSE) The main US stock exchange. It was founded in 1792 under the Buttonwood Agreement (the name of the tree under which 24 merchants agreed to give each other preference in their dealings); it moved to Wall Street in 1793. The New York Stock & Exchange Board was formally established in 1817; it was renamed the New York Stock Exchange in 1983. In 2006 the NYSE combined with the pan-European exchange Euronext NV to create NYSE Euronext, the world's first global exchange. It acquired the electronic exchange Archipelago Holdings in 2006 and the American Stock Exchange in 2008. The main indexes are the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the NYSE Composite Index, which covers all common stock listed on the exchange.
