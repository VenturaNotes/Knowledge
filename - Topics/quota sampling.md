- A method of non-probability sampling in which the target population is divided into strata (sub-groups) and a quota is set for the number of respondents to be selected from each stratum. According to the requirements of the survey, the strata could be determined by age, gender, social class, ownership of a particular product, etc. The interviewer chooses which persons to interview and allocates them to a quota until each quota is filled. This form of sampling tends to be the most frequently used form in marketing research. See also STRATIFIED SAMPLING.
