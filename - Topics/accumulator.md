- A register that is implicitly specified by one-address format instructions and is used to contain the results of an operation performed by the ALU. It can normally be one of the inputs to the ALU, thus the results of a number of successive operations may be built up—hence the name. In addition to holding results, the accumulator commonly has the ability to perform the various shift and circular shift instructions. It may be part of the processor status word
## Source[^2]
-  An accumulator is a type of register for short-term, intermediate storage of arithmetic and logic data in a computer's central processing unit (CPU).
