- (antilymphocyte globulin, ALS, ALG) an antiserum, containing antibodies that suppress lymphocytic activity, prepared by injecting an animal with lymphocytes. ALS may be given to a patient to prevent the immune reaction that causes tissue rejection following transplantation of such organs as kidneys or of bone marrow. Administration naturally also impairs other immunity mechanisms, making infection a serious hazard.
