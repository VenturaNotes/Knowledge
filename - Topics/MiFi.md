- MiFi is a portable device that allows multiple computerized device users to share a broadband internet connection. The term MiFi is trademarked by its original creator Novatel Wireless, but is often informally used to refer to any device capable of acting as a personal hotspot. MiFi taps into a 3G, 4G, or 5G mobile network to create a broadband hotspot. In order to use Mifi, a mobile device user must purchase a MiFi internet plan from their wireless carrier of choice. Once their MiFi plan is activated, users can connect their mobile device to MiFi to access the internet.
