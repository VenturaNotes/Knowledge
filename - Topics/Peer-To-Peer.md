- Uses [[Socket|sockets]] which are network communication endpoints to establish direct connections between devices on a network 
-  P2P allows devices to act as both clients and servers simultaneously, exchanging data directly with each other.
- Key concepts
	- [[Socket|Sockets]]: 
		- Acts like endpoints for communication
		- Provides applications to send and receive data streams across a network
	- P2P:
		- Every device can initiate communication with any other device
		- Decentralized approach where no central server controls the flow of data
