## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
- Uses [[Socket|sockets]] which are network communication endpoints to establish direct connections between devices on a network 
-  P2P allows devices to act as both clients and servers simultaneously, exchanging data directly with each other.
- Key concepts
	- [[Socket|Sockets]]: 
		- Acts like endpoints for communication
		- Provides applications to send and receive data streams across a network
	- P2P:
		- Every device can initiate communication with any other device
		- Decentralized approach where no central server controls the flow of data
## Source[^2]
- P2P is not considered a [[network topology]] because it describes the relationship between devices in a network where each device acts as both a client and server, sharing resources directly without a [[central server]], rather than defining the physical layout or connection structure of the network (which is what a network topology does)
- P2P can be implemented on various topologies like star or mesh
