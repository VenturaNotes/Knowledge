- The present value of a payment due to be received in the future. If a payment of amount $A$ is due $t$ periods into the future and the proportional interest rate remains constant at $r$ per period, the present discounted value is given by $V=A /(1+r)^{t}=A(1+r)^{-t}$. The present discounted value of a stream of receipts spread over time is the sum of the present discounted values of the various parts of the stream. See also DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW.
