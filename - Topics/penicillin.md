- $n$. an antibiotic that was derived from the mould Penicillium rubrum and first became available for treating bacterial infections in 1941. Since then, a number of naturally occurring penicillins have been developed to treat a wide variety of infections, notably benzylpenicillin (penicillin G) and phenoxymethylpenicillin (penicillin V). There are few serious sideeffects, but some patients are allergic to penicillin and develop such reactions as skin rashes and potentially fatal anaphylaxis. Many antibiotics are derived from the penicillins, including amoxicillin, ampicillin, and ticarcillin; these are known as semisynthetic penicillins. All penicillins except flucloxacillin are beta-lactam antibiotics and are sensitive to penicillinase.
## Source[^2]
- An antibiotic derived from the mould Penicillium notatum; specifically it is known as penicillin $\mathbf{G}$ and belongs to a class of similar substances called penicillins. They are all active against a wide variety of bacteria, producing their effects by inhibiting cross-linking of peptidoglycans in the bacterial cell wall, especially Gram-positive bacteria. Penicillins are used to treat a variety of infections caused by these bacteria, although many bacterial strains have developed resistance.
