- $n$. In psychoanalysis, anything through which an instinct (3) seeks to attain its instinctual aim, including a person, a part object, or either of these in a person's fantasy. It is not necessarily a physical object but rather an object in the sense of a phrase such as object of her desire. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced the distinction between the instinctual aim, the instinctual object, and the instinctual source in his book Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905).
