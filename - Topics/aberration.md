- n. (1) A deviation from what is normal, usual, or right. See also chromosomal aberration.
- (2) A temporary lapse of behavior or mental function. 
- (3) A defect of the crystalline lens of the eye, or of any other lens or mirror, also called astigmatism or dioptric aberration, in which rays of light do not all converge on to a single focal point. In chromatic aberration, different wavelengths of light are refracted through different angles and focused at different distances, leading to blurred images with colored fringes-see also achromatic (2), refraction. In spherical aberration light passing through the lens near its edge is focused at a different point from light passing near the lens's center, resulting in a distorted visual image, the defect arising from the surface of the lens being spherical. \[From Latin aberrare to wander away, from $a b$ away + errare to wander + -ation indicating a process or condition]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. (in optics) a defect in the image formed by an optical device (e.g. a lens). In chromatic aberration the image has coloured fringes as a result of the different extent to which light of different colours is refracted. In spherical aberration, the image is blurred because rays from the object come to a focus in slightly different positions: the rays passing through more peripherally are bent more than those passing through centrally. This occurs even with monochromatic light.
