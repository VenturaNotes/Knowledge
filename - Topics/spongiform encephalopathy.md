- any one of a group of rapidly progressive degenerative neurological diseases that include scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, and kuru, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, and Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome in humans. In humans the spongiform encephalopathies are characterized by rapidly progressive dementia associated with myoclonic jerks (see MYOCLONUS); on pathological examination the brains of affected individuals show a characteristic cystic degeneration. The diseases are thought to be caused by unconventional transmissible agents (see PRION).
