- A situation that may arise when a business or part of a business changes ownership and staff transfer to the new owner. If the change of ownership falls within the scope of the Transfer of Undertakings Protection of Employment Regulations 2006 (TUPE), there is an automatic transfer of an employee's contract of employment. TUPE was first introduced in 1981, as a response to the EC's Acquired Rights Directive, the main objective of which was to safeguard employees' rights in the event of a change of employer. The situations in which a relevant transfer governed by TUPE occurs are numerous, and have been made more so in the latest regulations. The simplest situation is where one company acquires another and staff transfer. More complex situations include contracting out services, the transfer of contracts and franchises, and the transfer of leases. TUPE operates in each of these situations if staff have followed the transfer or have lost employment as a consequence.
