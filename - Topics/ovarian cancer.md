- a malignant tumor of the ovary, usually a carcinoma. Because of its wide-ranging pathology and an imperfect understanding of its causes, ovarian cancer is not readily detected in the early stages of development, when the tumor is small and produces few suspicious symptoms. Increased susceptibility to the disease is associated with raised serum levels of CA125 (see also RISK OF MALIGNANCY INDEX; BRCA1 AND BRCA2). Diagnosis is based on the finding of a solid or cystic mass arising from the pelvis; there may be associated ascites. The incidence of ovarian cancer reaches a peak in postmenopausal women; treatment involves surgery and most cases also require combined chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy.
