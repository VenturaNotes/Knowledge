## Source [^1]
- In the Microsoft Windows and OS/2 operating systems, a library of utility programs stored as separate files with DLL extensions. When needed by a program, they are loaded into memory and executed. DLLs can be shared and their utility programs can be updated without affecting the calling program. Although extra time is spent in disk input/output, disk caching and faster disk subsystems make this a valuable technique. See also OVERLAY.
