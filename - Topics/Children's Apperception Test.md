A version of the TAT designed specifically for children, consisting of 10 pictures in which animals take the place of human beings in all cases on the assumption that children are likely to empathize more easily with animal figures. The test was constructed by the Austrian-born US psychoanalyst Leopold Bellak (1916-2000) and Sonia Sorel Bellak (born 1918) and published in 1949; Leopold Bellak described it in his book The Thematic Apperception Test and the Children's Apperception Test in Clinical Use (1954).
