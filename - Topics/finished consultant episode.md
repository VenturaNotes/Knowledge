- (FCE) the time a patient spends in the care of one consultant in one health-care provider. If a patient is transferred to a different hospital provider or a different consultant within the same hospital, a new FCE begins. In hospital episode statistics an FCE is commonly referred to as simply an 'episode'. A spell may consist of several episodes. See also CONTINUOUS PATIENT PATHWAY.
