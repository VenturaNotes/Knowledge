- (PIBS) Securities issued by building societies that have no maturity date. PIBS usually have a fixed interest rate and cannot be sold back to the issuing society, although a particular issue of PIBS can be called, or redeemed, on a specified date. PIBS can count towards the capital for capital adequacy calculations. The need for PIBS arises because mutual institutions do not have the option of raising funds on the stock market.
