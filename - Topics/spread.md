- (1) The difference between the buying and selling price made by a market maker on the stock exchange. 
- (2) The diversity of the investments in a portfolio. The greater the spread of a portfolio the less volatile it will be. 
- (3) The simultaneous purchase and sale of commodity futures (see FUTURES CONTRACT) in the hope that movement in their relative prices will enable a profit to be made. This may include a purchase and sale of the same commodity for the same delivery, but on different commodity exchanges (see STRADDLE), or a purchase and sale of the same commodity for different deliveries.

- The difference between the bid and offer prices quoted by a market-maker. The prices of securities at which market-makers are willing to sell are higher than those at which they are willing to buy. The spread has to cover the market-makers' operating costs and provide profits, and includes a premium against the risk that any particular customer has insider knowledge about the security being traded. Spreads tend to be smaller on more widely traded securities.
