- (1) The difference between the buying and selling price made by a market maker on the stock exchange. 
- (2) The diversity of the investments in a portfolio. The greater the spread of a portfolio the less volatile it will be. 
- (3) The simultaneous purchase and sale of commodity futures (see FUTURES CONTRACT) in the hope that movement in their relative prices will enable a profit to be made. This may include a purchase and sale of the same commodity for the same delivery, but on different commodity exchanges (see STRADDLE), or a purchase and sale of the same commodity for different deliveries.
