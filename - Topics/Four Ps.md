- The Four P’s—typically referred to as the Four P’s of Marketing—are the four key aspects of a successful marketing plan: product, price, plan, and promotion. By prioritizing these four marketing factors, businesses increase the chance that their marketing attempts will entice customers to buy their product and service offerings.
- The Four P’s state that the product or service for sale must satisfy customer wants and needs. These principles also assert that the price an item is sold at should be within a price range that the customer expects, neither too high nor too low. When promoting products and services, companies must inform the public about how their offerings work and how they benefit customers.
- Lastly, the location in which the product can be purchased should be clearly stated, to ensure that customers know how and where they can purchase the product or service offering.
