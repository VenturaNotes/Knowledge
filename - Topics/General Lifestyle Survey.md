- (GLF) A UK sample survey, formerly known as the General Household Survey, used to obtain information on the labor force and on household expenditure. The survey has been conducted continuously since 1971, except for breaks in 1997-8 and 1999-2000, when it was redeveloped. From 2000 to 2011 the GLF comprised two components: the continuous survey and additional modules, or trailers. Given the need to harmonize UK and EU poverty indicators, the Office for National Statistics has replaced the GLF from January 2012 with a new survey based on the Opinions Survey, whereas the GLF questions for statistics on income and living conditions required by European law have migrated to the Family Resources Survey.
