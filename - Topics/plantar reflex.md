- a reflex obtained by drawing a bluntly pointed object (such as a key) along the outer border of the sole of the foot from the heel to the little toe. The normal flexor response is a bunching and downward movement of the toes. An upward movement of the big toe is called an extensor response (or Babinski reflex or response). In all persons over the age of 18 months this is a sensitive indication of damage to the pyramidal system in either the brain or spinal cord.
