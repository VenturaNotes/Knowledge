- An increase in the salt content of the soil (or of a body of fresh water), which can lead to the retardation of plant growth and eventually renders the soil infertile. This problem is particularly acute in hot areas, where water readily evaporates from the soil, and it may also occur as a consequence of irrigation. Salts dissolved in irrigation water build up in the soil as the water evaporates, making the water potential of the soil water more negative. This reduces the gradient of water potential between the soil water and the roots, reducing the rate of water uptake by the roots.
