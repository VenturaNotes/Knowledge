Created by Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 1996-98, its success was based in its algorithms' ability to return search results that were reliably relevant to users' needs$\textemdash$a considerable advance over other search engines at that time. In 2007 over $50 \%$ of all web searches were performed on Google, and the verb 'to Google', meaning 'to perform a web search', has entered the English language. The commercial success of the search engine allowed Google, Inc., to diversify into other software areas and has made it a major force in the global computer industry.
