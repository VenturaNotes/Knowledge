- A price reduction available only to purchasers of at least some minimum quantity. Such reductions may be publicly advertised, or available by negotiation. Quantity discounts may be due to lower costs made possible by economies of scale in supplying larger orders, to the monopsonistic advantage possessed by large-scale buyers, or to seconddegree price discrimination.
