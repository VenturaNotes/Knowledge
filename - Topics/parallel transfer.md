- Transmission of multiple units of information concurrently. For example, if two computers connected by eight wires wish to communicate an 8 bit unit of information, the sending computer would present all eight bits at the same time, one bit per wire. The receiving computer would accept the bits from the wires, and recreate the 8 bit unit. Compare SERIAL TRANSFER.
