- (1) The amount of graphical information that can be shown on a visual display. The resolution of a display device is usually denoted by the number of lines that can be distinguished visually per inch.
- Resolution is often confused with [[addressability]]. The addressability of a computer-graphics system is defined by the number of displayable lines, or alternatively by the number of points or pixels (picture elements) that can be displayed in the vertical and horizontal directions. Computer graphics systems are now capable of addressing many thousand pixels horizontally and vertically but the resolution is likely to be nearer 400 lines per inch.

- (3) A rule of inference in mathematical logic, used to deduce a new logical formula from two old ones. It has been used extensively in the automatic derivation of mathematical theorems since it is an efficient alternative to traditional rules of inference. See also UNIFICATION.

- A binding decision made by the members of a company. If a motion is put before the members of a company at a general meeting and the required majority vote in favor of it, the motion is passed and becomes a resolution. A resolution may also be passed by unanimous informal consent of the members.
- UK company law recognizes several different types of resolution, each of which has different requirements in terms of the required voting majority. The type of resolution required to make a particular decision may be prescribed by the Companies Act or by the company's articles. For example, an ordinary resolution is required to remove a director and a special resolution is required to change the company's articles of association. See also WRITTEN RESOLUTION.

- (1) the stage during which inflammation gradually disappears. 
- (2) the degree to which individual details can be distinguished by the eye, as through a microscope.

- The process of separating a racemic mixture into its optically active constituents. In some cases the crystals of the two forms have a different appearance, and the separation can be done by hand. In general, however, physical methods (distillation, crystallization, etc.) cannot be used because the optical isomers have identical physical properties. The most common technique is to react the mixture with a compound that is itself optically active, and then separate the two. For instance, a racemic mixture of $l$-A and $d$-A reacted with $l$-B, gives two compounds AB that are not optical isomers but diastereoisomers and can be separated and reconverted into the pure $l$-A and $d$-A. Biological techniques using bacteria that convert one form but not the other can also be used.
