- (1) The amount of graphical information that can be shown on a visual display. The resolution of a display device is usually denoted by the number of lines that can be distinguished visually per inch.
- Resolution is often confused with [[addressability]]. The addressability of a computer-graphics system is defined by the number of displayable lines, or alternatively by the number of points or pixels (picture elements) that can be displayed in the vertical and horizontal directions. Computer graphics systems are now capable of addressing many thousand pixels horizontally and vertically but the resolution is likely to be nearer 400 lines per inch.

- (3) A rule of inference in mathematical logic, used to deduce a new logical formula from two old ones. It has been used extensively in the automatic derivation of mathematical theorems since it is an efficient alternative to traditional rules of inference. See also UNIFICATION.

The type of resolution required to make a particular decision may be prescribed by the Companies Act or by the company's articles. For example, an ordinary resolution is required to remove a director and a special resolution is required to change the company's articles of association. See also WRITTEN RESOLUTION.
