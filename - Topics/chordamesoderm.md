- Tissue found in the midline of the early chordate embryo that forms the notochord. Derived from dorsal mesoderm, it acts as an organizer, producing chemical signals that cause the overlying ectoderm (neural plate) to differentiate into the neural tube$\textemdash$the precursor of the brain and spinal cord. In vertebrates the notochord is subsequently replaced by the vertebral column.
