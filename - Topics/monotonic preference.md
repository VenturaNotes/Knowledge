## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- When a consumer prefers a bundle of goods that has more of at least one good and no less of any other good. In other words, more is always better
- For example, if a consumer has bundles A (3, 5) and B (3, 2), they will prefer bundle A because it has more units of good 2. 
- There are two types of monotonic preferences
	- [[Weakly monotonic]]
	- [[Strictly monotonic]]

## Source[^2]
- Monotonic preferences mean that the customer always prefers more of a good
- This comes in two flavors
	- Strictly monotonic: More of one good is always preferred to less of that good
	- Weakly monotonic: More of one good is always equivalent or better than less of that good.
