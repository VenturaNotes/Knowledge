- A collection of networked processors providing large-scale computing services. These typically consist of thousands of relatively cheap processors collected together in racks and connected with cabling. Their usual applications include web search engines, cloud computing, and supercomputing. The main performance issues have to do with cooling, power consumption, and reliability, rather than with the speed of the individual processor units.
