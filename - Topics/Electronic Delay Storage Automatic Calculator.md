- A machine designed in 1946 by M. V. Wilkes of Cambridge University, UK, inspired by the stored-program concept being taught in the US by von Neumann and others. The design was notable for using acoustic delay lines for memory. EDSAC began operations in May 1949, becoming the first complete operational stored-program computer. See also Manchester Mark I.
