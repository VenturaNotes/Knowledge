- $n$. a simple protein that combines with a nucleic acid to form a nucleoprotein.
## Source[^2]
- Any of a group of water-soluble proteins found in association with the DNA of plant and animal chromosomes to form chromatin. They contain a large proportion of the basic (positively charged) amino acids lysine, arginine, and histidine, and hence bind tightly to the negatively charged DNA. There are five classes of histones$\textemdash$H1, H2A, H2B, H3, and H4$\textemdash$involved in the condensation and coiling of chromosomes. The DNA winds around clusters of histones forming the spool-like nucleosomes, the basic units of DNA packaging. Each nucleosome comprises a pair of histones from each of classes H2A to H4 plus a single H1 histone. Chemical modification of histones is a key aspect of suppressing or activating gene activity (see CHROMATIN REMODELLING). Histones do not occur in vertebrate sperm cells (see PROTAMINE) or in bacteria, although a very similar protein has been found in the genome of the archaean Thermoplasma. See also EPIGENOME; GENE IMPRINTING.
