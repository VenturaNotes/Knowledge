- $n$. a state of mind characterized by excessive cheerfulness and increased activity. The mood is euphoric and can change rapidly to irritability. Thought and speech are pressured and rapid to the point of incoherence and the connections between ideas may be impossible to follow to the point of loosening of associations. Behavior is overactive, extravagant, overbearing, and sometimes aggressive. Excessive drug and alcohol use can complicate the picture. Judgment is impaired, with disinhibited behavior, and therefore the patient may damage his or her own interests. There may be grandiose delusions. Mixed affective states (such as low mood with pressured speech and irritability) are common. Treatment is usually with medication, such as lithium, benzodiazepines, or antipsychotics, and hospital admission is frequently necessary. See also BIPOLAR AFFECTIVE DISORDER. â€”manic adj.
