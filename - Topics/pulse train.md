- A repetitive series of pulses, separated in time by a fixed and often constant interval. The duration of each pulse and its amplitude are also often made constant. This type of waveform may be defined by its mark-space ratio, i.e. the ratio of pulse duration, $t_1$, to pulse separation, $t_2$, and by its pulse repetition frequency, which is given by $$1/(t_1+t_2)$$
