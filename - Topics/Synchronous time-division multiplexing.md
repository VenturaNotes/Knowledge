- The multiplexer assigns every device an equal time slot at all times, whether or not the device has any data to send. The device has to transmit the data during the assigned time slot. If it doesn't have any data to send, its time slot remains null. Another device can't use this time slot. 
	- #question If the time slot remains null, does this means there is zero time for this slot or the value is just null?
