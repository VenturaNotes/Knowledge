- (iff) Equivalence between two statements. 'If $A$ then $B$ ' means $A$ is a sufficient condition for $B$ and $B$ is a necessary condition for $A$. 'If $B$ then $A$ ' means $B$ is a sufficient condition for $A$ and $A$ is a necessary condition for $B$. Both statements being true implies ' $A$ if and only if $B$ ' (written ' $A$ iff $B$ ') which means that each of $A$ and $B$ is a necessary and sufficient condition for the other; either both are true or both are false. The two statements are thus equivalent.
