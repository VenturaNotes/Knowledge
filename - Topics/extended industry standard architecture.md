- A bus structure for microcomputers with Intel 32-bit microprocessors, based on and compatible with that used by IBM in their AT series ISA (see Industry Standard Architecture). EISA was developed by manufacturers other than IBM as an alternative to IBM's MCA (micro channel architecture), which is not compatible with earlier systems. It has been superseded by PCI and PCI Express.
