- (1) (in microbiology) The degree to which pathogenic microorganisms remain unaffected by antibiotics and other drugs. Resistance to antibiotics is a growing and serious problem in human and veterinary medicine, to the extent that some strains of pathogen are now susceptible to very few drugs. Genes for antibiotic resistance are often carried on plasmids or transposons, which can spread across species barriers. 
- (2) (in ecology) 
	- (a) The degree to which a pest can withstand the effects of a pesticide. It depends on the selection and spread within a pest population of genes that confer the ability to destroy, or minimize the effects of, a pesticide. 
	- (b) See ENVIRONMENTAL RESISTANCE. 
- (3) (in immunology) The degree of immunity to infection that an animal possesses.
