- German mathematician who made various contributions to mathematics but is perhaps now best remembered for his work in abstract algebra. In 1847, Gabriel Lam√© claimed to have proven Fermat's Last Theorem, but his proof failed, as he incorrectly assumed subrings of the complex numbers to be unique factorization domains. Kummer rectified this, introducing 'ideal numbers' (precursors to ideals in rings), and was able to prove Fermat's Last Theorem for all exponents which were 'regular' primes. In particular, this proved the theorem for all powers up to 100 except 37, 59, and 67.
