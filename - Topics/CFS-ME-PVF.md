- a condition, known variously as chronic fatigue syndrome, myalgic encephalomyelitis (or encephalopathy), or postviral fatigue syndrome, characterized by extreme disabling fatigue that has lasted for at least six months, is made worse by physical or mental exertion, does not resolve with bed rest, and cannot be attributed to other disorders. The fatigue is accompanied by at least some of the following: muscle pain or weakness (fibromyalgia), poor coordination, joint pain, recurrent sore throat, slight fever, painful lymph nodes in the neck and armpits, depression, cognitive impairment (especially an inability to concentrate), and general malaise. The cause is unknown, but in some cases some viral conditions (especially glandular fever) are thought to trigger the disease; however, no viral aetiology has yet been identified. Treatment is restricted to relieving the symptoms and helping sufferers to plan their lives with a minimum of energy expenditure. Graded physiotherapy may be helpful in some cases. Many psychiatrists consider CFS/ME/PVF to be a mood disorder and use behavioral and cognitive techniques as well as antidepressants to treat it.
