- Express consent means explicitly giving permission for something to happen. Typically, express consent comes in the form of a verbal or written statement. Customers often give express consent for corporations to send them marketing communications by providing some form of written consent, such as filling out an "opt-in" form. These forms give companies permission to send a customer marketing texts, emails, or push notifications. According to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), corporations must request express consent from customers in order to send marketing communications to their phone or email. Defying the GDPR can cost a business thousands of dollars in non-compliance fees.
