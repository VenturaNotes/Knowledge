- Tactic knowledge is the wisdom that someone has gained through their career. It can sometimes refer to hard facts or knowledge about an industry or technical processes. It can also apply to social skills. An employee with tactic knowledge doesn't need to be re-taught information. It doesn't mean that there isn't room for improvement or further training but refers to an individual's current skillset.
