- a rare episodic disorder characterized by periods (usually of a few days or weeks), in which sufferers eat enormously, sleep for most of the day and night, and may become more dependent or aggressive than normal. Between episodes they are usually quite unaffected. The disorder almost always resolves spontaneously. \[W. Kleine (20th century), German neuropsychiatrist; M. Levin (20th century), US neurologist]
