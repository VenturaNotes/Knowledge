- the geographic area from which a hospital can expect to receive patients and on which (in Britain) the designated population of the hospital is based. There is no statutory requirement for patients to use the hospital(s) of their area, but a code of zoning practice exists for some specialties (e.g. mental illness). A hospital may have a smaller catchment area for common specialties than for rarer ones, which may be shared between several districts (regional specialty) or regions (supraregional specialty).
