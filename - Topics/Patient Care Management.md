- Patient care management (PCM ) is a system of services to help patients take care of their health. It aims to decrease a patient’s need for medical care. Providers enroll patients to receive interventions throughout their health and illness. PCM covers many aspects of a person’s health, including wellness exams, routine screenings, and short-term or long-term management of chronic conditions.
