- $n$. Suppression by a neuron of the response of a neighboring neuron at the same level in a sensory system, such as the suppression by neurons receiving information from the OFF region of a center-surround receptive field of neurons in the ON region if both regions are stimulated simultaneously. This phenomenon occurs in certain neural structures in which receptor cells are arranged to represent points along a continuum, as in the retina and the organ of Corti, and in which excitation at one point produces inhibition at adjacent points, leading to enhancement or sharpening of differences between neighboring regions.
