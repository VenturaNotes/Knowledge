- A ratio that measures the number of dependents in the population relative to the number of economically active. A higher ratio indicates greater reliance of the non-working population on goods and services produced by the working population in the society. Let $N_{o}$ be the size of the population aged over $65, N_{y}$ the population aged below 15 , and $N_{a}$ the economically active population aged 15-64. The old-age-dependency ratio is $N_{o} / N_{a}$, the young-age-dependency ratio is $N_{y} / N_{a}$, and the total dependency ratio is $\left(N_{y}+N_{o}\right) / N_{a}$. The old-age-dependency ratio is increasing in many countries and is an important factor in the pensions crisis.
