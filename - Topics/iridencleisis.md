- $n$. an operation for glaucoma, now rarely performed, in which a small incision is made beneath the conjunctiva close to the cornea and part of the iris is drawn into it. The iris acts like a wick and keeps the incision open for the drainage of fluid from the anterior chamber of the eye to the tissue beneath the conjunctiva.
