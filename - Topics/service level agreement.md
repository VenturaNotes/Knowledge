- An agreement between the supplier of a service and the users of that service that sets out the levels of service that will be offered, preferably in quantitative terms, and the obligations on the user of the service. A typical agreement for a computing service or network service will set out the expected levels of service measured in terms of one or more of the following: availability, fault reporting, recovery from breakdowns, traffic levels, throughput, response times, training and advisory services, and similar measures of the service quality as seen by the end-user. The agreement will also set out user costs and charges, the provision of access to premises for service contractors, and standards of training to be achieved by users. The agreement may form part of a legal contract, yet is equally likely to be found within a single large organization where one unit within the organization offers services to other units, but where a legally enforceable contract would not be appropriate.
