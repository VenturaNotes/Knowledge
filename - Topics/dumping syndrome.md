- a syndrome that may occur following operations on the stomach, particularly gastrectomy (postgastrectomy syndrome), due to the precipitous transit of ingested food into the small intestine. In early dumping, debilitating symptoms start within 30 minutes of the meal; they include abdominal cramps, flushing, sweating, diarrhoea, and palpitations. Late dumping syndrome occurs 1-2 hours after a meal and relates to hypoglycaemia. The patient may feel faint, weak, and nauseous, has a rapid pulse, and may sweat and become pale. Avoidance of large carbohydrate meals and having small but frequent meals (six a day) may relieve the symptoms but further surgery is sometimes required.
