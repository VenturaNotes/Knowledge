- (1) The rate of interest used by commercial banks as a basis for charging for loans. Most borrowers pay a premium over base rate, whose size depends on how risky loans to them are considered to be, and what collateral they can provide.
- (2) An informal term for the rate at which the Bank of England lends to discount houses (this corresponds to the minimum lending rate that was abolished in 1981). The rate at which the Bank of England lends governs interest rates elsewhere in the banking system.

- (1) The rate of interest used as a basis by banks for the rates they charge their customers. In practice most customers will pay a premium over base rate on loans and will receive below the base rate on deposits with banks. 
- (2) An informal name for the rate at which a country's central bank lends to the banking system, which effectively controls the lending rate throughout the banking system. In the UK, suspension of the official minimum lending rate in 1981 heralded a loosening of government control over the banking system, but the need to increase interest rates in the late 1980s (to control inflation and the balance of payments deficit) led to the use of a base rate. In 1997 sole responsibility for setting the base rate was given to the Bank of England. The base rate is more formally known as the bank rate.
