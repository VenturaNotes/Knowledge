- (contusion) $n$. an area of skin discoloration caused by the escape of blood from ruptured underlying vessels following injury. Initially red or pink, a bruise gradually becomes bluish, and then greenish yellow, as the haemoglobin in the tissues breaks down chemically and is absorbed. It may be necessary to draw off blood from very severe bruises through a needle, to aid healing. A bruise may be the sign of previous assault, detected on clinical examination or at autopsy. In a child it may be the only (and vital) evidence of child abuse. See also BURN.
