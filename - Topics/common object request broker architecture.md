## Source[^2]
- CORBA (Common Object Request Broker Architecture) is a technology that allows software applications to communicate with each other. It does this by providing a standard way for different programs to send and receive messages. This makes it possible for businesses to build systems that can interact with one another regardless of the programming languages they were written in or the operating system they're running on.
