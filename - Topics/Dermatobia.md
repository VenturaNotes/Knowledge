- $n$. a genus of nonbloodsucking flies inhabiting lowland woods and forests of South and Central America. The parasitic maggots of D. hominis can cause a serious disease of the skin in humans (see MYIASIS). The maggots burrow into the skin, after emerging from eggs transported by bloodsucking insects (e.g. mosquitoes), and produce painful boil-like swellings. Treatment involves surgical removal of the maggots.
