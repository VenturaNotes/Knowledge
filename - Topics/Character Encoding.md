- A mapping of a coded character set onto a character representation for manipulation in a computer. A single character set may have more than one character encoding. Many character encodings, such as the ISO 8859 series, assign a single byte to each character. Other character encodings, such as the Unicode UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 encoding forms, define a number of ways of encoding the same character.
