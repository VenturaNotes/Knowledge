- If $X$ is a random variable with pdf given by $$f(x) = \frac{\lambda^v x^{v-1} e^{-\lambda x}}{\Gamma(v)}$$where $\Gamma$ is a gamma function and $\lambda, v, x$ are all positive, then we say that $X$ has a gamma distribution with parameters $\lambda, v$. When $v=1$, $f(x)$ reduces to $\lambda e^{-\lambda x}$ which is the exponential distribution.
