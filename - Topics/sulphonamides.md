- Organic compounds containing the group $-\mathrm{SO}_{2}. \mathrm{NH}_{2}$. The sulphonamides are amides of sulphonic acids. Many have antibacterial action and are also known as sulpha drugs, including sulfadiazine, $\mathrm{NH}_{2} \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{4} \mathrm{SO}_{2} \mathrm{NHC}_{4} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{~N}_{2}$, sulfathiazole, $\mathrm{NH}_{2} \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{4} \mathrm{SO}_{2} \mathrm{NHC}_{5} \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{NS}$, and several others. They act by preventing bacteria from reproducing and are used to treat a variety of bacterial infections, especially of the gut and urinary system.
