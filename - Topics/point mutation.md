## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A change in the base sequence of DNA involving a single nucleotide, whether by insertion, substitution, deletion, or inversion. Point mutations in coding regions of the genome will be transcribed into the corresponding messenger RNA. This can result in a misreading of the genetic code during the translation phase of protein synthesis and can change the order of amino acids making up a protein, which may or may not affect the function of that protein. See also intergenic SUPPRESSOR; MISSENSE MUTATION. Compare CHROMOSOME MUTATION; SINGLE NUCLEOTIDE POLYMORPHISM.
