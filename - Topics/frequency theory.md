- $n$. A theory of pitch perception first proposed in 1886 by the British physiologist William Rutherford (1839-99) according to which the ear converts acoustic vibrations into nerve impulses by emitting one impulse for each cycle of the sound wave in the manner of a telephone. This mechanism is believed to operate for low-frequency sounds, but because an auditory neuron can respond up to only about 500 hertz, this theory cannot explain the perception of higher-pitched sounds within the audibility range. Also called the telephone theory. Compare Place THEORY, VOLLEY THEORY.
