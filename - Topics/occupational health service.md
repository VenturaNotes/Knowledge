- (OHS) a scheme by which employers provide a mainly preventive health service for employees. Specially trained doctors and nurses advise management on hazardous situations at work. Advice is also given to management to ensure that people with ill health or disability are not prevented from taking up employment and on the potential for rehabilitating employees with prolonged or repeated sickness absence. Instruction may be given to the workforce on simple first aid procedures, and health promotion programmes may be offered in relation to nutrition, physical activity, and stress. With the approval of the Health and Safety Executive, the OHS may conduct routine tests on employees working with potentially hazardous substances, such as lead. See also COSHH.
