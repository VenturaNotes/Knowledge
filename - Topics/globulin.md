- $n$. one of a group of simple proteins that are soluble in dilute salt solutions and can be coagulated by heat. A range of different globulins is present in the blood (the serum globulins, including alpha $(\alpha)$, beta $(\beta)$, and gamma $(\gamma)$ globulins). Some globulins have important functions as antibodies (see IMMUNOGLOBULIN); others are responsible for the transport of lipids, iron, or copper in the blood. See also HORMONE-BINDING GLOBULINS.
## Source[^2]
- Any of a group of globular proteins that are generally insoluble in water and present in blood, eggs, milk, and as a reserve protein in seeds. Blood serum globulins comprise four types: $\alpha_{1^{-}}, \alpha_{2^{-}}$, and $\beta$-globulins, which serve as carrier proteins; and $\gamma$-globulins (gamma globulins), which include the immunoglobulins responsible for immune responses.
