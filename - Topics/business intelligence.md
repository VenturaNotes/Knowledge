- Any software system that enables firms to collect and analyze large quantities of raw data and to use these findings to inform their business decisions. The term was first used in 1958 by an IBM computer scientist, Hans Peter Luhn. Modern BI systems are used principally to measure, analyze, and report detailed information about a company's own operations, thereby shedding light on its various activities and overall performance. They combine data warehousing and knowledge management functions.
