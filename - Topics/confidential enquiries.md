- special enquiries that seek to improve health and health care by collecting evidence on aspects of care and disseminating recommendations based on these findings. MBRRACE-UK (Mothers and Babies; Reducing Risks through Audits and Confidential Enquiries in the UK) investigates maternal deaths, stillbirths, late fetal losses and terminations, and neonatal deaths (see INFANT MORTALITY RATE; MATERNAL DEATH; MATERNAL MORTALITY RATE; PERINATAL MORTALITY RATE). It replaced the Centre for Maternal and Child Enquiries (CMACE), which carried out this work until 2012. The National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death investigates general medical and surgical care, and the National Confidential Inquiry into Suicide and Homicide by People with Mental Illness covers the care of people with mental illness. NHS England manages the contracts with the confidential enquiries.
