- The extent to which a market is dominated by a limited number of firms. The most common ways of measuring concentration are the $N$-firm concentration ratio and the Herfindahl index. See also EXPORT CONCENTRATION.
## Source[^2]
- The degree to which an industry is dominated by a small group of firms and thus closed to competitive pressure. According to a standard industry structure analysis, this will be the major factor determining the nature of the market and the strategies necessary for succeeding within it. See also FOUR-FIRM CONCENTRATION RATIO; HERFINDAHL INDEX; STRUCTURE-CONDUCT-PERFORMANCE MODEL.
## Source[^3]
- The quantity of dissolved substance per unit quantity of solvent in a solution. Concentration is measured in various ways. The amount of substance dissolved per unit volume (symbol $c$) has units of $\mathrm{mol}~ \mathrm{dm}^{-3}$ or $\mathrm{mol} ~\mathrm{l}^{-1}$. It is now called 'concentration' (formerly molarity). Osmolarity is the concentration of osmotically active particles expressed as osmoles per litre of solution. The mass concentration (symbol $\pi$) is the mass of solute per unit volume of solvent. It has units of $\mathrm{kg}~ \mathrm{dm}^{-3}, \mathrm{~g} \mathrm{~cm}^{-3}$, etc. The molal concentration (or molality; symbol $m$ ) is the amount of substance per unit mass of solvent, commonly given in units of $\mathrm{mol}~ \mathrm{kg}^{-1}$. Osmolality is the concentration of osmotically active particles expressed as osmoles per kilogram of solvent.
