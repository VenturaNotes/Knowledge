- Algebraic structures are sets of elements equipped with one or more operations that satisfy certain properties or axioms. 
	- #question Are all algebraic structures in terms of sets?

### Groups:
- A group is a set of elements along with a single operation that satisfies four properties: [[closure]], [[associativity]], [[identity]], and [[invertibility]]
	- Example: The set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition
		- Closure: The sum of any two integers is an integer
		- Associativity: $(a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$
		- Identity: 0 is the identity element (since $a + 0 = a$)
		- Invertibility: Each integer has an [[additive inverse]] (e.g., the inverse of 3 is -3)

### Abelian Groups (Commutative Groups):
- An [[Commutative group|Abelian group]] (or commutative group) is a group where the operation is commutative, meaning that the order of the operation does not matter.
	- Example: The set of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$ under addition
		- Closure, associativity, identity, and invertibility hold, and $a + b = b + a$ (commutativity)

### Rings
- A [[ring]] is an algebraic structure consisting of a set with two operations (typically addition and multiplication) that satisfy certain properties
	- Example: The set of integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition and multiplication
		- Closure under both operations
		- Additions forms an [[Commutative group|Abelian group]] and multiplication is [[associative]]
		- [[Distributive property]] of multiplication over addition holds 
		- However, rings may or may not have a [[multiplicative identity]] and may not have have [[Multiplicative Inverse|multiplicative inverses]] (if they do, they are called [[fields]])

### Fields
- A [[fields|field]] is a ring in which every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, and multiplication is commutative
	- Example: The set of rational numbers $\mathbb{Q}$, real numbers $\mathbb{R}$, or complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ under addition and multiplication.
		- All field axioms are satisfied, including closure, associativity, commutativity, distributivity, and the existence of inverses for both addition and multiplication
			- #question what does it mean by all field axioms are "satisfied"?

### Vector Spaces
- A [[vector space]] (or linear space) is a set of vectors that can be added together and multiplied by scalars (elements from a field), satisfying several axioms
	- #question what is meant by "elements from a field" here?
	- Example: The set of all 2-dimensional vectors $\mathbb{R}^2$ with the usual vector addition and scalar multiplication
		- Properties include closure under addition and scalar multiplication, associativity, commutativity, and distributivity

### Monoids
- A [[monoid]] is a set with a single operation that is associative and has an identity element
	- Example: The set of non-negative integers $\mathbb{Z}_{\ge 0}$ under addition.
		- Closure and associativity hold, and there is an identity element (0) for addition
