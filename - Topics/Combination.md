### Definition
- Order not important
- Formula
	- $_nC_r = \frac {n!}{(n-r)!r!}$

### Examples
- Given CAT, how many combinations of 2 letters can you make?
	- $_3C_2 = 3$ 
		- CA, CT, TA
## Source[^2]
- If you're asked something like "how many different type of nut mixtures can you make from 4 types of nuts" given S = {P, H, A, C}
	- We can see that 15 combinations are possible with the formula $C_T = 2^n-1$ 

## Source[^3]
- (1) A subset of a finite set of elements. The number of combinations of $n$ distinct objects taken k at a time is $$^nC_k = \frac{n!}{[k!(n-k)!]}$$
- (2) A method of combining functions in a parallel manner (compare COMPOSITION). For functions f and g, $$f: S \to T \text{ and } g: U \to V$$the combination $f \times g$ is such that $$f \times g: S \times U \to T \times V$$where $S \times U$ and $T \times V$ are Cartesian products, and $$(f \times g)(s, u) = (f(s),g(u))$$(see ORDERED PAIR)
