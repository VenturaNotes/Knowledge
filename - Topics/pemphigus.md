- (pemphigus vulgaris) $n$. a rare but serious type of autoimmune disease marked by successive outbreaks of blisters. The blisters are superficial and do not remain intact for long; the mouth and other mucous membranes, as well as the skin, are usually affected. Oral pemphigus often precedes skin lesions; it is more prevalent in women and without treatment is potentially fatal. A number of milder variants of the disease exist. Systemic immunosuppressant treatment is required.
