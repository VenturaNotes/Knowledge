- A bond issued in a eurocurrency. The eurobond market is now one of the largest markets for raising money (it is much larger than the UK stock exchange). Initially the main reason for this popularity was that Eurobonds were bearer securities; this meant that secondary market investors could remain anonymous, usually for the purpose of avoiding tax. Although there is still no central register for eurobonds, the use of electronic clearing systems means that anonymity is no longer a practical possibility.
