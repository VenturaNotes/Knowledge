- A bond issued in a eurocurrency. The eurobond market is now one of the largest markets for raising money (it is much larger than the UK stock exchange). Initially the main reason for this popularity was that Eurobonds were bearer securities; this meant that secondary market investors could remain anonymous, usually for the purpose of avoiding tax. Although there is still no central register for eurobonds, the use of electronic clearing systems means that anonymity is no longer a practical possibility.

- A bond issued in a eurocurrency, that is, a European currency held outside its country of origin. Eurobonds are issued in bearer form, and the interest payments are free of withholding taxes. They are thus attractive to investors wishing to remain anonymous, for tax avoidance or other reasons. They may be of various maturities, and at fixed interest rates, or floating rates linked to the London Inter Bank Offered Rate.
