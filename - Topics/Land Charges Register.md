- (1) The register of land charges on unregistered land, kept at the Land Registry. Charges are registered against the name of the estate owner. The kinds of charges that must be registered are set out in the Land Charges Act 1972 and include estate contracts, equitable easements, restrictive covenants, and HM Revenue charges. Registration constitutes actual notice to any person of the existence of the charge. If a charge is not registered it will not bind a purchaser for money or money's worth of a legal estate in the land, even if he had notice of the charge. Some charges, if not registered, will not bind the purchaser for value of any interest (whether legal or equitable) in the land. 
- (2) (Local Land Charges Register) A register kept by each London borough, the City of London, and each unitary authority or district council. Public authorities may register statutory restrictions on land, e.g. under town and country planning legislation. These are registered against the land itself, not the estate owner. If restrictions are not registered, the purchaser is still bound by them, but will be entitled to compensation.
