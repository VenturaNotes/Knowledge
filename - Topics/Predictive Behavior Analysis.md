- Predictive behavior analytics is the practice of applying statistical and mathematical techniques to data to find patterns or trends in that data. These techniques include data mining, algorithm clustering, and neural networking. Predictive behavior analytics can forecast customer behavior based on historical trends. For example, analytics can predict when a customer will make a purchase from an online store or which customer segments are the most likely to purchase a particular product.
