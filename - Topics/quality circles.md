- A technique that brings together members of a workforce to solve problems and to put forward ideas for improving a process or product. It aims to develop employee participation and process ownership at the same time as exploiting employees' creativity and expertise. Participation is voluntary, employees are paid for participating in such groups, and training is given in analytical and problem-solving techniques. Success is frequently related to whether or not senior management appears to take the recommendations of the groups seriously.
