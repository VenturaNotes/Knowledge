- A phylum of seed plants (see gymnosperm) that contains many extinct species; the few modern representatives of the group include Cycas and Zamia. Cycads inhabit tropical and subtropical regions, sometimes growing to a height of 20 m . The stem bears a crown of fernlike leaves. These species are among the most primitive of living seed plants.
