- A contingency theory of leadership holding that leaders should vary the extent to which they allow followers to participate in decision making according to certain key factors in the situation. These include the nature of the task, the extent to which followers can be expected to disagree over the best solution, and the extent to which followers will accept decisions they personally disagree with. A decision tree is used to assess these factors and to decide which of a range of leadership styles is most appropriate.
