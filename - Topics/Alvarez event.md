- The collision of a giant meteorite with the earth 66 million years ago that caused catastrophic changes to the earth's climate and environment and a mass extinction of species, including the dinosaurs. This hypothesis was advanced in 1980 by the US physicist Luis Walter Alvarez (1911-88) and his geologist son Walter Jr, based on the unusually high concentration of the element iridium in a thin layer of clay deposited at the end of the Cretaceous (see IRIDIUM ANOMALY). This clay marks the boundary between the Cretaceous period and the more recent Palaeogene (the so-called K-T boundary). Subsequently, geologists discovered a possible impact crater, roughly 160 km in diameter, along the coast of eastern Mexico, and other evidence has tended to support the hypothesis. Such a collision would have produced a massive tidal wave and fireball and sent a vast cloud of rock and other debris into the atmosphere. The resulting upheaval in the climate is estimated to have caused the extinction of some $75 \%$ of all species.
