## Source [^1]
- Machine learning is a branch of [[artificial intelligence]] focused on building systems that learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention 
### Machine Learning Involvement
- Data is needed for training and learning. It can be in many forms such as text, images, or numbers and must be cleaned and processed before use
	- #question how is it cleaned and processed?
	- #question Give examples for forms of data
- [[Algorithm|algorithms]] are the step-by-step procedures or rules that machines use to learn patterns in data. Some common algorithms include [[linear regression]], [[decision tree|decision trees]], and [[neural networks]]

## Source[^2]
- A subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
