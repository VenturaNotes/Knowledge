## Synthesis
- A branch of [[artificial intelligence]] focused on building systems which uses algorithms, techniques, and methodologies to identify patterns and make predictions/decisions when learning from data (without being explicitly programmed). This allows us to build intelligent systems
	- #question What kind of systems do these look like?
	- #question What is meant by intelligent systems? 
	- #question What is the difference between algorithms, techniques, and methodologies?
### Organize
- Algorithms, techniques, and methodologies
In the context of machine learning, these terms relate to different levels of abstraction and scope:

*   **Algorithms**: These are the specific, step-by-step computational procedures or formulas that a machine learning model uses to learn from data and make predictions. They are the core mathematical engines.
    *   *Example*: Linear Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Decision Trees, K-Means Clustering, Neural Networks.
*   **Techniques**: These are broader approaches or specific methods that often involve the application or combination of one or more algorithms, or specific ways of preparing and handling data to achieve a particular learning goal. They describe *how* you apply algorithms or manage data.
    *   *Example*: Supervised Learning, Unsupervised Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Feature Engineering, Cross-validation, Ensemble methods (like Random Forests, which combine multiple Decision Tree algorithms).
*   **Methodologies**: These are systematic frameworks or sets of practices and principles that guide the entire process of developing, deploying, and maintaining a machine learning project. They encompass the overall strategy, from problem definition to deployment and monitoring.
    *   *Example*: CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process for Data Mining), Agile methodologies adapted for ML projects, MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) practices.

In essence:
*   An **algorithm** is the specific recipe for learning.
*   A **technique** is a way of using or combining those recipes, or preparing the ingredients.
*   A **methodology** is the overarching plan and process for the entire cooking project, from planning the meal to serving it.
### Machine Learning Involvement
- Data is needed for training and learning. It can be in many forms such as text, images, or numbers and must be cleaned and processed before use
	- #question how is it cleaned and processed?
	- #question Give examples for forms of data
- [[Algorithm|algorithms]] are the step-by-step procedures or rules that machines use to learn patterns in data. Some common algorithms include [[linear regression]], [[decision tree|decision trees]], and [[neural network|neural networks]]
## Source[^1]
- A subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
## Source[^2]
- A branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the construction of programs that learn from experience. [[Learning]] may take many forms, ranging from learning from examples and learning by analogy to autonomous learning of concepts and learning by discovery.
- [[Incremental learning]] involves continuous improvement as new data arrives while oneshot or [[batch learning]] distinguishes a training phase from the application phase. Supervised learning occurs when the training input has been explicitly labelled with the classes to be learned.
- Most learning methods aim to demonstrate generalization whereby the system develops efficient and effective representations that encompass large chunks of closely related data.
## Source[^3]
- Machine learning (ML) is a computer science that uses data to learn in the way humans do. It is a category that falls under artificial intelligence (AI). ML uses data and algorithms for different technologies, including deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing (NLP). By analyzing data, ML can learn patterns and make decisions without the need for human intervention.
