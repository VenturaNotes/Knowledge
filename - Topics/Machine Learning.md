## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Machine learning is a branch of [[artificial intelligence]] focused on building systems that learn from data, identify patterns, and make decisions with minimal human intervention 
### Machine Learning Involvement
- Data is needed for training and learning. It can be in many forms such as text, images, or numbers and must be cleaned and processed before use
	- #question how is it cleaned and processed?
	- #question Give examples for forms of data
- [[Algorithm|algorithms]] are the step-by-step procedures or rules that machines use to learn patterns in data. Some common algorithms include [[linear regression]], [[decision tree|decision trees]], and [[neural networks]]

## Source[^2]
- A subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.

## Source[^3]
- A branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the construction of programs that learn from experience. Learning may take many forms, ranging from learning from examples and learning by analogy to autonomous learning of concepts and learning by discovery.
- Incremental learning involves continuous improvement as new data arrives while oneshot or [[batch learning]] distinguishes a training phase from the application phase. Supervised learning occurs when the training input has been explicitly labelled with the classes to be learned.
- Most learning methods aim to demonstrate generalization whereby the system develops efficient and effective representations that encompass large chunks of closely related data.
