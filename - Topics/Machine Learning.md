## Synthesis
- A branch of [[artificial intelligence]] focused on building systems which uses algorithms, techniques, and methodologies to identify patterns and make predictions/decisions when learning from data (without being explicitly programmed). This allows us to build intelligent systems
	- #question Is the above statement correct?
	- #question Is predictions/decisions the same thing or is there a distinction depending on the type of problem being worked on?
	- #question What kind of systems do these look like?
	- #question What is meant by intelligent systems? 
	- #question What is the difference between algorithms, techniques, and methodologies?
### Algorithms, Techniques, and Methodologies
- These relate to the different levels of abstraction and scope
	- #question Are there more levels or are these the main 3? 
- Algorithms (mainly for learning)
	- These are computational procedures or formulas which a machine learning model uses to learn from data and make predictions.
		- #question Is it always known as a prediction or a decision as well?
		- #question What is a computational procedure
		- #question What kind of formulas are there?
		- Examples
			- Linear Regression
				- #question Definition and Example
			- Support Vector Machines
				- #question Definition and Example
			- Decision Trees
				- #question Definition and Example
			- K-Means Clustering
				- #question Definition and Example
				- #question Are there other types of clustering?
			- Neural Networks
				- #question Definition and Example
			- #question Are these examples the exhaustive list?
- Techniques (how algorithms are applied or data is managed):  
	* This involves applying one or more algorithms together and preparing/handling data to achieve a particular learning goal
		* #question What kind of learning goals are there? 
		* #question How would you prepare and handle data?
		* #question Is data normalization part of this preparation process?
		* #question Where does techniques usually fall within a setup?
	* Examples
		* Supervised Learning
		* Unsupervised Learning
		* Reinforcement Learning
		* Feature Engineering
		* Cross-validation
		* Ensemble methods
			* Random Forests (combines multiple decision tree algorithms)
		* #question Please give definition and example for each of these
* Methodologies
	* Systematic frameworks which guide the entire process of defining the problem, developing, deploying, and maintaining a machine learning project 
		* #question How do you deploy with machine learning?
	* Examples
		* CRISP-DM (Cross-Industry Standard Process  for Data Mining)
		* Agile methodologies adapted for ML projects
		* MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) practices
		* #question Please give definition and example for each of these
### Machine Learning Involvement
- Data is needed for training and learning. It can be in many forms such as text, images, or numbers and must be cleaned and processed before use
	- #question how is it cleaned and processed?
	- #question Give examples for forms of data
- [[Algorithm|algorithms]] are the step-by-step procedures or rules that machines use to learn patterns in data. Some common algorithms include [[linear regression]], [[decision tree|decision trees]], and [[neural network|neural networks]]
## Source[^1]
- A subset of artificial intelligence that involves training algorithms to recognize patterns and make decisions with minimal human intervention.
## Source[^2]
- A branch of artificial intelligence concerned with the construction of programs that learn from experience. [[Learning]] may take many forms, ranging from learning from examples and learning by analogy to autonomous learning of concepts and learning by discovery.
- [[Incremental learning]] involves continuous improvement as new data arrives while oneshot or [[batch learning]] distinguishes a training phase from the application phase. Supervised learning occurs when the training input has been explicitly labelled with the classes to be learned.
- Most learning methods aim to demonstrate generalization whereby the system develops efficient and effective representations that encompass large chunks of closely related data.
## Source[^3]
- Machine learning (ML) is a computer science that uses data to learn in the way humans do. It is a category that falls under artificial intelligence (AI). ML uses data and algorithms for different technologies, including deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing (NLP). By analyzing data, ML can learn patterns and make decisions without the need for human intervention.
