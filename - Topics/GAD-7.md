- (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire) a self-administered screening tool designed to identify people who may suffer from anxiety disorders. Its seven questions are based on DSM diagnostic criteria for anxiety disorders. Each item is scored from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are taken as the cut-off points for mild, moderate, and severe anxiety, respectively. A score of 10 indicates a reasonably high likelihood of generalized anxiety disorder.
