- The area of main memory that is currently allocated to hold incoming data. The processing system will usually retrieve data from the input area and transfer it to a working area or register before it is processed. The result of the processing may be written to an output area. Subroutines are usually organized so as to replenish the input area from a source such as an input peripheral or communication line and clear the output area by transfer to backing store.
