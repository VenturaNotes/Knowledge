- The theorem that $$\int_C Pdx + Qdy = \int\int_D (\frac{\partial Q}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial P}{\partial y})dA$$for differentiable functions $P(x, y)$ and $Q(x, y)$ defined in a region D of the plane bounded by a simple, closed, positively oriented curve C. This is a special case of Stokes' theorem applied to $\textbf F = (P, Q)$ and is closely connected to Cauchy's integral theorem via the Cauchy-Riemann equations.
