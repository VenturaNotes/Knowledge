## Source [^1]
- (multiprocessor, multiunit processor) A system in which more than one processor may be active at any one time. While the processors are actively executing separate processes they run completely asynchronously. However it is essential to provide synchronization between the processors when they access critical system resources or critical regions of system code. A multiprocessing system is also a multiprogramming system. See also CONCURRENCY.
