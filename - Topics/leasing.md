- Hiring equipment, such as a car or a piece of machinery, to avoid the capital cost involved in owning it. In some companies it is advantageous to use capital for other purposes and to lease some equipment, paying for the hire out of income. The equipment is then an asset of the leasing company rather than the lessor. Sometimes a case can be made for leasing rather than purchasing, on the grounds that some equipment quickly becomes obsolete.

- The practice of hiring items of equipment, rather than buying them outright. This enables firms to operate with less capital than they would need if all their equipment had to be bought. It also shifts to the owners the risk of obsolescence; this will be reflected in the rentals demanded. Leasing may give tax benefits where a new firm has no profits against which it can set tax allowances on any equipment it buys. It may also enable local authorities to avoid cash limits on their expenditure.
