- Baud (Bd) is a unit of data transmission that is used when referring to signal speed. Specifically, it refers to the number of times a signal will change per second. Like other units of measurement when it comes to transmission, a higher baud means a higher signal speed. Bauds are used to calculate transmission rates for computers and modems. Bauds are typically described as BPS, or bauds per second.
## Source[^2]
- A unit that measures the rate at which information is transmitted along a communications link. In normal computer usage, it is equivalent to bits per second (see BINARY NOTATION). Thus, a 300-baud communications link sends 300 bits of information per second.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A unit of information transmission speed corresponding to one unit or bit per second. See also information (2). Kbaud or kilobaud $n$. Thousands of bits or units per second. \[Named after the French engineer and inventor of the first successful teleprinter, Jean-Maurice-Ã‰mile Baudot (1845-1903)]
