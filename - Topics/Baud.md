- Baud (Bd) is a unit of data transmission that is used when referring to signal speed. Specifically, it refers to the number of times a signal will change per second. Like other units of measurement when it comes to transmission, a higher baud means a higher signal speed. Bauds are used to calculate transmission rates for computers and modems. Bauds are typically described as BPS, or bauds per second.

- A unit that measures the rate at which information is transmitted along a communications link. In normal computer usage, it is equivalent to bits per second (see BINARY NOTATION). Thus, a 300-baud communications link sends 300 bits of information per second.
