- Baud (Bd) is a unit of data transmission that is used when referring to signal speed. Specifically, it refers to the number of times a signal will change per second. Like other units of measurement when it comes to transmission, a higher baud means a higher signal speed. Bauds are used to calculate transmission rates for computers and modems. Bauds are typically described as BPS, or bauds per second.
