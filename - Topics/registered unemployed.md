- Unemployed persons in receipt of unemployment-related benefits (also known as 'claimants'). This means that they are unemployed in the view of the official agencies responsible for administering benefits. This definition of unemployment differs from that based on labor force surveys, which record the numbers of those who consider themselves to be unemployed. In the UK the registered unemployed figure is usually around 1 per cent of the labor force below that produced by labor force surveys.
