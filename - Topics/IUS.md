- (intrauterine system) a hormonal contraceptive device consisting of a plastic T-shaped frame that is inserted into the uterus. It carries a progestogen (levonorgestrel) in a sleeve around its stem and has two fine threads attached to its base, by which it can be removed. It provides a longterm method of contraception that is also reversible. The IUS is also used in the treatment of menorrhagia and benign endometrial hyperplasia as it acts by thinning the endometrium. A newer version delivers a smaller amount of levonorgestrel and is suitable for young women who have not been pregnant; it is not licensed for menorrhagia or for use after the menopause.
