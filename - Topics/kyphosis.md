- $n$. outward curvature of the spine, which if excessive causes hunching of the back. A mobile kyphosis may be caused by bad posture or muscle weakness or may develop to compensate for another condition, such as hip deformity; it can be corrected by backward bending. A fixed kyphosis may be congenital; it may arise in adolescence (see Scheuermann's disease); or it may result from collapse of the vertebrae, as in osteoporosis, ankylosing spondylitis, infections, or tumors. Treatment depends on the cause and may include physiotherapy, bracing, and surgery (spinal osteotomy and fusion may be required in severe cases). See also KYPHOS; KYPHOSCOLIOSIS.
