## Synthesis

- A combination of two different atoms that exists only in an excited state. When an exciplex emits a photon of electromagnetic radiation, it immediately dissociates into the atoms, rather than reverting to the ground state. A similar transient excited association of two atoms of the same kind is an excimer. An example of an exciplex is the species XeCl* (the asterisk indicates an excited state), which can be formed by an electric discharge in xenon and chlorine. This is used in the exciplex laser, in which a population inversion is produced by an electrical discharge.
