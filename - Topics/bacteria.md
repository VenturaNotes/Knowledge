- pl. n. (sing. bacterium) a group of microorganisms all of which lack a distinct nuclear membrane (and hence are considered more primitive than animal and plant cells) and most of which have a cell wall of unique composition (many antibiotics act by destroying the bacterial cell wall). Most bacteria are unicellular; the cells may be spherical (coccus), rodshaped (bacillus), spiral (Spirillum), comma-shaped (Vibrio), or corkscrew-shaped (spirochaete). Generally, they range in size between 0.5 and $5 \mu \mathrm{m}$. Motile species bear one or more fine hairs (flagella) arising from their surface. Many possess an outer slimy capsule, and some have the ability to produce an encysted or resting form (endospore). Bacteria reproduce asexually by simple division of cells; incomplete separation of daughter cells leads to the formation of colonies consisting of different numbers and arrangements of cells. Some colonies are filamentous in shape, resembling those of fungi. Transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another takes place in the process of conjugation.
- Bacteria are very widely distributed. Some live in soil, water, or air; others are parasites of humans, animals, and plants. Many parasitic bacteria do not harm their hosts; some cause diseases by producing poisons (see ENDOTOXIN; EXOTOXIN).
