- pl. n. (sing. bacterium) a group of microorganisms all of which lack a distinct nuclear membrane (and hence are considered more primitive than animal and plant cells) and most of which have a cell wall of unique composition (many antibiotics act by destroying the bacterial cell wall). Most bacteria are unicellular; the cells may be spherical (coccus), rodshaped (bacillus), spiral (Spirillum), comma-shaped (Vibrio), or corkscrew-shaped (spirochaete). Generally, they range in size between 0.5 and $5 ~\mu \mathrm{m}$. Motile species bear one or more fine hairs (flagella) arising from their surface. Many possess an outer slimy capsule, and some have the ability to produce an encysted or resting form (endospore). Bacteria reproduce asexually by simple division of cells; incomplete separation of daughter cells leads to the formation of colonies consisting of different numbers and arrangements of cells. Some colonies are filamentous in shape, resembling those of fungi. Transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another takes place in the process of conjugation.
- Bacteria are very widely distributed. Some live in soil, water, or air; others are parasites of humans, animals, and plants. Many parasitic bacteria do not harm their hosts; some cause diseases by producing poisons (see ENDOTOXIN; EXOTOXIN).

- (Eubacteria) A domain of life containing a diverse group of ubiquitous microorganisms all of which consist of only a single cell that lacks a distinct nuclear membrane and has a cell wall of a unique composition (see illustration). Bacteria constitute the prokaryotic organisms of the living world. However, their classification is a controversial issue. It is now recognized, on the basis of differences in ribosomal RNA structure and nucleotide sequences (see MOLECULAR SYSTEMATICS), that prokaryotes form two evolutionarily distinct domains: Archaea (the archaea) and Bacteria. Defining characteristics of bacteria include the possession of cell walls containing peptidoglycan, and membrane lipids containing fatty acids in ester linkage to glycerol, whereas archaea lack peptidoglycan and have ether-linked lipids. However, in general parlance, the term 'bacteria' can still, erroneously, encompass both archaea and bacteria.
- Bacteria can be characterized in a number of ways, for example by their reaction with Gram's stain, their GC content, or on the basis of their metabolic requirements (e.g. whether or not they require oxygen: see AEROBIC RESPIRATION; ANAEROBIC RESPIRATION) and shape. A bacterial cell may be spherical (see COCCUS), rodlike (see BACILLUS), spiral (see SPIRILLUM), comma-shaped (see VIBRIO), corkscrew-shaped (see SPIROCHAETE), or filamentous, resembling a fungal cell. The majority of bacteria range in size from 0.5 to 5 $\mu \mathrm{m}$. Many are motile, bearing flagella, possess an outer slimy capsule, and produce resistant spores (see ENDOSPORE). In general bacteria reproduce only asexually, by simple division of cells, but a few groups undergo a form of sexual reproduction (see CONJUGATION) and lateral gene transfer is common. Bacteria are largely responsible for decay and decomposition of organic matter, producing a cycling of such chemicals as carbon (see CARBON CYCLE), oxygen, nitrogen (see NITROGEN CYCLE), and sulphur (see SULPHUR CYCLE). A few bacteria obtain their food by means of photosynthesis, including the Cyanobacteria; some are saprotrophs; and others are parasites, causing disease. The symptoms of bacterial infections are produced by toxins.
