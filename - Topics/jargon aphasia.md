- $n$. A form of fluent aphasia characterized by a copious flow of unintelligible speech. Jargon-aphasic speech may be subdivided into semantic jargon, in which ordinary words are strung together to form unintelligible utterances, such as automatic winding voice and the very very recording, and phonemic jargon involving neologisms, such as I've not norter with the verker. See also aphasia.
