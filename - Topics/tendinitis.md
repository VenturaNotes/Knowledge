- $n$. inflammation of a tendon. It occurs most commonly after excessive overuse but is sometimes due to bacterial infection (e.g. gonorrhoea), or a generalized rheumatic disease (e.g. rheumatoid arthritis or ankylosing spondylitis). Treatment is by rest, achieved sometimes by splinting the adjacent joint, and corticosteroid injection into the tender area around the tendon. Tendinitis at the insertion of the supraspinatus muscle is a frequent cause of pain and restricted movement in the shoulder. See also JUMPER'S KNEE; TENNIS ELBOW. Compare TENOSYNOVITIS.
