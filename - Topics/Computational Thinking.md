## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Refers to the thought processes involved in formulating problems so their solutions can be represented as computational steps and algorithms
## Source[^2]
- Computational thinking
	- Helps you to solve problems
	- Combines different techniques, such as pattern recognition and algorithm design
	- Can be used in "real life" situations as well
- (1) Chloe runs a movie review website. She wants to summarize the plot of films she has just watched to include just the key information. Which computational thinking technique should she use?
	- [[Abstraction]]
- (2) Nisha has moved house and draws her friend a map so that she can get to her new house. Which computational thinking technique should she use when drawing the map?
	- [[Abstraction]]
