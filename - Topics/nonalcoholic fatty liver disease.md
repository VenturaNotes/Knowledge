- (NAFLD) a spectrum of conditions affecting the liver in the absence of excessive alcohol consumption. NAFLD is a common cause of referral for patients with abnormal liver function tests. Fatty liver is excessive fat accumulation in the liver seen as an area of brightness within the liver on ultrasound examination. Fatty liver does not lead to irreversible liver damage in the majority of cases. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is inflammation of the liver associated with accumulation of fat. It is often linked to insulin resistance, diabetes, hypertension, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Treatment involves dietary modification, regular physical exercise, weight reduction, and management of underlying conditions (e.g. diabetes, hypertension, and hiperlipidaemia). NASH may predispose to cirrhosis and may ultimately require liver transplantation.
