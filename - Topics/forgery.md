- The legal offence of making a false instrument in order that it may be accepted as genuine, thereby causing harm to others. Under the Forgery and Counterfeiting Act 1981, an instrument may be a document or any device on which information is recorded. An instrument is considered false, for example, if it purports to have been made or altered by someone who did not do so, on a date or at a place when it was not, or by someone who does not exist. It is also an offence to copy or use a false instrument knowing it to be false or to make or possess any material meant to be used to produce such specified false instruments as money, cheques, share certificates, credit or debit cards, passports, or registration certificates.
