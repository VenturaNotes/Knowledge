- The single executive body formed in 1967 (as the Commission of the European Communities) from the three separate executive bodies of the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Atomic Energy Community, and the European Economic Community. It now consists of 28 Commissioners, one from each member state (France, Germany, Italy, Spain, and the UK were formerly allotted two Commissioners each). The Commissioners accept joint responsibility for their decisions, which are taken on the basis of a majority vote. The Commission initiates and implements EU legislation and mediates between member governments. The Commissioners are backed by a staff of some 33,000 civil servants.
