- Statistical time-division multiplexing (STDM) refers to a type of link sharing that occurs in communication networks. In STDM, a communications channel is divided into separate streams. Link sharing is then utilized to speed the flow of data from one end of a communications network to another. The information may not be delivered simultaneously, which increases the networkâ€™s overall efficiency. Statistical time-division multiplexing is not used to control transmissions. Instead, the demand of transmissions controls when STDM takes effect.
