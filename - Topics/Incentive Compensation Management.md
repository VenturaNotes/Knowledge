- Incentive compensation management (ICM) is a system that allows companies to manage their employees' pay. This can include setting up goals and objectives for employees and awarding bonuses or other forms of compensation based on how well they meet those goals. ICM helps businesses perform better by ensuring that employees are rewarded for their work.
