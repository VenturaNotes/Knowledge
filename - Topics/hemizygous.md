- adj. describing genes that are carried on an unpaired chromosome, for example the genes on the X chromosome in males. $\textemdash$hemizygote $n$.
## Source[^2]
- Describing a diploid organism or cell that contains only a single copy of a particular gene. For example, genes that are not present on the smaller of the sex chromosomes in humans, the Y chromosome, occur only on the X chromosome; hence males are hemizygous for such genes.
## Source[^3]
- adj. Having only one gene or chromosome, without its homologous counterpart. Thus, for example, males of the human and other mammalian species are hemizygous for their X and Y chromosomes, and consequently for certain genes carried on those chromosomes. \[From Greek hemi- half + Greek zygon a yoke + -ous having or characterized by]
