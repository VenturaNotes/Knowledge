- A model of a particle, such as an atom or molecule, in which it is regarded as an impenetrable sphere. There are many aspects of solids and liquids, particularly structure and packing, that are well represented by a collection of hard spheres. Hard sphere representations of solids and liquids have been studied extensively both analytically and by using computers.
