- A particular form of association between entities found in object-oriented approaches to design, programming, etc. The association is used to indicate a hierarchy of objects such that objects lower in the hierarchy inherit properties from those higher in the hierarchy. Thus objects lower in the hierarchy are more specialized, whereas objects higher in the hierarchy are more generalized.
