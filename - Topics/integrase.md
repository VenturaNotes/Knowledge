- An enzyme encoded by retroviruses, such as HIV, that catalyses the integration of the double-stranded DNA copy of the viral genome into the DNA of the host cell. Integrase inhibitors are a class of drugs used to treat HIV and other retroviral infections, usually in combination with other forms of antiretroviral therapy. They block the action of the viral integrase.
