- The condition in a plant cell or other cell with a semirigid cell wall (i.e. cells of archaea, bacteria, fungi, and some protists) when the force causing water to enter the cell by osmosis is balanced by the pressure of the fluid cell constituents (i.e. the protoplast) pushing against the cell wall$\textemdash$i.e. the turgor pressure. A state of turgor thus prevents further water from entering the cell. The turgor pressure is thus comparable in magnitude to the pressure potential, which is the pressure exerted by the cell on the watery cell contents; the pressure potential is significantly positive when the cell is turgid. Turgidity assists in maintaining the rigidity of plants; a decrease in turgidity leads to wilting. See also water potential. Compare PLASMOLYSIS.
