- $n$. pathological fusion of two bones across a joint space resulting from prolonged joint inflammation or infection. In bony ankylosis the joint space is obliterated by bony tissue as a result of chronic inflammatory conditions, such as ankylosing spondylitis psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, or septic arthritis. Fibrous ankylosis, in which there is a shortening of the connecting fibrous tissue, results from healing with fibrosis and is commonly associated with chronic arthritis due to tuberculous infection.
