- A rounded granular body, bounded by a double membrane, found in the hyphae of filamentous ascomycote fungi. One or more Woronin bodies are closely associated with the pore in each cross-wall (septum) of the hyphae. If the hypha is injured, the Woronin body is swept by the flow of cytoplasm to plug the pore and minimize further damage. It is named after the Russian mycologist Mikhail Woronin (1838-1903).
