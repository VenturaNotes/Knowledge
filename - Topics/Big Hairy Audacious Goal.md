- (BHAG) A very ambitious long-term objective that serves to galvanize effort and build team spirit within a company. The concept was introduced by Jim Collins and Jerry Porras of Stanford University in the mid 1990s. They argued that an effective BHAG should be (a) audacious enough to be inspiring; (b) clear and unambiguous, so that it is obvious when the goal has been reached; (c) consistent with the company's core values and purposes; and (d) realizable over 10 to 30 years.
