- (talipes) $n$. a congenital deformity of one or both feet in which the patient cannot stand with the sole of the foot flat on the ground. In the most common variety (congenital talipes equinovarus) the foot points downwards, the heel is inverted, and the forefoot twisted. It is diagnosed at birth and may be associated with other congenital abnormalities. Treatment is initially by physiotherapy and strapping or a plaster cast, but if this fails to correct the deformity surgical correction is performed. Other varieties are talipes varus, inward deviation of the hind foot; and talipes valgus, an outward deviation of the hind foot, which is much less common.
