- A network appliance is a type of computing appliance that supports the flow of information to other network-connected computing devices. For example, a network appliance service for firewall protection can create a barrier between a network and the internet to improve safety and block unwanted network connections. A network appliance service for WiFi manages settings for wireless networks such as bandwidth and security. Other services provided by network appliances include caching, IP address management, and network address translation.
