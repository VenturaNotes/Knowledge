- An advanced clinical research information system (ACRIS) is a complex IT system that aids healthcare organizations conducting clinical trials. These systems are typically multifaceted; an ACRIS helps manage patients, stores patient data, documents patient care, analyzes files to develop smarter research questions, and more. An ACRIS can also support related translational research, biostatistics, and biocomputation activities. These systems are related to—but distinct from—electronic medical record (EMR) systems, which are more general solutions that store full patient records.
