- adj. relating to or describing conditions of bright illumination. For example, photopic vision is vision in bright light, in which the cones of the retina are responsible for visual sensation. $\textemdash$photopia $n$.
## Source[^2]
- adj. Of, relating to, or governed by the cone-mediated visual system that functions when the eyes are light-adapted for bright illumination or day vision. It is maximally sensitive to light falling on the fovea, and it has peak sensitivity at a wavelength of 555 nanometres (green light), but it responds to light across the entire visible spectrum, operating with three different types of photoreceptors that normally provide color vision, and it is less sensitive than the scotopic system except for wavelengths above 650 nanometres (in the red region of the spectrum), where the sensitivities of the two systems are similar. See also duplexity FUNCTION, FIELD ADAPTATION, HEMERALOPIA, LIGHT ADAPTATION, PHOTOPIC luminosity curve, Purkinje shift, Stiles-Crawford effect. Compare MESOPIC, SCOTOPIC. photopia $n$. Photopic vision, also called daylight vision. Compare SCOTOPIA. \[From Greek phos, photos light + ops an eye + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
