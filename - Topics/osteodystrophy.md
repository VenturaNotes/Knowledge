In renal osteodystrophy chronic kidney failure leads to diffuse bone changes resulting from a number of factors, including osteomalacia, secondary hyperparathyroidism stimulated by hypocalcaemia and hyperphosphataemia, acidosis from the renal failure, and metastatic calcification related to high levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood.
