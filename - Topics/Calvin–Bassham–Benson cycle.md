- (photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle; reductive pentose phosphate cycle) The metabolic pathway of the light-independent stage of photosynthesis, which occurs in the stroma of the chloroplasts. The pathway was elucidated by Melvin Calvin, James Bassham (1922-2012), and Andrew Benson (1917-2015), and involves the fixation of carbon dioxide and its subsequent reduction to carbohydrate. During the cycle, carbon dioxide combines with ribulose bisphosphate, through the mediation of the enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (rubisco), to form an unstable sixcarbon compound that breaks down to form two molecules of the three-carbon compound glycerate 3-phosphate. This is converted to glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate, which is used to regenerate ribulose bisphosphate and to produce glucose and fructose. The cycle depends on ATP supplied by the light-dependent reactions, and it generally ceases in the dark.
