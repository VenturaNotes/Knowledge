- A means of referring to particular elements in an ordered collection of elements. For example, if R denotes such a collection of names then the $i$ th name in the collection may be referenced by $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{i}}$ (i.e. R subscript i). This printed form is the origin of the term but it is also used when the 'subscript' is written on the same line, usually in parentheses or brackets:$$R(i) \text{ or } R[i]$$See also ARRAY, INDEX.
