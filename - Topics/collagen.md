## Source [^1]
- An insoluble fibrous protein found extensively in the connective tissue of skin, tendons, and bone, in the walls of the large arteries, and in the extracellular matrix . The polypeptide chains of collagen (containing the amino acids glycine and proline predominantly) form triple-stranded helical coils that are bound together to form fibrils, which have great strength and limited elasticity. Collagen accounts for over 25% of the total body protein of mammals.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a protein that is the principal constituent of white fibrous connective tissue (as occurs in tendons). Collagen is also found in skin, bone, cartilage, and ligaments. It is relatively inelastic but has a high tensile strength.
