- An insoluble fibrous protein found extensively in the connective tissue of skin, tendons, and bone, in the walls of the large arteries, and in the extracellular matrix . The polypeptide chains of collagen (containing the amino acids glycine and proline predominantly) form triple-stranded helical coils that are bound together to form fibrils, which have great strength and limited elasticity. Collagen accounts for over 25% of the total body protein of mammals.
