- $n$. 
- (1) an agent that can convert the inactive form of an enzyme (see PROENZYME) to the active form. 
- (2) an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of phosphate groups. An example is phosphofructokinase.
## Source[^2]
- (phosphokinase) An enzyme that can transfer a phosphate group from a high-energy phosphate, such as ATP, to an organic molecule. Phosphorylation is normally required to activate the molecule, which is often an enzyme. For example, kinases activate the precursors of enzymes secreted in pancreatic juice (see ChYMOTRYPSIN; TRYPSIN). See also PROTEIN KINASE; TYROSINE KINASE.
