- (1) the normal state of slight contraction, or readiness to contract, of healthy muscle fibres. 
- (2) the effective osmotic pressure of a solution. See HYPERTONIC; HYPOTONIC; OSMOSIS.
## Source[^2]
- (1) The effective osmotic pressure of a solution relative to another solution from which it is separated by a membrane permeable only to water molecules. It is determined by the concentration of nonpenetrating solutes in the solution relative to that in the other solution. Hence, the tonicity of a solution surrounding a cell determines whether the solution will cause water to flow in or out of the cell across the plasma membrane. A hypertonic solution will cause water to flow out of the cell, whereas a hypotonic solution will cause water to flow into the cell. If the solution is isotonic, there will be no net flow of water across the cell membrane. See osmosis. 
- (2) The degree of muscle tone.
