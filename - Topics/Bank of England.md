- The UK central bank. Originally founded in 1694 as a private bank to lend to the government and manage the national debt, by the 19th century it had developed into a central bank. In 1844 the Bank Charter Act formalized its status. Its main functions were controlling the money supply, through the Issue Department, and acting as a banker for the government and other banks, through the Banking Department. The bank came under formal government ownership when it was nationalized in 1946. The Governor and Directors are now appointed by the government. The Bank of England administered exchange controls until these were abolished in 1979, and advised the government on monetary policy until 1997, when it was made independent. It holds the national foreign exchange reserves, in the Exchange Equalization Account, and manages the national debt. It is also responsible for supervision of the banking system, and acts as lender of last resort in financial crises.
