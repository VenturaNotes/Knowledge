- The theory that the price level is proportional to the quantity of money. This is expressed by the quantity equation, $M V=P T$, where $M$ is the quantity of money, $V$ is the velocity of circulation, $P$ is the price level, and $T$ is the volume of transactions. The quantity theory assumes that $T$ is determined by supply-side forces, which determine the level of real output, and institutional factors, which determine the ratio of total transactions to output; and $V$ is determined by the legal status and operating habits of the financial system. These assumptions allow $T$ and $V$ to be treated as fixed. The quantity equation then implies that $P$ must be proportional to $M$. This reasoning supports the assertion of Milton Friedman (1912-2006) that inflation is caused by increases in the money supply. If $T$ and $V$ are not taken as fixed the direct link between money and prices is lost and a broader range of economic considerations enters the analysis.
