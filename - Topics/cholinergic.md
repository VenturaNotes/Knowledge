- adj. 
- (1) describing nerve fibers that release acetylcholine as a neurotransmitter. 
- (2) describing receptors at which acetylcholine acts to pass on messages from cholinergic nerve fibers. 
- (3) describing drugs that mimic the actions of acetylcholine (see PARASYMPATHOMIMETIC). Compare ADRENERGIC.
## Source[^2]
- Describing a nerve fibre that either releases acetylcholine when stimulated or is itself stimulated by acetylcholine. Compare ADRENERGIC.
## Source[^3]
- adj. Releasing acetylcholine; also activated by or responding to acetylcholine, this extended usage being widespread but consistently rejected by the English physiologist Sir Henry Hallet Dale (1875-1968), who coined the suffix -ergic, and by many other authorities. The term applies especially to nerve fibers such as those in the parasympathetic nervous system or in the nucleus basalis of Meynert that use acetylcholine as their neurotransmitter, or any drug that stimulates the activity of the parasympathetic nervous system, causing such effects as constriction of the pupils of the eyes and preparation for close-up vision, salivation, slowing of the heart, secretion of gastric juices, and voiding of urine. See also MUSCARINIC RECEPTOR, NICOTINIC RECEPTOR. Compare ADRENERGIC, ANTICHOLINERGIC, DOPAMINERGIC, GABAERGIC, NORADRENERGIC, SEROTONERGIC. \[From (acetyl)cholin(e) + Greek ergon work + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
