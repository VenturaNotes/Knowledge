- (MenC) a vaccine that provides protection against the C strain of the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis (the meningococcus), which accounts for approximately $50 \%$ of all cases of meningococcal meningitis and tends to occur in clusters. Owing to the success of the MenC vaccination programme begun in 1999 there have been almost no recent cases of meningitis C disease in babies and young children in the UK. The vaccine was previously offered to all babies at 12 weeks of age but is now given at 12 months as part of Hib/MenC vaccine and at 14 years as the MenACWY vaccine.
