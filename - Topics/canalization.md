- (in evolutionary genetics) A developmental mechanism that limits variation of the phenotype within narrow bounds by repressing underlying genetic variation. It thus maintains a fairly uniform phenotype over a range of different environments in which the organism might normally occur. Canalization is achieved by various genes concerned with development and stress responses. Mutation of these, or exposure to extreme environmental stress, will uncover the genetic variation hitherto hidden by canalization, enabling the population to undergo rapid evolution.
