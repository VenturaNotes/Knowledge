- Movement of capital between countries. Capital outflow (or outward capital movement) is the movement of domestically owned capital abroad; capital inflow (or inward capital movement) is the movement of foreign-owned capital into a country. Capital movements may take the form of foreign direct investment, that is, investment in real capital assets, the purchase of shares, or long- or short-term loans. All such movements form part of the capital account of the balance of payments. See also SHORT-RUN CAPITAL MOVEMENTS.
