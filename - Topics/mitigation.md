- Policies and actions aimed at limiting the extent of global warming primarily by reducing the level of greenhouse gases emitted into the atmosphere. These include technological changes reducing emissions of carbon dioxide, such as switching from fossil fuels to wind and solar power generation, development of carbon sequestration technologies removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, improvements in energy efficiency of existing production processes, and changes in consumer behavior.
