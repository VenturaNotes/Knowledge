- In good faith, honestly, without collusion or fraud. A bona fide purchaser for value without notice is a person who has bought property in good faith, without being aware of prior claims to it (for example, that it is subject to a trust). The purchaser will not be bound by those claims, unless (if the property is land) they were registered.
