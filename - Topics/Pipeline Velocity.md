- Pipeline velocity is a measurement of how fast qualified leads move through the sales process. The higher the pipeline velocity, the quicker the sales process is moving. This speed can be a good indicator of how efficiently the team works and how well they target their leads. It can also help track whether a business's marketing efforts result in more quality leads.
