- (TEN, Lyell's syndrome) a severe reaction to medications with a high mortality rate. Medications causing TEN include sulfonamides, anticonvulsants, antiretrovirals, and allopurinol. Widespread separation of the dead epidermal layer from underlying skin occurs, with consequent problems due to skin failure: impaired temperature regulation, infection risk, severe pain, etc. Mucous membranes are commonly affected, including the eyes (sometimes leading to blindness), mouth, and genitalia. Multi-organ failure may occur. Treatments include stopping the offending medication, good supportive nursing (usually in an ITU or HDU setting), antibiotics where appropriate, and intravenous immunoglobulin or ciclosporin.
