A neural pathway closely associated with emotional experiences, including many of the structures of and around the limbic system, running from the thalamus through the cingulate gyrus, entorhinal cortex, hippocampus, septum pellucidum, hypothalamus, and mammillary bodies, before returning to the thalamus. \[Named after the US neuroanatomist James W. Papez (1883-1958) who first described it in 1937]
