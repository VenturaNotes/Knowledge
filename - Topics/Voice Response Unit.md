- A voice response unit (VRU) is a telephone answering system that provides callers with a variety of pre-recorded messages. The system uses voice recognition or buttons on a touch-tone phone as responses to a set menu of options to help users find what they are looking for. VRUs consist of both software and hardware and can be used for applications including account transactions/payments or routing customers to live agents. A VRU is often part of a complete call processing/call center system and is also known as IVR (interactive voice response) technology.
