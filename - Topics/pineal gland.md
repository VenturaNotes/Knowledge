## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- It's made up of secretory cells called pinealocytes, which secrete melatonin throughout the 24-hour cycle.
## Source[^2]
- (pineal body) a pea-sized mass of nerve tissue attached by a stalk to the posterior wall of the third ventricle of the brain, deep between the cerebral hemispheres at the back of the skull. It secretes the hormone melatonin. The gland becomes calcified as age progresses, providing a useful landmark in X-rays of the skull. Anatomical name: epiphysis.
## Source[^3]
- An endocrine gland located between the two cerebral hemispheres and connected to the forebrain by a stalk. In humans and other mammals it produces the hormone melatonin during the hours of darkness on a circadian (24-hour) cycle, according to timing signals received from two structures in the left and right hypothalamus, the suprachiasmatic nuclei (see BIOLOGICAL CLOCK). In many other vertebrates the equivalent structure is the pineal sac, which may be associated with a light-sensitive median eye.
