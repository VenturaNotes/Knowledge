- $n$. a benign tumor growing from the fibrous coverings of a peripheral nerve: it arises from Schwann cells, lacks a capsule (therefore it may incorporate nerve fibres), and is usually symptomless. When it develops from the sheath of a nerve root, it causes pain and may compress the spinal cord. A schwannoma is similar but encapsulated (sometimes the terms are used synonymously).
