- The logical connective combining two statements, truth values, or formulas $P$ and $Q$ in such a way that the outcome is true if either $P$ or $Q$ (but not both $P$ and $Q$ ) is true, as shown in the diagram. Since the outcome is true precisely when the operands are different, it is sometimes referred to as the nonequivalence operation. It can be represented in a variety of ways, the more common methods being XOR, xor, and V. See also OR OPERATION.
