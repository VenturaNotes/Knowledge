- $n$. a potassium-sparing diuretic that causes the increased excretion of sodium and chloride; it is often combined with a thiazide or loop diuretic (e.g. hydrochlorothiazide as co-amilozide) to reduce the potassium loss that occurs with these drugs. Amiloride may produce dizziness and weakness and its continued use may lead to an excessive concentration of potassium in the blood.
