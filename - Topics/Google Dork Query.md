- A Google dork query is a custom Google search query that uses a specific string of advanced search operators to locate information that is not intended for public viewing on the internet. Google dork queries allow cyber hackers to identify log files that contain account usernames and passwords, financial information, camera security vulnerabilities, and other sensitive data. Cyber hackers then use this sensitive information to commit identity theft, participate in cyberwarfare, and spy on individuals through their device ªs camera. Businesses often follow cybersecurity best practices to prevent Google dork queries from uncovering their personal data. These practices include, when possible, refraining from indexing websites that contain sensitive data online and using a directory-level configuration file (.htaccess) to protect company directories from hackers.
