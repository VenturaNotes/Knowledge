- Workforce management (WFM) is a system that improves agent productivity. Used in a call center environment, WFM predicts staffing levels based on factors such as incoming call volumes and staff availability. WFM can predict the number of agents required to handle calls at specific times of the day, week, or month by analyzing historical calling records from an automatic call distribution system. Features of a WFM system include reporting, agent scheduling, meeting and vacation planning.
