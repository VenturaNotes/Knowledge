- The group of central banks comprising the European Central Bank and the central banks of all 28 member states of the EU (i.e. including those countries that are not in the eurozone). Its objectives are the maintenance of price stability throughout the EU and the facilitation of monetary cooperation between the eurozone countries and other members of the EU.

- (ESCB) The system is composed of the European Central Bank and the central banks of all 28 European Union member states. Not all member states have adopted the euro so the ESCB cannot act as the monetary authority for the eurozone. This task is undertaken by the Eurosystem.
