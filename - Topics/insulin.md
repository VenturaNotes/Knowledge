- $n$. a protein hormone, produced in the pancreas by the beta cells of the islets of Langerhans, that is crucial in regulating the amount of sugar (glucose) in the blood. Insulin secretion is stimulated by a high concentration of blood sugar. Lack of this hormone gives rise to diabetes mellitus, in which large amounts of sugar are present in the blood and urine. This condition may be treated successfully by insulin injections (see INSULIN ANALOGUES; INSULIN PEN; ISOPHANE INSULINS). See also CONTINUOUS SUBCUTANEOUS INSULIN INFUSION.
