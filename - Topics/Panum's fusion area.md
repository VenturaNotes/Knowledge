- $n$. An area of space, surrounding the horopter for a given degree of ocular convergence, within which different points projected on to the left and right retinas result in binocular fusion, producing a sensation of visual depth, and points lying outside the area result in diplopia. It is really a volume rather than an area, because it is a three-dimensional shape with a curved surface. Near the fovea, the maximum binocular disparity resulting in binocular fusion corresponds to a visual angle of about 10 minutes of arc or $1 / 6$ of one degree. PFA abbrev. \[Named after the Danish physician and physiologist Peter Ludvig Panum (1820-85) who first described it in 1858]
