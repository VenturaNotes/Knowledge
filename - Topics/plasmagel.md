- The specialized outer gel-like cytoplasm of living cells (such as Amoeba) that move by extruding part of the cell (known as a pseudopodium) in the direction of motion. A reversible conversion of plasmagel to the more fluid plasmasol is involved in the continuous flow forward of cytoplasm necessary for forming a pseudopodium (see AMOEBOID MOVEMENT). See also CYTOPLASMIC STREAMING.
