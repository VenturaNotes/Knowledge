- $n$. In statistics, an index of the degree of association between two truly dichotomous variables, such as male/female or pass/fail. Mathematically it is equivalent to the product-moment correlation coefficient applied to two dichotomous variables, and in practice it is most often used to analyze data in contingency tables. Symbol: $\upphi$. Compare Cramér's C, CONTINGENCY COEFFICIENT.
