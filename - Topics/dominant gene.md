- $n$. A gene displaying dominance (genetic) in the sense that if it is inherited from one parent it tends to produce the same phenotype in the organism whether the corresponding allele inherited from the other parent is the same or different. For example, the gene for brown eyes is dominant and the allele for blue eyes is recessive, so an individual who is heterozygous at this locus will have brown eyes, and only an individual with two blue-eyed alleles will be phenotypically blue-eyed. Also (less commonly but more accurately) called a dominant allele. See also SEX-INFLUENCED TRAIT. Compare RECESSIVE GENE.
