- n. A cluster of nerve cell bodies in the medulla oblongata, with neural connections to the flocculonodular lobe of the cerebellum, receiving afferent impulses from the semicircular canals via the vestibular nerve, and sending efferent motor impulses to the spinal cord and cerebral cortex. It controls equilibrium, muscular tonus, and conjugate eye movements. Often misspelt Deiter's nucleus. \[Named after the German anatomist Otto F. K. Deiters (1834-63) who discovered it]
