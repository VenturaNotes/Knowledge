- $n$. an institution that provides palliative or end-of-life care for people with terminal illnesses. Most modern hospices are modelled on St Christopher's Hospice, founded in London in 1967 by Dame Cicely Saunders. They specialize in symptom management and often also provide spiritual and psychological help. Support for the families of the patients is also a feature of the services provided by most hospices. Hospice at Home services provide specialist palliative care for terminally ill patients in their own homes. See also DYING; PALLIATIVE.
