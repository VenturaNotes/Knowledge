## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. the sudden surge of charged particles across the membrane of a nerve cell or a muscle cell that accompanies a physicochemical change in the membrane and cancels out, or reverses, its resting potential to produce an action potential. The passage of a nerve impulse is a rapid wave of depolarization along the membrane of a nerve fibre.
## Source[^2]
- A reduction in the difference of electrical potential that exists across the plasma membrane of a cell, i.e. in the cell's resting potential. A large, transient depolarization of a nerve-cell membrane occurs during the passage of an action potential along the axon when the nerve is transmitting an impulse.
