- (expansion) The series$$1+\frac{\alpha}{1!} x+\frac{\alpha(\alpha-1)}{2!} x^{2}+\cdots+\frac{\alpha(\alpha-1) \ldots(\alpha-n+1)}{n!} x^{n}+\cdots,$$being the Taylor series for the function $(1+x)^{\alpha}$. In general, it is valid for $-1<x<1$. In fact, the series converges for complex $x$ with modulus less than 1 , but then care is needed interpreting the sum as $(1+x)^{\alpha}$ (see BRANCH). If $\alpha$ is a non-negative integer, the expansion is a finite series and so is a polynomial, and then it is equal to $(1+x)^{\alpha}$ for all $x$.
