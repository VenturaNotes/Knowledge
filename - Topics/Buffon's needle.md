- Suppose that a needle of length $l$ is dropped at random onto a set of parallel lines a distance $d$ apart, where $l<d$. The probability that the needle lands crossing one of the lines can be shown to equal $2 l /(\pi d)$. The experiment in which this is repeated many times to estimate the value of $\pi$ is called Buffon's needle. It was proposed by Georges Louis Leclerc, Comte de Buffon (1707-88).
