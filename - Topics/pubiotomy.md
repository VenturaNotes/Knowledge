- $n$. an operation to divide the pubic bone near the symphysis, the front midline where the left and right pubic bones meet. Pubiotomy is now only rarely performed during childbirth if it is necessary to increase the size of an abnormally small pelvis to allow passage of the child and a Caesarean section is contraindicated. It is occasionally also done to facilitate access to the base of the bladder and the urethra during complex urological procedures (e.g. urethroplasty).
