- $n$. a facing of composite resin or porcelain applied to the surface of a tooth to give improved shape and/or color. The tooth usually requires minimal preparation and the facing is retained by enamel that has been treated by the acid-etch technique. Veneers are a more conservative way of treating discolored teeth than by crowns.
