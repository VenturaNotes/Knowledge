- $n$. the presence of fluid and gas in the peritoneal cavity. This may be due to the introduction of air through an instrument being used to remove the fluid; because of a perforation in the digestive tract that has allowed the escape of fluid and gas; or rarely because gas-forming bacteria are growing in the peritoneal fluid.
