- A form of allopatric speciation in which portions of a preexisting population become separated because of the formation of a geographical barrier between them. For example, the advance of glaciers at the start of each glaciation caused the separation of previously continuous species into isolated refuges, where each subpopulation subsequently diverged. Compare PERIPATRIC SPECIATION.
