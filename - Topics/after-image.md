- $n$. an impression of an image that is registered by the brain for a brief moment after an object is removed from in front of the eye, or after the eye is closed. A positive afterimage, which lasts a few seconds, retains the colour and brightness of the original image; the more common negative afterimage lasts longer and has colours and brightness that are complementary to the original.
