- A subsystem that governs the functions of attached devices but generally does not change the meaning of the data that may pass through it. The attached devices are usually peripherals or communication channels. One of the functions of the controller may involve processing the data stream in order to format it for transmission or recording.

- A controller is a hardware or software component that manages the flow of data between two entities. For instance, video game controllers pass user inputted data, such as flicking the joystick to the right or scrolling the trackball up or down, to the video gaming system to allow users to manipulate the actions of their on-screen video game characters. In computer systems, controllers may come in the form of microchips or external hardware devices that handle the exchange of information between two computer systems.
