## Synthesis
- Extra space or temporary memory that an algorithm uses beyond the input data itself. 
	- Space taken by input not counted
- It is different from space complexity
	- Space complexity is the total memory used by the algorithm, including the input and any auxiliary space
	- Auxiliary space is only the extra or temporary memory used during computation (like recursion stacks, helper arrays, etc.)
	- So the main difference is that space complexity includes the input space while the auxiliary space does not
