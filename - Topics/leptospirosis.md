- (Weil's disease) n. an infectious disease, caused by bacteria of the genus Leptospira (especially L. icterohaemorrhagiae), that occurs in rodents, dogs, and other mammals and may be transmitted to people whose work brings them into contact with these animals. The disease begins with a high fever and headache and may affect the liver (causing jaundice) or kidneys (resulting in renal failure); in some cases patients may go on to develop meningitis.
