- (ureteronephrectomy) $n$. the surgical removal of a kidney together with its ureter. This operation is performed for cancer of the kidney pelvis or ureter. It is also undertaken when the kidney has been destroyed by vesicoureteric reflux, to prevent subsequent continuing reflux into the stump of the ureter that would occur if only the kidney were removed.
