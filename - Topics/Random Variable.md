## Source [^1]
- A quantity that may take any of a prescribed set of values with relative frequency determined by its probability distribution.
## Source[^2]
- A function that maps the outcomes of a random experiment onto the real numbers. For example, one can define a random variable $X$ as taking value 0 when a tossed coin shows 'heads' and value 1 when the coin shows 'tails'. A random variable is characterized by a probability distribution, i.e. the set of all possible values that it can assume and the corresponding probabilities. A random variable is continuous, or has a continuous distribution, if it can take any values from an interval, bounded or unbounded; and it is discrete, or has a discrete distribution, if it can only take a countable, finite or infinite, number of values.
