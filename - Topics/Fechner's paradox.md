- $n$. An increase in the perceived lightness of an image or scene that is viewed first with both eyes, but with an achromatic light-reducing filter over one eye, and then with the other eye alone and without a filter, despite the fact that less light enters the visual system in the second viewing. It arises as a direct consequence of binocular summation, according to which the perceived lightness of an image or scene viewed binocularly is approximately the average of the brightness of the two stimuli perceived monocularly. It is a surprising phenomenon rather than a true paradox. \[Named after the German philosopher, physician, psychologist, and mystic Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-87) who first pointed it out]
