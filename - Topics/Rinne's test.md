- a test to determine whether deafness is conductive or sensorineural. A vibrating tuning fork is held first in the air, close to the ear, and then with its base placed on the bone (mastoid process) behind the ear. If the sound conducted by air is heard louder than the sound conducted by bone the test is positive and the deafness sensorineural; a negative result, when the sound conducted by bone is heard louder, indicates conductive deafness. \[H. A. Rinne (1819-68), German otologist]
