- A local area network (LAN) is a communication network that connects users in a specific area. A single enterprise typically owns and manages a LAN and uses it within a building, such as an office complex or college campus. A LAN performs functions such as transferring data between systems connected to the network. It also sends output to printers and emails to users in the network. A LAN can also access a wider area network (WAN) such as the internet via a direct connection. More LANs use internet standards and protocols nowadays, but firewalls typically protect them from the public internet.
