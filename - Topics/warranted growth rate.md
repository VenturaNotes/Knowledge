- The rate at which growth must occur in a Harrod-Domar model if it is to be sustainable. If national income is $Y$, saving is $S$, and investment is $I$, saving is assumed to be a constant proportion of income so that $S=s Y$. Investment is assumed to be given by an accelerator model, where investment is given by $I=v(d Y / d t)$, where $t$ is time. For ex ante saving and investment to be equal it must be the case that $s Y=v(d Y / d t)$. This implies that the growth rate of $Y$ must be$$w=\left(\frac{1}{Y}\right)\left(\frac{d Y}{d t}\right)=\frac{s}{v}$$This is the only rate at which equilibrium growth is possible, so long as the saving ratio $s$ and the capital-output ratio $v$ are taken as fixed.
