- (1) (of a set S) A finite set of subsets of S whose union is just S itself. The subsets, $A_1, A_2, ..., A_m$, are said to cover S. If the elements $A_i$ for $i = 1, 2,..., m$ are mutually disjoint, then the covering $\{A_1,...A_m\}$ is called a partition of S.
- (2) A relationship between two elements of a partially ordered set S. If x and y are elements of S, then y covers x if and only if $x < y$, and whenever $x \le z \le y$ for some element $z$ in S, then either $x = z$ or $z = y$
