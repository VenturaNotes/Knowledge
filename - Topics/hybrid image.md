- $n$. An image that appears to depict different faces, objects, or scenes from different viewing distances (see illustration). Such an image is constructed by combining one image represented in low spatial frequencies (fine detail) and a different image in high spatial frequencies (broad-brush features). The famously elusive and enigmatic smile in the Mona Lisa painting by the Italian artist and polymath Leonardo da Vinci (1452-1519) was explained in a letter to the journal Science in 2000 by the US neurobiologist Margaret S. Livingstone (born 1950) as a hybrid image. When looked at directly, with the sharp resolution of central vision, the high spatial frequency detail in the area of the Mona Lisa's mouth shows no smile, but when observed in peripheral vision or from a distance, the lower frequency sfumato outline reveals a distinct smile. Compare ambiguous figure, block portrait, Navon figure. \[From hybrid of mixed origin, from Latin hybrida the offspring of a mixed union, first applied to images and stimuli by the Belgian psychologist Philippe G. Schyns (born 1963) and the French psychologist Aude Oliva (born 1968) in an article in the journal Psychological Science in 1994]

	- Hybrid image. When this image (from Aude Oliva, MIT) is viewed from close up, it looks like Albert Einstein; from farther away, it looks like Marilyn Monroe.
