## Source [^1]
- HOOD was developed specifically for the European Space Agency and very closely follows the structure of the Ada programming language. It provides diagram notations to depict nested packages and tasks; it also provides specification of these items in terms of procedures, functions, variables, types, etc. It indicates how higher-level objects are decomposed into lower-level objects and also how the interface of the high-level object is mapped to the interface(s) of lower-level objects.
