- An estimator obtained by minimizing the sum of squared residuals subject to the set of constraints that constitute a hypothesis to be tested. The test of the hypothesis then amounts to establishing whether assuming the hypothesis is true leads to a significant loss of fit, and is based on the comparison of the sums of squared residuals from the restricted and unrestricted regressions.
