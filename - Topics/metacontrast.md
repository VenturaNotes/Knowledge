- $n$. A type of backward masking in which the test stimulus and masking stimulus do not overlap spatially in the visual field. The term is often applied to visual masking by a non-overlapping figure irrespective of the temporal order of test stimulus and masking stimulus, but in careful usage the term paracontrast is used when the test stimulus precedes the masking stimulus. See also masking, visual masking. Compare PARACONTRAST. \[From Greek meta beyond + Latin contra against + stare to stand]
