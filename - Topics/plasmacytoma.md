- $n$. a malignant tumor of plasma cells, often known as a 'solitary myeloma'. Although usually occurring as a single tumor in bone marrow or more rarely soft tissue (extramedullary plasmacytoma), it may be multiple, in which case it is classified as a multiple myeloma. All of these tumors may produce the abnormal gammaglobulins that are characteristic of myeloma, and they may progress to widespread myeloma. The soft-tissue tumors often respond to radiotherapy and to such drugs as thalidomide and cyclophosphamide; the bone tumors are typically less responsive.
