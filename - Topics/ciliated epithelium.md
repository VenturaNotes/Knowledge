- A region of epithelium consisting of columnar or cuboidal cells bearing hairlike appendages (see CILIUM) that are capable of beating rapidly. Ciliated epithelium performs the function of moving particles or fluid over the epithelial surface in such structures as the trachea, bronchial tubes, and nasal cavities. It often occurs in the vicinity of mucus-secreting goblet cells.
