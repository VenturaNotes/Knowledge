## Source [^1]
- Any device, including I/O devices and backing store, that is connected to a computer. The term originated in the mainframe era when all the computing was centralized and the input/output functions were attached around the periphery of the installation. Since the advent of smaller cheaper computers, printers, etc., the term peripheral is seldom used.
