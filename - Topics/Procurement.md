- The procurement process focuses on finding suitable suppliers for a particular business' needs while factoring in reliability and overall cost. The stages of procurement include sourcing, purchasing, and payment. Procurement aims to create and maintain lasting relationships with suppliers while working together to determine and fulfill business needs in a cost-effective way.

- Government purchase of goods and services. The large scale of government purchases makes inefficiency in procurement a potential drain on government finances, and corruption may lead to the misallocation of resources. It is also common for government procurement to favour domestic suppliers over foreign suppliers: unless this is necessary on the grounds of national security, it is a form of protectionism which is an important source of inefficiency.
