- (LSD) an illegal hallucinogenic drug that was formerly used to aid treatment of certain psychological disorders. Side-effects include digestive upsets, dizziness, tingling, anxiety, sweating, dilated pupils, muscle incoordination and tremor. Alterations in sight, hearing, and other senses occur, psychotic effects, depression, and confusion are common, and tolerance to the drug develops rapidly. Because of these toxic effects, LSD is no longer used clinically. See Appendix 12 for a list of street names for illicit drugs.
