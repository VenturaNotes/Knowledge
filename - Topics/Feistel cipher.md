- A type of binary cipher designed in the 1970s by Horst Feistel (of IBM). It is a repetitive mixed cipher. The existence of its inverse (for the purpose of decryption) is assured by the careful use of the exclusive-OR operation within its algorithm. Two important implementations are the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and its precursor Lucifer.
