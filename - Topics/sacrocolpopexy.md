- $n$. surgical treatment of vault prolapse, which can be an abdominal or laparoscopic procedure. It involves suspending the prolapsed vaginal vault to the sacral promontory using a synthetic mesh or biological material; however, it is associated with a significant risk of haemorrhage and mesh erosion. Posterior intravaginal slingplasty (or infracoccygeal sacropexy) is a more recent technique in which a neo-uterosacral ligament (which supports the vagina) is formed. This helps to relocate the vaginal apex and restore the normal vaginal axis. The procedure appears to have similar efficacy to those currently in use but with minimal surgical morbidity.
