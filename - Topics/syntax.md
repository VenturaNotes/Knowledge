## Source [^1]
- Syntax is the rules and patterns that govern how we structure sentences
- The grammatical structures that constitute syntax can be thought of as a hierarchy, with sentences at the top as the largest cohesive unit in the language and words (the parts of speech) at the bottom
- Basic structural units in all sentences
	- Subjects
	- Predicates
- Larger classes of structures
	- Modifiers
	- Phrases
	- Clauses

## Source[^2]
- (syntax rules) The rules defining the legal sequences of symbolic elements in a language. The syntax rules define the form of the various constructs in the language, but say nothing about the meaning of these constructs. Examples of constructs are: expressions, procedures, and programs (in the case of programming languages) and terms, well-formed formulas, and sentences (in the case of logical languages). See also BNF EXTENDED BNF, PARSING.
## Source[^3]
- Syntax refers to the rules that govern the structure of a language. In programming terms, it's essential to understand syntax to write code that is both accurate and easy to read.
