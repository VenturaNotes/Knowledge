- (of a node in a binary tree) A measure of the relative size of the left and right subtrees of the node. Usually, the balance is defined to be the height of the left subtree minus the height of the right subtree (or the absolute value thereof). However, formulas are also used that measure balance in terms of the total number of nodes in the left and right subtrees.
