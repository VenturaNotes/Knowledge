- An interdisciplinary field of study that applies insights from neuroscience and psychology to explain the economic decisions of individuals, which are assumed to have a biological basis. In particular, neuroeconomics seeks to explain decisions that conventional economics cannot account for, such as those that appear irrational or that result in suboptimal outcomes. The field, which has a strong emphasis on experimental observation, has emerged since 2000. See BEHAVIOURAL FINANCE.
