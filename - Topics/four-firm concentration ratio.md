- The combined market share of the four largest firms in a particular industry expressed as a percentage. For example, the combined market share of the four largest UK supermarkets has been calculated at nearly $80 \%$. The four-firm ratio is often held to indicate the form or structure of a market in respect of competition (i.e. whether it takes the form of monopolistic competition, oligopoly, or monopoly). A concentration ratio of over $40 \%$, for example, is usually held to indicate an oligopoly. See also HERFINDAHL INDEX.
