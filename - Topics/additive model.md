- $n$. Any statistical or mathematical model in which an effect can be expressed as a weighted sum of independent variables, so that the portion of the effect contributed by one independent variable does not depend on the value of any other independent variable. A classic example of a linear additive model is multiple regression. See also additivity. Compare MULTIPLICATIVE MODEL.
