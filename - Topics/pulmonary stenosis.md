- congenital narrowing of the outlet of the right ventricle of the heart to the pulmonary artery. The defect may be in the pulmonary valve (valvular stenosis) or in the outflow tract of the right ventricle below the valve (infundibular stenosis). It may be isolated or combined with other heart defects (e.g. tetralogy of Fallot). Severe pulmonary stenosis may produce angina pectoris, faintness, and heart failure. The defect is corrected by surgery.
