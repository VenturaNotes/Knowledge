- An index of overall economic performance, formed by adding the unemployment rate and the inflation rate. The index was first introduced by Arthur Okun in the 1960s and is based on the assumption that both unemployment and inflation lead to economic and social costs for a country. A rise in the index implies a deterioration in economic performance. Robert Barroâ€™s version, proposed in 1999, includes the interest rate and the growth rate of the GDP.

- A measure of economic distress calculated by adding the unemployment rate to the inflation rate at any time. Some versions include additional measures, such as the base rate, annual GDP, and the number of bankruptcies.
