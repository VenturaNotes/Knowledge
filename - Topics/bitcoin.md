- Bitcoin is a form of digital currency designed to function without the oversight of banks or government entities. This popular cryptocurrency operates on a decentralized ledger system (known as a blockchain) that facilitates the transfer of bitcoins from peer to peer, verifies and keeps a record of all bitcoin transactions, and manages the overall supply of available bitcoins. To make a transaction using bitcoin, customers access their bitcoin wallet app and send the virtual currency to a unique signature linked to a company or individual ªs bitcoin wallet.

- A digital currency launched in 2009. The currency units, bitcoins, are used as a medium of exchange and store of value despite not being backed by any bank. They can be bought and sold using most recognized currencies or created from nothing by solving certain mathematical problems using specialized software, a process known as 'bitcoin mining'. Although transactions using bitcoins are recorded in a public ledger, the identities of those exchanging the currency for goods or services are withheld. This has caused questions to be raised about the extent of its use in illegal activities.
