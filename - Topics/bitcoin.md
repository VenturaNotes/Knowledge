- Bitcoin is a form of digital currency designed to function without the oversight of banks or government entities. This popular cryptocurrency operates on a decentralized ledger system (known as a blockchain) that facilitates the transfer of bitcoins from peer to peer, verifies and keeps a record of all bitcoin transactions, and manages the overall supply of available bitcoins. To make a transaction using bitcoin, customers access their bitcoin wallet app and send the virtual currency to a unique signature linked to a company or individual ªs bitcoin wallet.
