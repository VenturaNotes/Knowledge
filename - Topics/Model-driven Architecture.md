- Model-driven architecture or MDA is an infrastructure concept created by the Object Management Group (OMG), a technology standards development organization. Its premise is to base the functionality of business apps or software on standards rather than technical details. The model of the business app should be the primary focus rather than the underlying technology that makes the model work. In theory, this means that the apps can constantly evolve regardless of the underpinning technological platforms.
