- adj. Releasing dopamine; also activated by or responding to dopamine, this extended usage being widespread but consistently rejected by the English physiologist Sir Henry Hallet Dale (1875-1968), who coined the suffix -ergic, and by many other authorities. The term applies especially to nerve fibres, such as those of the mesotelencephalic pathway and the mesolimbic system, that use dopamine as their main or only neurotransmitter. Compare adrenergic, cholinergic, GABAergic, NORADRENERGIC, SEROTONERGIC. \[From dopamine + Greek ergon work + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
