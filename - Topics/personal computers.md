- PC: Most often used to mean an IBM-compatible computer as opposed to other architectures. The abbreviation is sometimes used however to refer to any variety of personal computer, although the unabbreviated form is more common in this context
- Personal Computer: A general-purpose single-user microcomputer designed to be operated by one person at a time (see also PC). Personal computers are now extremely sophisticated machines with powerful processors, large-capacity disk storage, high-resolution color-graphics systems, high-speed network interfaces, and many other options. In scientific, engineering, and business environments the personal computer has superseded the terminal connected to a time-sharing system, especially since communication ports and network connections allow transfers of data between computers as well as client/server computing. The development of the personal computer is a consequence of the continually increasing ratio of computing power to cost, coupled with decreasing weight, size, and power consumption.
