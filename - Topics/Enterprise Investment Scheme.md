- (EIS) An investment scheme in the UK that replaced the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) on 1 January 1994. Its purpose is to help certain types of small higher-risk unlisted trading companies to raise capital. Individuals who invest between $£ 500$ and $£ 1 \mathrm{M}$ in eligible shares in any one year are entitled to a tax relief of $30 \%$ of the amount subscribed. Gains on the sale of shares issued under the scheme are exempt from capital gains tax. Investors may hold paid directorships of the companies concerned. Tax relief of $50 \%$ of an investment of up to $£ 100,000$ made between 6 April 2012 and 6 April 2017 is also available under the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme. See also Corporate Venturing Scheme; venture capital trust.
