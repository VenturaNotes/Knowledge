## Source[^2]
- An autonomous system (AS) in networking is a collection of one or more associated Internet Protocol (IP) prefixes with a clearly defined routing policy that governs how the AS exchanges routing information with other autonomous systems.
## Source[^3]
- On the Internet, a network or group of networks that can be viewed by the rest of the Internet as a single system for routing purposes. Autonomous systems must be registered and allocated a unique [[AS number]] by IANA, and their routers must communicate with each other using the Border Gateway Protocol. Autonomous systems are usually run by large organizations, in particular Internet Service Providers.
