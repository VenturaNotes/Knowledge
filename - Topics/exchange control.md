- Restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign exchange. This has taken various forms in different countries, in particular those who experience shortages of hard currencies; sometimes different regulations apply to transactions that would come under the capital account of the balance of payments. Recent decades have seen a general movement toward dismantling exchange controls by developed countries. The UK abolished all forms of exchange control in 1979.

- A system under which holders of a national currency require official permission or approval to convert it into other currencies. Exchange control may apply to all holders of a currency, or some holders, usually non-residents, may be exempt. Where non-residents are allowed convertibility, exchange control may be applied to transfers from resident to non-resident domestic currency bank accounts. Exchange controls may have varying degrees of strictness; frequently they are much more stringent on obtaining foreign currency for capital account than for current account purposes.
