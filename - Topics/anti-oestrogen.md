- (oestrogen-receptor antagonist) $n$. one of a group of drugs that oppose the action of oestrogen by binding to oestrogen receptors in the body's tissues. The most important of these drugs is currently tamoxifen, which is used in the treatment of breast cancers dependent on oestrogen. Because they stimulate the production of pituitary gonadotrophins, some anti-oestrogens (e.g. clomifene, tamoxifen) are used to induce or stimulate ovulation in infertility treatment. Side-effects of anti-oestrogens include hot flushes, itching of the vulva, nausea, vomiting, fluid retention, and sometimes vaginal bleeding.
