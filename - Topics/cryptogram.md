- A cryptogram is a word puzzle that can be decrypted to reveal a secret message. Cryptograms are often encoded using ciphers, a writing system meant to disguise the real meaning of a series of text. Most cryptograms can be solved by hand, without the help of a computer program. Today, cryptograms are also used for entertainment purposes and are often printed in the newspaper or on digital media outlets for readers to decipher. Cryptograms are also used to secure credit and debit card transactions. Any time an employee uses a company card to make a purchase they typically will insert the Eurocard, Mastercard, or Visa (EMV) chip on their card into a card reader. The EMV chip on their card stores cryptogram technology that creates a one-time code for every transaction made. This code is used to validate transactions, proving the authenticity of the bank card.
