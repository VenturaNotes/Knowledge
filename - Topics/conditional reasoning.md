- $n$. A form of logical reasoning based on conditional statements or conditional propositions having the form If $p$, then $q$, in which $p$ is the antecedent and $q$ is the consequent. An example is If this substance is glass, then a diamond will scratch it. The conditional statement is logically equivalent to Not-( $p$ and not-q), and it is true, by definition, if and only if $p$ and $q$ are both true or $p$ is false (whether $q$ is true or false). A subjunctive conditional is a conditional statement or proposition (1) in which the antecedent and consequent are both hypothetical or contingent: If the polar ice cap were to melt, then many people would drown. A counterfactual conditional is a subjunctive conditional in which the antecedent is not merely hypothetical but false: If she had pulled the trigger, then I would have been killed; and in logic it is necessarily true because its antecedent is false. See also affirming the ANTECEDENT, AFFIRMING THE CONSEQUENT, BICONDITIONAL, DENYING THE ANTECEDENT, DENYING THE CONSEQUENT, SIMULATION HEURISTIC.
