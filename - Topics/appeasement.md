- Behavior that inhibits aggression from another animal of the same species, frequently taking the form of a special posture or display emphasizing the weakness of the performer. Threatening structures (e.g. antlers) and markings are covered or turned away, and vulnerable parts of the body may be exposed. Appeasement is seen in courtship, in greeting ceremonies, and often (from the loser) after a fight.
