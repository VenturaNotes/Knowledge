- (software library) A collection of programs and packages that are made available for common use within some environment; individual items need not be related. A typical library might contain compilers, utility programs, packages for mathematical operations, etc. Usually it is only necessary to reference the library program to cause it to be automatically incorporated in a user's program. See also DLL.
