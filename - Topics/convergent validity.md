- $n$. A form of validity that, together with discriminant validity, provides evidence of construct validity. It is based on the assumption that different measures of the same hypothetical construct ought to correlate highly with one another if the measures are valid. The concept was introduced in an article by the US psychologists Donald T(homas) Campbell (1916-96) and Donald W(inslow) Fiske (1916-2003) in the journal Psychological Bulletin in 1959. See also multi—Çrait-MULTIMETHOD MATRIX.
