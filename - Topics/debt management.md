- The management of the debt of a company or government to keep down its expected cost and ensure that funds are always available when needed. This includes forecasting when net borrowing will be needed, choosing the type of securities to be issued or redeemed, and timing the maturity dates of outstanding debt to prevent excessive concentration of redemption payments at particular dates, which might give rise to difficulties in funding them.
