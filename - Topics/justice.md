- $n$. the moral requirement to treat people fairly and impartially and with a proper regard for their entitlements and deserts - although the ways in which ethicists and philosophers define fairness, entitlements, and deserts varies considerably.

Issues of justice are mainly, but not exclusively, concerned with the fair allocation of medical resources when these are limited, and can be encapsulated in theories of distributive justice (see DESERT; EQUALITY; NEED; RATIONING).
