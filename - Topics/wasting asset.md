- An asset that has a finite life; for example, a lease may lose value throughout its life and become valueless when it terminates. It is also applied to such assets as plant and machinery, which wear out during their life and therefore lose value.
## Source[^2]
- An asset which diminishes over time. This wastage may be due to gradual destruction through use, for example the depletion of ore reserves by mining them. Alternatively, it may be due to the passage of time: for example, a patent will expire on some future date, which draws closer as time passes.
