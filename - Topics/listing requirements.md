- The conditions that must be satisfied before a security can be traded on a stock exchange. To achieve a quotation in the Official List of Securities of the main market of the London Stock Exchange, the requirements contained in a listing agreement must be signed by the company seeking quotation. The two main requirements of such a listing are usually:
	- that the value of the company's assets should exceed a certain value;
	- that the company publish specific financial and operating information, both at the time of flotation and regularly thereafter.
- Listing requirements are generally more stringent the larger the market. For example, the main market in London demands considerably more information from companies than the Alternative Investment Market. The listing requirements are set out in the Yellow Book.
