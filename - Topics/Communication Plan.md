- A communication plan is a comprehensive outline of who should receive certain information, when that information should be delivered, and what communication channels should be used to deliver the information. Businesses often utilize a communication plan to detail the various channels, templates, and schedules that teams are required to use to communicate with key project stakeholders. A typical communication plan should include established goals, key audiences and messaging, outreach details, and a proposed deadline.
