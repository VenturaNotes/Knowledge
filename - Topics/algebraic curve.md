- A planar algebraic curve is one that can be represented by a polynomial equation in two variables. The degree of the curve is the degree of the polynomial. Such a curve defined over the rational numbers might consist of a finite number of points, whilst a complex algebraic curve (see COMPLEX NUMBER) is a Riemann surface.
