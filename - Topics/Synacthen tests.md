- tests used to assess the ability of the adrenal cortex to produce cortisol. Serum cortisol is measured before and then 30 minutes (or 5 hours) after an intramuscular injection of $250 ~\mu \mathrm{g}$ (or 1 mg ) tetracosactide (Synacthen), an analogue of ACTH. The adrenal glands are considered to be inadequate if there is a low baseline concentration of cortisol or the rise is less than a certain predefined amount.
