- The local electrical charge that develops in the sensitive part of a receptor cell, known as the generator region. The generator potential is caused by depolarization of the membrane surrounding this part of the cell, brought about by an exchange of ions in response to a stimulus. The strength of the potential is proportional to the strength of the stimulus: when the potential exceeds a certain threshold, it fires an action potential. More action potentials are triggered as long as the generator potential exists.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A graded change in the voltage difference across the membrane of a sensory receptor that results from an appropriate stimulus and that tends either to excite or to inhibit an action potential in the associated sensory neuron. Also called receptor potential.
