- (heliotropism) The growth of plant organs in response to light. Aerial shoots usually grow towards light, while some aerial roots grow away from light. The phototropic response is triggered by photosensitive molecules, such as phototropins, and brought about by the differential distribution of the plant hormone auxin in the illuminated part, which in turn causes differential growth of the shoot or root. See TROPISM.
