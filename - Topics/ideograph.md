- $n$. A character or symbol used in a system of writing to represent directly a concept, idea, or object rather than a word or a sound. Characters in the writing systems of China and Japan are often called ideographs, but because the characters actually represent linguistic units rather than concepts they are therefore more properly called logographs. Also called an ideogram. See also KANJI. Compare LOGOGRAPH, PICTOGRAPH. ideographic adj. Of or relating to ideographs, not to be confused with idiographic. \[From Greek idea idea + graphein to write]
