- Decreasing net assets by spending in excess of income. This may be done either by spending money taken from bank balances or the proceeds of selling assets, or by incurring debts. People with positive net assets can dissave relatively easily: even if their assets are not very liquid, they can usually be used as collateral for loans. Individuals with negative net assets find dissaving difficult; lending to them is increasingly risky as their net asset position worsens.
