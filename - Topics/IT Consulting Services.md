- IT consulting services involve bringing in outside assistance to help businesses determine their technological and overall process needs. An IT consulting service can help businesses decide what IT and network equipment to buy now and what they may need in the future, along with helping them implement network infrastructure in alignment with their business goals. They may also be on-call to provide technical support if something breaks.
