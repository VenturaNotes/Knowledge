- (functional cohesion) A measure of the degree to which parts of a program module are closely functionally related. High cohesion means that each part is directed toward and essential for that module to perform its required function, and that the module performs only that function. Low cohesion might be due to convenience grouping of functions that are unrelated by function, timing, logic, procedure, or by sequence.
- [[Temporal cohesion]] occurs where a module contains several functions that must be performed at the same time, but are not closely related by function.
- [[Logical cohesion]] is where several logically related functions are placed in the same module. For example a unit may handle all input to a program irrespective of its source being from disk, communications port, keyboard, etc.
- [[Procedural cohesion]] is where functions that must be performed in a certain order are grouped together in the same module.
- [[Sequential cohesion]] occurs when the output from one part of a module is the input to the next part, but if the module is not constructed for functional cohesion it is possible that not all the related parts will occur in the one module.
- High functional cohesion might be seen as one characteristic of good design. See also COUPLING.

- (1) The force of attraction between like molecules. The hydrogen bonds between water molecules provide the cohesive force that holds up a column of water in the xylem tissue of plants without it breaking. The cohesion-tension theory is the most widely accepted explanation for the continual flow of water upwards through the xylem of a plant. Water is removed from the plant by the process of transpiration, which creates a tension that pulls the water in the xylem upwards as a single column held together by cohesive forces. Also, adhesion between water molecules and the walls of the xylem counteracts the downward gravitational force. 
- (2) (in botany) The union of like parts, such as the fusion of petals that occurs in some flowers.
