- A touch receptor, occurring in the outer layer (epidermis) of hairless skin, that responds to sustained light pressure. Named after German anatomist Friedrich S. Merkel (1845-1919), these discs are found in large numbers in the fingertips, lips, and genitalia, where they are important in discriminating textures and shapes. Each consists of a sensory Merkel cell and associated sensory nerve ending, which conveys impulses to a sensory nerve.
