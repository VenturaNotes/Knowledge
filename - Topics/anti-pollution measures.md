- Policies to reduce or eliminate pollution. These include taxation, quantitative restriction, or prohibition of activities causing pollution; zoning regulations to locate polluting activities where they will do the least harm; and support for research into the effects of pollution and the discovery of methods of production with fewer harmful by-products. Education of industrial firms and the general public can both increase voluntary avoidance of pollution, and generate political support for compulsory methods of reducing it, either by taxation or by controls. Incentives to avoid pollution can also be given by imposing legal liabilities on polluters either to compensate particular victims, or to pay for the general costs of cleaning-up operations.
