- A budget deficit occurs when government expenses exceed [[revenue]]
## Source[^2]
- The excess of a government's total expenditure over its income. This has to be met by borrowing, which increases government debt. Budget deficits can be calculated for any level of government-central, local, state in federal countries such as Germany or the United States-or for general government, which is all these levels combined. It is important to distinguish whether the deficit is calculated including as expenditure the nominal or the real interest on government debt: conventional measures of the budget deficit use nominal interest, but an inflation-adjusted budget deficit would include real interest only. The cyclically adjusted budget deficit is what the budget deficit would be if the existing tax and spending rules were maintained but national income rose or fell to its normal level; this can only be estimated.

- An excess of government expenditure over government income, which must be financed either by borrowing or by printing money. Keynesians have advocated that governments should run budget deficits during recessions in order to stimulate aggregate demand. Monetarists and new classical macroeconomists, however, argue that budget deficits simply stimulate inflation and crowd out private investment. Most economists now agree that, at least on average, governments should seek a balanced budget and that persistent deficits should be eliminated, either by reducing expenditure or increasing taxation. In some cases a budget surplus can be used during a boom to collect more revenue than is being spent. In the UK the budget deficit is now officially known as the Public Sector Net Cash Requirement.
