- a small mass of tissue in the carotid sinus containing chemoreceptors that monitor levels of oxygen, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen ions in the blood. If the oxygen level falls, the chemoreceptors send impulses to the cardiac and respiratory centres in the brain, which promote increases in heart and respiration rates. It can give rise to carotid body tumours, which are a form of paraganglioma.
## Source[^2]
- One of a pair of tissue masses adjacent to the carotid sinus. Each contains receptors that are sensitive to oxygen and pH levels (acidity) in the blood. High levels of carbon dioxide in the blood lower the pH (i.e. increase the acidity). By responding to fluctuations in pH , the carotid body coordinates reflex changes in respiration rate. See also VENTILATION CENTRE.
