- (anticholinergic) adj. inhibiting the action of acetylcholine, the neurotransmitter that conveys information in the parasympathetic nervous system. Antimuscarinic drugs block the effects of certain (muscarinic) receptors (hence their name). The actions of these drugs include relaxation of smooth muscle, decreased secretion of saliva, sweat, and digestive juices, and dilation of the pupil of the eye. Atropine and similar drugs have these effects; they are used in the treatment of gut spasms (e.g. propantheline) and of parkinsonism (e.g. trihexyphenidyl) as bronchodilators (e.g. ipratropium), and as mydriatics. Characteristic sideeffects include dry mouth, thirst, blurred vision, dry skin, increased heart rate, and difficulty in urination.
