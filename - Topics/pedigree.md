- A family tree depicting the number, gender, matings, and other traits of parents and their offspring in consecutive generations. In human clinical genetics a pedigree can provide valuable information about the inheritance of certain diseases, such as whether the abnormal allele is dominant or recessive, and the probability that future offspring will also have the disease. Pedigrees are also important in breeding elite livestock, such as dogs or horses, particularly to identify potentially favorable matings.
