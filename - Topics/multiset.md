## Synthesis
- Multisets are also known as bags
	- #question Are multisets really known as bags?
- Multisets allow duplicates
- Order does not matter
	- $\{1, 2\} = \{2,1\}$ 
- Mutable (in most implementations)
- Use case: Counting repeated elements
	- #question I would like an example of this
- Multisets are allowed, but position-agnostic
- Can use `collections.Counter` as a multiset substitute 
- Functionally
	- A multiset is like a shopping list: you care about how many of each item, but not the order
