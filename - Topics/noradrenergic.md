- adj. Releasing noradrenalin (norepinephrine); also activated by or responding to noradrenalin, this extended usage being widespread but consistently rejected by the English physiologist Sir Henry Hallet Dale (1875-1968), who coined the suffix -ergic, and by many other authorities. The term applies especially to nerve fibers such as those of the sympathetic nervous system or the locus coeruleus and many other areas in the central nervous system that use noradrenalin as their neurotransmitter. Compare ADRENERGIC, CHOLINERGIC, DOPAMINERGIC, GABAergic, serotonergic. \[From noradrenalin + Greek ergon work + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
