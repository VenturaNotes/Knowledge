- (Ogilvie's syndrome) $n$. functional impairment of intestinal peristalsis without evidence of an obstructing lesion (acute colonic pseudo-obstruction). It presents with vomiting, marked abdominal distension, and constipation. It commonly occurs in hospitalized patients with serious illness, probably caused by abnormalities in colonic autonomic regulation and often associated with trauma, sepsis, the postoperative state following abdominal, pelvic, or orthopaedic surgery, or cardiac dysfunction (heart failure, myocardial infarction). Management is usually conservative and involves treatment of the underlying condition, the 'drip and suck' approach (see ILEUS), decompression of the colon, and prokinetic agents (such as neostigmine). Surgery is required when the conservative approach fails or in cases of perforation.
