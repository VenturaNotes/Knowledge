- HIS references the technology applications that focus primarily on the administration and management of hospital operations. It helps provide both internal and external communication between healthcare providers. Comprehensive information relating to patients’ health history, doctors’ schedules, etc. need to be securely stored to be accessed by the right people when needed. Using HIS, healthcare providers can source macro data like community health trends as needed. It can help enhance quality of care, medical outcomes, and overall quality of life, while reducing medical errors, deaths, and costs.
