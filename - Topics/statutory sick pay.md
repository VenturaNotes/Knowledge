- (SSP) A compulsory scheme operated by an employer. Payments are made to an employee for up to 28 weeks of absence as a result of sickness. There are two rates of statutory sick pay, the applicable level being determined by the employee's earnings. The two qualifying conditions for SSP are:
	- there must be a period of incapacity for work;
	- there must be one or more qualifying days.
- The first three days do not count and so it is only on the fourth consecutive day that an entitlement to SSP begins.

- benefit payable to employees who are unable to work because of illness.
