- Digital commerce is the buying and selling of goods and services through an interactive and self-service experience. This means that customers select products and servicesÂ themselves. There is little human interaction during this process because of automation. Customers don't engage with cashiers like they would at a brick-and-mortar store, for example. Digital commerce happens via technologies such as the internet and mobile networks. Retailers and service providers might use various techniques to make digital commerce a more successful experience. These techniques include analytics, promotion, pricing, and customer acquisition.
