- The intervention of a neutral third party in an industrial dispute. The object is to enable the two sides to reach a compromise solution to their differences, which the mediator usually does by seeing representatives of each side separately and then together. If the mediator has power to make binding awards the process is known as arbitration; if the mediator can only suggest means of settling the dispute it is known as conciliation. See Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service.
