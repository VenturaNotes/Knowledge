- $n$. an antiviral drug that acts by inhibiting the action of neuraminidase in viruses. This enzyme destroys the receptor sites on the surface of the host cells. Zanamivir is used for the treatment and prevention of influenza A and B. To be effective, the drug must be taken within 48 hours of the onset of symptoms (for treatment) or within 36 hours of exposure (for prevention). It is liable to cause tightening of the bronchial tubes and this may be dangerous in people with asthma.
