- The overall cost of raising extra finance. For example, if extra debt is incurred, this increases the risk to equity and debt funders, who will in turn demand a higher rate of return on their investment. The concept is also applied to funding raised to implement specific decisions, and should reflect the risks involved in the activity. See COST OF CAPITAL.
