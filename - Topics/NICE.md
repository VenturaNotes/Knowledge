- (National Institute for Health and Care Excellence) a nondepartmental public body that provides national guidance and advice to improve health and social care. NICE was originally set up in 1999 as the National Institute for Clinical Excellence, a special health authority, to reduce variation in the availability and quality of NHS treatments and care. In 2005, after merging with the Health Development Agency, it began developing public health guidance to help prevent ill health and promote healthier lifestyles and the name changed to the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. In April 2013 NICE was established in primary legislation, placing it on a statutory footing as set out in the Health and Social Care Act 2012. At this time it took on responsibility for developing guidance and quality standards in social care, and the name changed once more to reflect these new responsibilities.
