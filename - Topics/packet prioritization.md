## Synthesis
- Packets are prioritized by assigning them different priority levels based on factors like application type, source/destination address, and time sensitivity, which are typically identified through information in the packet header. 
	- This allows network devices like routers to send high-priority packets ahead of lower priority ones, ensuring critical data gets delivered faster, especially when [[network congestion]] occurs. 
		- This process is often managed through a feature called [[Quality of Service|QoS]] which uses queuing mechanisms to differentiate and prioritize traffic based on its assigned priority level
