- A contract of employment in which an employee is not guaranteed any fixed working hours; the employer is not obliged to offer a minimum amount of work and the employee is paid only for the time he or she actually works. Such contracts were formerly associated with industries in which labour is required at short notice, such as catering, but have now spread to many other areas. Concerns have been raised about the uncertainty of income and lack of employment rights provided to workers by such contracts, particularly those that allow employers to offer shifts entirely at their discretion but oblige employees to take whatever work is offered.
