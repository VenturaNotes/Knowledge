- The large-scale management of an ecosystem to reinstate natural processes and reduce human intervention so that ultimately 'nature can take care of itself'. It typically involves reintroduction of indigenous species that previously filled key ecological roles in maintaining the historical 'wild' landscape or seascape. Coupled with this is a return to more natural patterns of drainage and less intensive farming. For example, the Rewilding Europe programme focuses initially on rewilding nine areas of Europe, with reintroduction of species such as the European bison, wild horse, wolf, beaver, and tauros (a modern version of the extinct aurochs; see DE-EXTINCTION).
