- 1. (relative product) A method of combining functions in a serial manner. The composition of two functions

  

$$

f: X \rightarrow Y \text { and } g: Y \rightarrow Z

$$

  

is the function

  

$$

h: X \rightarrow Z

$$

  

with the property that

  

$$

h(x)=g(f(x))

$$

  

This is usually written as $g^{\circ} f$. The process of performing composition is an operation between functions of suitable kinds. It is associative, and identity functions fulfil the role of units.

  

If $R$ denotes the set of real numbers and

  

$$

\begin{aligned}

& f: R \rightarrow R, f(x)=\operatorname{sim}(x) \\

& g: R \rightarrow R, g(x)=x^{2}+\overline{3}

\end{aligned}

$$

  

then $f^{\circ} g$ is the function $h$ :

  

$$

h: R \rightarrow R, h(x)=\operatorname{sim}\left(x^{2}+\overline{3}\right)

$$

  

The idea of composition of functions can be extended to functions of several variables. 2. A subdivision of a positive integer $n$ into parts $a_{1}, a_{2}, \ldots a_{\mathrm{k}}$ in which the ordering is significant and in which

  

$$

n \equiv a_{1}+a_{2}+\ldots+a_{k}

$$

  

where each $a_{i}$ is a positive integer. It is thus similar to a partition (see COVERING) but in a partition the ordering is not significant. In general the number of compositions of $n$ is $2^{n-1}$. 3. A particular form of association between entities found in object-oriented approaches. The association is used to indicate a hierarchy of objects such that objects lower in the hierarchy are part of objects higher in the hierarchy. Thus the hierarchy indicates a component structure.
