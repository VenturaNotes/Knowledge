- $n$. Reasoning from premises to conclusions; or a conclusion arrived at by this process. When the premises are particular observations and the conclusion a general law or principle, then the mode of inference is called induction (1); when the premises are axioms, postulates, or assumptions and the conclusion a logical inference or theorem, then the mode of inference is called deduction. infer $v b$. To make inferences. This word is sometimes used as a synonym for imply (as in Her replies inferred that she disagreed), but this is avoided in careful usage. \[From Latin inferre to bring in, bring about, or deduce, from in- into + ferre to bear or carry]
