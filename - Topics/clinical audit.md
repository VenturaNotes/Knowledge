- a quality-improvement process that seeks to improve patient care and outcomes through systematic review. Aspects of the structure, processes, and outcomes of care are selected and systematically evaluated against explicit criteria. Where indicated, changes are implemented at an individual, team, or service level and further monitoring is used to confirm improvement in health-care delivery. The assessment, evaluation, and improvement of quality then forms a cycle of activity (audit cycle) that promotes sustained improvement (see diagram).
