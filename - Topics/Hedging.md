- Hedging is an investment strategy, and it helps people identify the risks of investing. When someone hedges, they try to reduce potential losses from an investment. They can do this by offsetting. That means investing in another investment to balance out their original investment. Say someone buys stocks in a software company. That person might hedge this investment by also betting against it. In this scenario, the investor can make a profit, even if stock prices for the software company go down. Hedging is a common risk management strategy. However, sometimes this strategy reduces potential profits, because the investor is essentially betting against their original investment.
