- Cost and Freight (CFR) An Incoterm denoting an export contract in which the seller pays the cost of shipping the goods to the port of destination; if the seller also pays costs of marine insurance it is known as a Cost, Insurance and Freight (CIF) contract. In either case, risk passes to the buyer once the goods have crossed the ship's rail at the port of shipment. A Carriage Paid To (CPT) or Carriage and Insurance Paid To (CIP) contract is made on exactly the same terms except that the seller's responsibilities end when the goods are handed over at a named destination (not necessarily a port); it can therefore be used with any mode of transport, or combination of modes. Compare Delivered Ex Ship.
