- $n$. one of a number of pigments derived from porphin, which are widely distributed in living things. All porphyrins form chelates with iron, magnesium, zinc, nickel, copper, and cobalt. These chelates are constituents of haemoglobin, myoglobin, the cytochromes, and chlorophyll, and are thus important in many oxidation/reduction reactions in all living organisms. See also PROTOPORPHYRIN IX.
