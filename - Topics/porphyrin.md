## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. one of a number of pigments derived from porphin, which are widely distributed in living things. All porphyrins form chelates with iron, magnesium, zinc, nickel, copper, and cobalt. These chelates are constituents of haemoglobin, myoglobin, the cytochromes, and chlorophyll, and are thus important in many oxidation/reduction reactions in all living organisms. See also PROTOPORPHYRIN IX.
## Source[^2]
- Any of a group of organic pigments characterized by the possession of a cyclic group of four linked nitrogen-containing rings (a tetrapyrrole nucleus), the nitrogen atoms of which are often coordinated to metal ions. Porphyrins differ in the nature of their sidechain groups. They include the chlorophylls, which contain magnesium; and haem, which contains iron and forms the prosthetic group of haemoglobin, myoglobin, and the cytochromes.

Porphyrins are also used in host-guest chemistry. See supramolecular chemistry.
