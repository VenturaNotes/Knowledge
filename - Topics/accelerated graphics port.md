- A port specification that facilitates the high-speed high-resolution display of graphics. Developed by Intel, it provides a direct connection for data transfer between an AGP-compatible display adapter and the system's main memory. As a result, images are displayed more quickly and smoothly than is otherwise possible over a system's PCI bus. The AGP standard has been superseded by PCI Express.
