- Given the equations:
	- $x_1 + x_2 = 5$ 
	- $3x_1 - 2x_2 = 10$
- The augmented matrix is:
	- $\left[\begin{array}{rr|r} 1 & 1 & 5 \\ 3 & -2 & 10 \\ \end{array}\right]$
		- Has both the coefficients and solution set
		- Has a divider or solid line (although textbook may not have a divider)

	- This is an augmented matrix where the first three columns are the coefficients and the 4th column is the solution set.
	- There is no solid line that shows the distinction, but the above is a valid representation
