- A project planning, management, and scheduling method that divides a project into activities, each with a statement of time and resources required, and their precedence dependencies. These activities are then connected in a graph that expresses the dependencies and the times. The critical path is defined as the path through the graph that requires the maximum time. Variations of this method allow for statistically distributed time and resources, time/resource tradeoffs, etc. See also PERT.
