- Net price is the exact price paid for a product or service. Unlike list prices, net prices account for taxes, fees, and discounts. To calculate the net price of their offerings, businesses first start with the list price (the value that they paid to buy a product or service from a distributor, wholesaler, or retailer). The business then adds any applicable taxes or fees and subtracts any discounts or rebates from the list price to get the net price of a product or service offering. Net prices help businesses determine a pricing strategy that allows them to offer competitive pricing while turning a profit.

- The price a buyer pays for goods or services after all discounts have been deducted.
