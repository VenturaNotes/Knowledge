- (Third-generation Partnership Project) 3GPP is a partnership between seven telecommunications standard development organizations (ARIB, ATIS, CCSA, ETSI, TSDSI, TTC and TTA), also known as "Organizational Partners." It was initially formed by the European Telecommunications Standards Institute to provide industry-standard specifications for 3G mobile and cellular communications. As most businesses are shifting towards 5G technologies, 3GPP has paved the way for upgraded security standards that today's 5G technology utilizes.
