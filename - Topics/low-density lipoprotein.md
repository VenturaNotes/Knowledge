- (LDL) a lipoprotein that is the principal form in which cholesterol is transported in the bloodstream: it accounts for approximately $70 \%$ of the circulating cholesterol in an individual. LDL is derived from very low-density lipoprotein and is eventually cleared from the circulation by the liver. LDL may be deposited within the lining of arteries, thus causing atheroma; the higher the circulating concentration of LDL, the higher the likelihood of atheroma developing (see also HYPERCHOLESTEROLAEMIA). Statins are effective in lowering circulating LDL levels.
