The term is also often used to refer to page printers of this type that use LEDs or LCDs as the active element. This type of printer is now very widely used as an office printer, frequently shared among a number of users. Most laser printers use single sheets of paper or transparent media and provide media-handling facilities; some can handle 50 pages per minute. Laser printers produce a very high standard of print. The higher-end range of laser printers now offers resolutions of 1200 dots per inch. Color laser printers are also available.
