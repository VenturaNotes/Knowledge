- $n$. The act or process of eluding or evading. In psychoanalysis, a term first used by the Scottish psychiatrist Ronald D(avid) Laing (1927-89) in his book The Self and Others (1961) to denote a mechanism whereby people avoid confrontation with themselves and others by self-impersonation, that is, by deliberately playing out the roles that are assigned to them. Laing cited Madame Bovary (1857) by the French novelist Gustave Flaubert (1821-80) as an example of this mechanism.
