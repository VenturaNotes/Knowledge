- $n$. a diagram showing the distribution of radioactive tracer in a part of the body, produced by recording the flashes of light given off by a scintillator as it is struck by radiation of different intensities. This technique is called scintigraphy. By scanning the body, section by section, a 'map' of the radioactivity in various regions is built up, aiding the diagnosis of cancer or other disorders. Such a record is known as a scintiscan. These images are now usually obtained using a gamma camera.
