- A statistical technique in which, given a data set with $n$ observations, the analysis is recalculated $n$ times omitting each observation in turn (removed with a 'jackknife'). The mean and variance of the estimated parameters in the model may be compared with those obtained from the full set. The method is related to statistical bootstrap estimation.
