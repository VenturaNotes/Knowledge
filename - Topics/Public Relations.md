- Public relations is a strategic communication tactic that focuses on establishing a positive relationship between an organization and the public. Oftentimes, public relations professionals are part of an agency. These agencies achieve media coverage by proposing pitches to journalists and gaining spotlight in industry news for its clients. Stories appear on websites, newspapers, magazines, and other informational outlets and are referred to as “earned” media. This term is used since public relations professionals organically generate attention to a brand. Public relations is essential to business since positive coverage in the media boosts the image of an organization. Tactics like public relations play an important role in a businesses marketing strategy as it helps shape the relationships with its existing and potential customers.

- ($\mathbf{P R}$) Influencing the public so that they regard an individual, firm, charity, etc., in a favorable light in comparison to their competitors. In business a good corporate image is an important asset. Some media personalities, large companies, and national charities employ their own public relations officers (PROs) to deal with the media, provide information in the form of handouts, and to represent their principals at press conferences, etc. Others use public relations agencies to fulfil these functions. PR does not involve paid advertising, which is a quite separate activity. While an advertising agent will plan an advertising campaign, charging a percentage of the money spent, PR agencies, for a flat fee (plus expenses), will seek to promote their principals by persuading newspapers to feature them in articles, by obtaining publicity for their products, by arranging for TV and radio personalities to interview them, and by lobbying. PR agencies also handle unfavorable reports and rumors.
