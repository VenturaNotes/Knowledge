- (1) A programming technique used in some code generators in which the 'code' consists of a sequence of entry points of routines. The threaded code is interpreted by executing an unconditional branch to the destination indicated by a word of the code; on completion the routine thus activated terminates by again executing an unconditional branch to the entry point indicated by the next code word. See also MULTITHREADING, SINGLE THREADING. 
- (2) A concurrent programming technique used where an operating system process permits concurrent threads of execution, i.e. sequences of actions that share the process context and can be scheduled by the operating system.
