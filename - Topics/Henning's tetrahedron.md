- $n$. A classification of tastes in terms of a pyramid with a triangular base, its corners representing the fundamental or primary tastes, namely sweet (like sugar or aspartame), sour (like vinegar or lemon juice), salty (like sea water or table salt), and bitter (like quinine or orange peel), and points elsewhere representing other tastes, assumed to be blends of the four primaries. Also called the taste tetrahedron. See also umami. \[Named after the German psychologist Hans Henning (1885-1946) who published it in 1927]
