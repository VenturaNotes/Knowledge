- $n$. the larvae of certain tapeworms, including species of Diphyllobothrium and Spirometra, which may infect humans (see SPARGANOSIS). They are actually plerocercoids, but the generic name Sparganum is sometimes given to them since they fail to develop into adults and definite classification of the species is not possible from the larvae alone.
