- (pronounced pixelblit) (pixel block transfer) An operation that can rapidly change the contents of a pixmap and thus the shade or color of the displayed image. Pixelblt is similar to bitblt but a number of bits representing a greyscale or color are used in the operation, rather than a single bit.
