- The practice by which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) makes its loans conditional on the borrowing country adopting an approved adjustment programme or policy package. Conditionality is justified by the argument that the IMF has limited total resources, and that there is no point in using them in cases when a country's trade or macroeconomic policies make it unlikely that their balance-of-payments problems can be solved even with an IMF loan.
## Source[^2]
- The terms under which the International Monetary Fund (IMF) provides balance-of-payments support to member states. The principle is that support will only be given on the condition that it is accompanied by steps to solve the underlying problem. Programmes of economic reform are agreed with the member; these emphasize the attainment of a sustainable balance-of-payments position and boosting the supply side of the economy. Lending by commercial banks is frequently linked to IMF conditionality.
