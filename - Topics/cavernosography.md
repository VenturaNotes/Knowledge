- $n$. a radiological examination of the erectile tissue of the penis (see CORPUS CAVERNOSUM) that entails the infusion of radiopaque contrast medium into the corpora cavernosa via a small butterfly needle. The contrast medium flow rate needed to maintain erection can be measured, and radiographs taken during the procedure give information regarding any abnormality of the veins draining the penis. It is mostly used in the evaluation of erectile dysfunction. Cavernosography can also be carried out with ultrasound and ultrasound contrast medium.
