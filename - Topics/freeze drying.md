## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- a method for the fixation of histological specimens, involving a minimum of chemical and physical change. Specimens are immersed in isopentane cooled to $-190^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in liquid air. This fixes the tissue instantly, without the formation of large ice crystals (which would cause structural changes). The tissue is then dehydrated in a vacuum for about 72 hours at $-32.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
## Source[^2]
- (lyophilization) The removal of liquid from heat-sensitive materials. The material is frozen, placed under a high vacuum, and maintained at a low temperature $\left(-40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right.$ or below). The pressure generated by the vacuum causes the ice to turn from a solid to a gaseous form without passing through a liquid state. This allows the removal of water from the material without otherwise disturbing its composition. Freeze drying is used to preserve tissues (e.g. blood plasma) and foods and to concentrate solutions.
