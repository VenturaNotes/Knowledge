## Source [^1]
- a method for the fixation of histological specimens, involving a minimum of chemical and physical change. Specimens are immersed in isopentane cooled to $-190^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in liquid air. This fixes the tissue instantly, without the formation of large ice crystals (which would cause structural changes). The tissue is then dehydrated in a vacuum for about 72 hours at $-32.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$.
