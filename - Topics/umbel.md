- A type of racemose inflorescence in which stalked flowers arise from the same point on the flower axis, resembling the spokes of an umbrella. An involucre (cluster) of bracts may occur at the point where the stalks emerge. This arrangement is characteristic of the family Umbelliferae (Apiaceae; e.g. carrot, hogweed, parsley, parsnip), in which the inflorescence is usually a compound umbel.
