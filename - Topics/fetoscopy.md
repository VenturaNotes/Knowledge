- $n$. direct visualization of a fetus by passing a special fibreoptic endoscope (a fetoscope) through the abdomen of a pregnant woman into the amniotic cavity. Its original use as a technique for visualizing fetal malformations and sampling fetal blood for diagnosis of blood disorders has been abandoned with advances in high-resolution fetal imaging. It is now used to facilitate minimally invasive surgery on the fetus and placenta, either under local anaesthetic or by laparotomy on the mother; the fetoscope can be directed into place using real-time imaging. Fetoscopic laser ablation of placental vessels is now commonly used in cases of twin-to-twin transfusion.
