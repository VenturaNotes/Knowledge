Indices designed to measure two aspects of the readability of text: the reading ease score, which measures how easy the text is to read, and the human interest score, which measures how interesting it is to read. \[Named after the Austrian-born US researcher Rudolf (Franz) Flesch (1911-86), who devised the indices in 1946 and revised them in 1949]
