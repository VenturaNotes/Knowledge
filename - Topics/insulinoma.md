- $n$. an insulin-producing and usually benign tumour of the beta cells in the islets of Langerhans of the pancreas. Symptoms can include sweating, faintness, episodic loss of consciousness, and other features of hypoglycaemia (see WhiPPle's TRIAD). Single tumours can be removed surgically. Multiple very small tumours scattered throughout the pancreas cannot be treated by surgery but do respond to drugs that poison the beta cells, including diazoxide.
