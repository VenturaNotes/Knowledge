- (1) A beneficial interest in an asset. For example, a person having a house worth $£ 250,000$ with a mortgage of $£ 100,000$ may be said to have an equity of $£ 150,000$ in the house. See also NEGATIVE EQUITY. 
- (2) The amount of money returned to a borrower in a mortgage or hire-purchase agreement, after the sale of the specified asset and the full repayment of the lender of the money. 
- (3) The net assets of a company after all creditors (including the holders of preference shares) have been paid off. 
- (4) The ordinary share capital of a company (see EQUITY CAPITAL). 
- (5) The market value of a company's issued ordinary shares. 
- (6) The system of law developed by the medieval chancellors and later by the Court of Chancery. It is distinguished from the common law, which was developed by the king's courts, having originated from the residual jurisdiction delegated by the king to the chancellor. A citizen dissatisfied by the common law could petition the chancellor, who might grant relief on an ad-hoc basis. In time this developed into a complementary but separate system of law providing remedies unavailable at common law, such as specific performance of a contract rather than damages. Until 1873 equity was applied and administered by the Court of Chancery, and equitable remedies were not available in the common law courts (and vice versa). However, the Judicature Acts of 1873 and 1875 merged the two systems so that any court may now apply both common law and equity. If the two sets of rules contradict each other, the equitable rule prevails. Equity has been particularly important in the development of the law of trusts, land law, administration of estates, and alternative remedies for breach of contract. See also NEGATIVE EQUITY.

- The concept of distributive justice used in welfare economics. Equity is a general concept that can be given alternative meanings when formalized. As a general concept it refers to the belief that the distribution of economic welfare matters, and that increasing the equality of distribution is a laudable objective. The degree to which equity should be pursued by a policy-maker depends on the rate at which efficiency has to be sacrificed to achieve equity, and on social preferences as summarized in the social welfare function. One formalization is the concept of horizontal equity: those who are equal should be treated equally. For example, when applied to taxation horizontal equity implies that consumers of equal ability should pay the same amount of tax. A second formalization is vertical equity: welfare should be transferred from those with high ability (who have the opportunity to earn high incomes) to those with lower ability. For example, high-ability consumers should pay relatively more tax.

- $n$. the absence of disparities in those aspects of health that can be controlled and modified. Discussion of equity usually accepts that complete health equality is impossible, as some factors (such as genetic differences) are not modifiable.
