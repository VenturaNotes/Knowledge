- the neurological disorder complicating a deficiency of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ or folate and often combined with pernicious anaemia, which causes malabsorption of the vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ by the production of intrinsic factor antibodies. There is selective damage to the motor and sensory nerve fibres in the spinal cord, resulting in spasticity of the limbs and a sensory ataxia. It may also be accompanied by damage to the peripheral nerves and the optic nerve and by dementia. It is treated by giving vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ injections.
