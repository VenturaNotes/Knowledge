- A government system for paying allowances to the sick and the unemployed, as well as maternity benefits and retirement pensions. Other low-income members of society are also eligible, such as the disabled and single-parent families. In the UK this is now the responsibility of the Department for Work and Pensions; the National Insurance scheme that funds the social security payments is administered by HM Revenue and Customs.
