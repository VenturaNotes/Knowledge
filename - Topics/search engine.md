- A search engine is a software program, accessible on the internet, that allows internet users to search for content on the World Wide Web. Typically an internet user will enter keywords and boolean operators such as “and”, “not”, or “or” into a search engine’s search box to receive a list of web content results that match their search query. Commonly used search engines include Google, Bing, AOL, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo. Businesses often use search engines to conduct market research on their target audiences.

- A service provided on the Internet that enables the user to search for items of interest. Some, such as the widely used Google, Yahoo, and Bing, are free and attempt to capture information from the whole range of material available on the net. Others are subscription-based but in return provide access to specialist publications, full-text retrieval capabilities, or other added-value services.
