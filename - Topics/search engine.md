- A search engine is a software program, accessible on the internet, that allows internet users to search for content on the World Wide Web. Typically an internet user will enter keywords and boolean operators such as “and”, “not”, or “or” into a search engine’s search box to receive a list of web content results that match their search query. Commonly used search engines include Google, Bing, AOL, DuckDuckGo, and Yahoo. Businesses often use search engines to conduct market research on their target audiences.
