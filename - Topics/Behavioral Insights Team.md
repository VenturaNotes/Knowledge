- Also known as the 'Nudge Unit', BIT was formerly a UK government institution but is now a social purpose company partly owned by the UK government. The unit was set up with the aim of applying ideas from the behavioural sciences, including behavioural economics, to design cost-effective public policies that induce desirable behavioural responses and thus facilitate individual choices that are judged as 'better' by the UK government. See also PATERNALISM.
