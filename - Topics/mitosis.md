## Synthesis
- Of the 3 major [[cell]] types, this process of cell division occurs in [[eukaryotic cells]] and [[Archaeal Cells]]
## Source[^1]
- During mitosis, a cell duplicates all of its contents, including its chromosomes, and splits to form two identical daughter cells
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a type of cell division in which a single cell produces two genetically identical daughter cells. It is the way in which new body cells are produced for both growth and repair. Division of the nucleus (karyokinesis) takes place in four stages (see PROPHASE; METAPHASE; ANAPHASE; TELOPHASE) and is followed by division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis) to form the two daughter cells (see illustration overleaf). Compare MEIOSIS. $\textendash$mitotic adj.

## Source[^3]
- (pl. mitoses) A type of nuclear division that results in two daughter cells each having a nucleus containing the same number and kind of chromosomes as the mother cell. The changes during divisions are clearly visible with a light microscope. Each chromosome divides lengthwise into two chromatids, which separate and form the chromosomes of the resulting daughter nuclei. The process is divided into four stages, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, which merge into each other. Mitotic divisions ensure that all the cells of an individual are genetically identical to each other and to the original fertilized egg. See also CELL CYCLE.
