## Source [^1]
- Of the 3 major [[cell]] types, this process of cell division occurs in [[eukaryotic cells]] and [[Archaeal Cells]]
## Source[^2]
- During mitosis, a cell duplicates all of its contents, including its chromosomes, and splits to form two identical daughter cells
## Source[^3]
- $n$. a type of cell division in which a single cell produces two genetically identical daughter cells. It is the way in which new body cells are produced for both growth and repair. Division of the nucleus (karyokinesis) takes place in four stages (see PROPHASE; METAPHASE; ANAPHASE; TELOPHASE) and is followed by division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis) to form the two daughter cells (see illustration overleaf). Compare MEIOSIS. $\textendash$mitotic adj.
