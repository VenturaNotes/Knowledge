## Synthesis
- Of the 3 major [[cell]] types, this process of cell division occurs in [[eukaryotic cells]] and [[Archaeal Cells]]
## Source[^1]
- During mitosis, a cell duplicates all of its contents, including its chromosomes, and splits to form two identical daughter cells
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a type of cell division in which a single cell produces two genetically identical daughter cells. It is the way in which new body cells are produced for both growth and repair. Division of the nucleus (karyokinesis) takes place in four stages (see PROPHASE; METAPHASE; ANAPHASE; TELOPHASE) and is followed by division of the cytoplasm (cytokinesis) to form the two daughter cells (see illustration overleaf). Compare MEIOSIS. $\textendash$mitotic adj.

## Source[^3]
- (pl. mitoses) A type of nuclear division that results in two daughter cells each having a nucleus containing the same number and kind of chromosomes as the mother cell. The changes during divisions are clearly visible with a light microscope. Each chromosome divides lengthwise into two chromatids, which separate and form the chromosomes of the resulting daughter nuclei. The process is divided into four stages, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, and telophase, which merge into each other. Mitotic divisions ensure that all the cells of an individual are genetically identical to each other and to the original fertilized egg. See also CELL CYCLE.

## Source[^4]
- $n$. A form of cell division of somatic cells in which each of the daughter nuclei contains the same number of chromosomes as the parent nucleus, this being the normal form of cell division except for the formation of gametes (see illustration). During prophase the nuclear membrane disappears and the chromosomes divide lengthwise into chromatids, which become the chromosomes of the daughter cells; during metaphase nuclear spindles are formed, and the chromosomes attach themselves to the equator of the spindles by their centromeres; during anaphase the newly duplicated chromosomes separate and migrate to opposite ends of the spindles; and during the final telophase the cell pinches in the middle and a nuclear membrane forms around the chromosomes at each end. The movements taking place during mitosis are controlled by the cell's cytoskeleton, and especially by movements of microtubules. Compare meiosis (1). mitotic adj. mitotic clock See telomere. \[From Greek mitos a thread + -osis indicating a process or state]
