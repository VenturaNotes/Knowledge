- A UK government scheme intended to facilitate bank lending to smaller companies by guaranteeing $75 \%$ of a company's overdraft in return for a $2 \%$ annual premium (borrowers are nevertheless responsible for repayment of $100 \%$ of the loan). The scheme is available to all UK companies with a turnover of no more than $Â£ 41$ million. It replaced the former Small Firms Guarantee Scheme, which had a more limited eligibility, from January 2009.
