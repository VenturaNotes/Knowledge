- The purchase or redemption of its own shares by a company; this is permitted subject to certain legal restrictions. For example, in the UK redeemable shares may only be redeemed if they are fully paid.

The Companies Act 2006 made it easier for private companies to reduce their capital in this way. See also PERMISSIBLE CAPITAL PAYMENT.
