- IP Centrex platforms offer a range of PBX replacement and new services. IP Centrex platforms can be deployed as hosted solutions or on-premise. They are designed to offer the same benefits of an enterprise PBX system with greater flexibility in deployment options. An IP Centrex platform is usually a software-based solution for delivering telephone service to businesses replacing traditional PBX systems. This allows customers who only need basic calling capabilities (such as voicemail) without investing in an expensive hardware system such as VoIP phone equipment or other infrastructure such as routers and switches.
