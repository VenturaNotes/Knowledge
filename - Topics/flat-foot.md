- $n$. absence or collapse of the arch along the instep of the foot, so that the sole lies flat upon the ground. It is common in children until the age of six years, by which time the arch will usually have developed. Flat-foot that persists into adulthood may be due to an underlying bony disorder (rigid flat-foot) and may require surgery. Medical name: pes planus.
