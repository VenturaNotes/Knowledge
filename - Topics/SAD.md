- (seasonal affective disorder) a disorder marked by changes of mood at particular times of the year. Typically, with the onset of winter, there is depression, general slowing of mind and body, excessive sleeping, and overeating. These symptoms resolve with the coming of spring. The phenomenon may partly account for the known seasonal variation in suicide rates. Prevalence increases with latitude and younger people (especially women) are most likely to be affected. There is evidence that mood is related to light, which suppresses the release of the hormone melatonin from the pineal gland. Exposure to additional light during the day may relieve symptoms.
