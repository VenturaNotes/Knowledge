- $n$. an interaction between a bacteriophage and its host in which a latent form of the phage (prophage) exists within the bacterial cell, which is not destroyed. Under certain conditions (e.g. irradiation of the bacterium) the phage can develop into an active form, which reproduces itself and eventually destroys the bacterial cell.
## Source[^2]
- The relationship between a temperate phage (see BACTERIOPHAGE) and a bacterium. A bacterium whose chromosome has been integrated with the DNA of a temperate phage is called a lysogen; the viral DNA is known as a prophage.
