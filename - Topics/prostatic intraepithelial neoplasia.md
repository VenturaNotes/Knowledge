- (PIN) abnormal cells in the prostate that are not cancer, but may be associated with cancer within the prostate. Typically, PIN will be found in prostate biopsies taken because levels of prostate specific antigen are elevated. Multifocal high-grade PIN (HGPIN) on a prostate biopsy may indicate that another set of prostate biopsies should be taken in the future.
