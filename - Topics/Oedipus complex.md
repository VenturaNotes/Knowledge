- In Freudian theory, repressed sexual feelings of a child for its opposite-sexed parent, combined with rivalry towards the same-sexed parent: said to be a normal stage of development. The end of the Oedipus complex in children is marked by a loss of sexual feelings towards the opposite-sexed parent and an increase in identification with the same-sexed parent. Arrest of development at the Oedipal stage is said to be responsible for sexual deviations and other neurotic behavior.
