- An indication that something which could be subtracted has not been. The word appears in economics in a variety of contexts. Gross investment is total investment spending, before making any deduction for capital consumption, which is subtracted to get net investment. Similarly, gross domestic product (GDP) is the total of production for consumption, investment, and government use, before making any deduction for capital consumption; net domestic product is GDP minus capital consumption. Gross assets are total assets held, disregarding any liabilities; net assets are gross assets minus liabilities. The gross weight of a product includes packaging; net weight is gross weight minus the weight of any packaging.
