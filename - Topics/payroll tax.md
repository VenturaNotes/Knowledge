- A tax on wage payments. The UK's National Insurance contributions, for example, are a payroll tax. Many other countries have similar taxes, which make up a large part of the tax wedge between the costs of employment and wages received. Payroll taxes tend to discourage employment by raising the cost of labor relative to the cost of capital.
