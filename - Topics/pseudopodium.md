- (pl. pseudopodia) A temporary outgrowth of the cell of some protists (e.g. Amoeba), which serves as a feeding and locomotory organ. Pseudopodia may be blunt or threadlike, form a branching network, or be stiffened with an internal supporting rod. Phagocytic white blood cells also form pseudopodia to engulf invading bacteria. See AMOEBOID MOVEMENT.
