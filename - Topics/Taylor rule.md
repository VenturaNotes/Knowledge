- A monetary rule that summarizes the behavior of a central bank which adjusts the interest rate (say, $r$ ) in response to a deviation of the inflation rate $(\pi)$ or the output gap $(y)$ from their target values. The original equation, proposed by John Taylor, had the form $r=\pi+0.5 y+0.5(\pi-2)+2$ so that the target inflation rate is 2 per cent and the target output gap is zero. See also MONETARY POLICY.
