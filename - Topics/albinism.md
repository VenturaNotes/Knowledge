- Hereditary lack of pigmentation (see MELANIN) in an organism. Albino animals and human beings have no color in their skin, hair, or eyes (the irises appear pink from underlying blood vessels). The allele responsible is recessive to the allele for normal pigmentation.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the inherited absence of pigmentation in the skin, hair, and eyes, resulting in white hair and pink skin and eyes. The pink color is produced by blood in underlying blood vessels, which are normally masked by pigment. Ocular signs are reduced visual acuity, sensitivity to light (see PHOTOPHOBIA), and involuntary side-to-side eye movements.
