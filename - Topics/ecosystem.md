- An ecosystem is formed by organisms in interaction with their environment
## Source[^2]
- A biological community and the physical environment associated with it. Ecosystems seldom have discrete boundaries, and they can range in scale from a rotting log to an entire forest. Nutrients pass between the different organisms in an ecosystem in definite pathways; for example, nutrients in the soil are taken up by plants, which are then eaten by herbivores, which in turn may be eaten by carnivores (see FOOD CHAIN). Organisms are classified on the basis of their position in an ecosystem into various trophic levels. Nutrients and energy move round ecosystems in loops or cycles (in the case above, for example, nutrients are returned to the soil via animal wastes and decomposition). See CARBON CYCLE; NITROGEN CYCLE.
