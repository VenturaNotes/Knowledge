- adj. (in computerized tomography or magnetic resonance imaging) denoting the acquisition of data when the slice thickness is similar in size to that of an individual pixel in all planes, i.e. the voxel is a cube. Computerized reconstruction in any plane will not suffer any loss of detail. The concept is particularly applicable for multidetector computerized tomography, in which slice thickness of less than 1 mm is used.
