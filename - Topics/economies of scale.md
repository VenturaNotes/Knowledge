- This means that for many goods, as the level of production increases, the average cost of producing each individual unit declines

- The factors which make it possible for larger organizations or countries to produce goods or services more cheaply than smaller ones. Economies of scale which are internal to firms are due to indivisibilities and the division of labour. If specialized equipment comes in units of some minimum size a larger total output makes it more economic to use. The division of labour means that it is possible with a larger workforce to restrict the range of tasks performed by each individual worker. Also, in a larger firm the breakdown of any particular piece of equipment, or the absence of any individual worker, causes less disruption to production. Against these sources of economies of scale has to be set the increasing difficulty of coordinating and motivating people in larger organizations. How large a firm can become before the problems of scale outweigh the economies varies widely between different industries. Economies of scale which are external to firms, but operate at the national level, arise from similar causes; there is scope for more specialist services in a large economy than in a small one.
