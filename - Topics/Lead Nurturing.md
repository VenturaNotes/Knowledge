- Lead nurturing is the process of building a meaningful relationship with a potential customer in order to eventually turn that lead into a sale. There are many lead nurturing techniques. Salespeople may speak to customers who have shown interest face-to-face or on the phone. Increasingly, though, digital and automated methods are becoming more popular. Social media, chatbots, automated responses on websites and blogs, and SEO-focused content all help create and nurture leads. Email marketing is often used to follow up with leads who have shown interest but have not yet committed.
