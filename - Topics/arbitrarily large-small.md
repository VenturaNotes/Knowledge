- To say that there are arbitrarily large prime numbers means that the set of prime numbers is not bounded above, and this phrase is generally used for sets that are not bounded above. Similarly, to say that there are arbitrarily small positive rationals means that given any $\varepsilon>0$ there exists a rational number $q$ in the range $0<q<\varepsilon$. Compare SUFFICIENTLY LARGE/SMALL.
