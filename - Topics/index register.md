- A register that can be specified by instructions that use indexed addressing. An index register is usually controlled by one or more instructions with the ability to increment or decrement the register by a fixed amount, to test the register for equality with a specified value (often zero), and to jump to a specified location when equality is achieved. It may be part of the processor status word.
