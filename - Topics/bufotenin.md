- $n$. A psychoactive drug found in cohoba snuff, in the mushroom Amanita muscaria, and in the poisonous secretions from the skin glands of toads. It is an indole alkaloid and an analogue of serotonin, but unlike true serotonin it has psychedelic or hallucinogenic effects and also functions as an aphrodisiac. The metabolism of serotonin into bufotenin instead of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid is believed to be of significance in the aetiology of schizophrenia. Also spelt bufotenine . See also phantaSticant. \[From Latin bufo a toad + -ten origin unknown, perhaps from Latin tenus a snare + -ine indicating an organic compound]
