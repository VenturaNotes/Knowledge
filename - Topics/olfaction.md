- (1) the sense of smell. 
- (2) the process of smelling. Sensory cells in the mucous membrane that lines the nasal cavity are stimulated by the presence of chemical particles dissolved in the mucus. See NOSE. $\textemdash$olfactory adj.
## Source[^2]
- The sense of smell or the process of detecting smells. This is achieved by receptors in olfactory organs (such as the nose in vertebrates) that are sensitive to air- or water-borne chemicals. Stimulation of these receptors results in the transmission of information to the brain via the olfactory nerve. Fishes have olfactory receptors located in pits on the snout just in front of the eyes. Each pit is lined by a folded sensory epithelium, which detects chemicals in water flowing through the pit, via incurrent and excurrent openings (nares). Chemicals in the water are also detected by taste buds located over the body surface. Insects smell airborne odorants using olfactory hairs on their antennae. See VOMERONASAL ORGAN.

- $n$. The sense of smell or the act or process of smelling, occurring when molecules of an aromatic substance are drawn into the upper nasal cavity and are captured by olfactory receptor neurons that are specialized for specific kinds of odours and that respond by generating nerve impulses and transmitting them to the olfactory bulbs, the type or types of activated neurons indicating the quality of the odour and the number of activated neurons indicating its intensity, the input pattern being analysed in the olfactory bulbs and transmitted directly to the olfactory cortex and the amygdala, and from there to the entorhinal cortex, where information from disparate sensory receptors is integrated. It is more effective than any other sense in reawakening memories from the distant past, especially the emotions associated with past experiences, though the literary passage most often cited in support of this phenomenon, quoted under redintegration, actually refers to taste rather than smell.
