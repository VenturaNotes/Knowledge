- Selling commodities, securities, currencies, etc. that one does not currently own. A short seller expects prices to fall so that a profit can be made by buying in the assets at a lower price than that received from the sale. Normally, the short seller will borrow the asset in the interim to ensure that delivery can be made at the agreed date: when he or she omits to do so, the practice is known as naked short selling. Since 2008 many regulatory authorities, including the US Securities and Exchange Commission, have placed restrictions on short selling (and especially naked short selling).
