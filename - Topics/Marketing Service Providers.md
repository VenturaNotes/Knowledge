- Marketing service providers are companies that offer marketing services to other businesses. Marketing service providers (MSPs) provide various services, including system integration, creative services, third-party data, application service provider (ASP), and hosted solutions to marketing organizations. They can be either independent or a full-service marketing company division that provides a range of services such as sales promotion and direct response to customers. As well as offering advice, they often handle all aspects of the project including planning strategies and implementing campaigns through any necessary media outlets (such as newspapers and television) before analyzing results obtained after the campaign has finished.
