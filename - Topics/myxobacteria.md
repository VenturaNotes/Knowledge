- A group of proteobacteria that can live in highly organized swarms that exhibit many characteristics of multicellular organisms, such as cell differentiation, division of labour, intercellular communication, and coordinated movement. When food is scarce, the swarm forms a fruiting body, in which some cells differentiate into resistant spores which can survive adverse conditions, whereas other cells are sacrificed.
