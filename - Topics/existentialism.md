- $n$. A philosophical movement, inspired by phenomenology, that developed in the second quarter of the 20th century under the influence of the Danish philosopher and religious thinker SÃ¸ren Aabye Kierkegaard (1813-55), the German philosopher Martin Heidegger (1889-1976), and the French philosophers and writers Jean-Paul Sartre (1905-80), Simone de Beauvoir (1908-86), and Albert Camus (1913-60). It stresses the existence of the individual person as a free agent who is burdened with personal responsibility and whose existence cannot be investigated objectively, being revealed by reflection on existence in time and space. It tends to disparage scientific methodology and knowledge and to reject objective values.
