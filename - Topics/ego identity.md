- $n$. In ego psychology, a term introduced by the German-born psychoanalyst Erik H. Erikson (1902-94) in 1946 to denote a psychological state that an individual achieves at the end of adolescence if earlier developmental crises have been successfully negotiated. It involves a sense of personal identity (who one is) and of how one is perceived by others. An adolescent who fails to achieve ego identity is likely to experience despair, to lack a sense of comradeship with peer groups, and to have difficulty handling intimacy and forming loving relationships.
