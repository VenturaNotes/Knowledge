- $n$. A philosophical analysis of culture in general and literature in particular, associated especially with the Frankfurt school, that rejects the possibility of a value-free social science and attempts to address the historical and ideological factors that influence culture and human behavior. Its proponents conceive it as a practical and normative (1) theory, rather than as a positive or descriptive theory, and one that seeks to expose the contradictions in people's belief systems and social practices with a view to changing them. When focusing on psychological issues, also called critical psychology . Compare LIBERATION PSYCHOLOGY.
