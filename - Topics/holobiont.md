- A host and all its associated symbiotic organisms and viruses. For example, a lichen can be viewed as a holobiont comprising algal and fungal partners. More broadly, a human individual plus the microorganisms contained within the gut or living on the skin surface may also constitute a holobiont. This 'superorganism' is regarded by some as the organizational level at which natural selection acts. See hOlogenOME.
