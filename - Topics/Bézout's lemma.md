- Given two positive integers $a$ and $b$ with greatest common divisor $h$, there exist integers $u$ and $v$ such that $u a+v b=h$. The integers $u$ and $v$ can be constructed using the Euclidean algorithm. BÃ©zout's lemma has significance for the Chinese remainder theorem and for linear Diophantine equations.
