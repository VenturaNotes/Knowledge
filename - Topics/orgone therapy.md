- $n$. A form of psychotherapy and a treatment for cancer and other physical ailments devised by the Austrian (later US-based) psychiatrist Wilhelm Reich (1897-1957), first described briefly though not named in his book The Function of the Orgasm (1942), then more fully in The Cancer Biopathy (1948) and Character Analysis (3rd ed., 1949). Physical orgone therapy involved an orgone accumulator or box designed to concentrate naturally occurring orgone energy believed to permeate the atmosphere. Reich believed that orgasms regulate bio-energy levels and were necessary for maintenance of mental and physical health. Also called Reichian therapy. See also BODY THERAPIES. \[Coined as a blend of org(asm) and (horm)one]
