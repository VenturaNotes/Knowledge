- A liquid polyunsaturated fatty acid with three double bonds in its structure: $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}: \mathrm{CHCH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}: \mathrm{CHCH}_{2} \mathrm{CH}: \mathrm{CH}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{2}\right)_{7} \mathrm{COOH}$. Linolenic acid occurs in certain plant oils, e.g. linseed and soya-bean oil, and in algae. It is one of the essential fatty acids.
