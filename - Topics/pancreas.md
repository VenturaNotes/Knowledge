- $n$. a compound gland, about 15 cm long, that lies behind the stomach. One end lies in the curve of the duodenum; the other end touches the spleen. It is composed of clusters (acini) of cells that secrete pancreatic juice. This contains a number of enzymes concerned in digestion. The juice drains into small ducts that open into the pancreatic duct. This unites with the common bile duct and the secretions pass into the duodenum. Interspersed among the acini are the islets of Langerhans $\textendash$ isolated groups of cells that secrete the hormones insulin and glucagon into the bloodstream.

- (pl. pancreases) A gland in vertebrates lying between the duodenum and the spleen. Under the influence of the hormone secretin it secretes pancreatic juice containing bicarbonate ions, which neutralize the acidity of chyme entering the duodenum from the stomach, and digestive enzymes or their precursors (trypsin, chymotrypsin, amylase, lipase, nuclease, and carboxypeptidase). This mixture is discharged into the duodenum via the pancreatic duct (see acinus). The pancreas also contains groups of cells-the islets of Langerhans$\textemdash$that function as an endocrine gland, producing the hormones insulin and glucagon, which regulate blood sugar levels.
