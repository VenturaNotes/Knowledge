## Source [^1]
- The combination of two or more companies under the same control for their mutual benefit, by reducing competition, saving costs by reducing overheads, capturing a larger market share, pooling resources, cooperating on research and development, enhancing competitive advantage, etc. In horizontal (or lateral) integration the businesses carry out the same stage in the value chain or produce similar products or services; they are therefore competitors. In a monopoly, horizontal integration is complete, while in an oligopoly there is considerable horizontal integration. In vertical integration a company obtains control of its suppliers (sometimes called backward integration) or of the concerns that buy its products or services (forward integration). Conglomerate integration takes place between firms in different value chains.
