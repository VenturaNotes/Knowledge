- EIM (enterprise information management) involves processing, describing, storing, and governing data assets. Digital tools automate the EIM process. These programs process structured and unstructured data sets from disparate sources and secure that data in a single system. These tools then generate business intelligence metrics for better decision-making. The best EIM tools ensure this data management complies with all data governance frameworks, including legislation such as GDPR and HIPAA.
