- The type of sampling error that results from following an incomplete or improper selection process in sampling (see SAMPLE). Often, respondents who are not relevant to the study are used in surveys. For example, ownership of a car may be a prerequisite for an interview, but a respondent may be selected who merely has the use of a car, rather than owning one.
