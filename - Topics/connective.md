- A logical device used for the construction of more complex statements or expressions from simpler statements or expressions. Examples in everyday use are 'and', 'or', and 'not'. Connectives also occur in Boolean algebra, switching theory, digital design, formal logic, and in programming languages. In all these cases they are used, often as operators, in the formation of more complex logical or Boolean expressions or statements from simpler components. These simpler components inevitably have a value that is either true or false. Truth tables describe the effect or result of using a connective, given the truth of the simpler components.
