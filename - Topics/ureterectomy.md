- $n$. surgical removal of a ureter. This usually includes removal of the associated kidney as well (see NEPHROURETERECTOMY). If previous nephrectomy has been performed to remove a kidney that has been destroyed by vesicoureteric reflux or because of a tumor of the renal pelvis, subsequent ureterectomy may be necessary to cure reflux into the stump of the ureter or tumor in the ureter, respectively. Less commonly, in certain cases an isolated segment of a ureter may be removed for a short ureteric stricture or ureteric tumor.
