- $n$. The basic unit of semantic analysis, roughly equivalent to a word in the everyday sense but referring more precisely to the abstract unit postulated to underlie a set of grammatical variants such as write, writes, writing, wrote or loud, louder, loudest; the smallest unit of language with a distinctive meaning that cannot be inferred from the meanings of its component morphemes. Many lexemes consist of single words (such as game, castle, or sing), but multi-word lexemes also exist (as in kick the bucket, meaning die). Also called a lexical item. \[From Greek lexis a word, from legein to speak + a suffix on the model of phoneme]
