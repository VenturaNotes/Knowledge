- The loss of significant digits in subtracting two approximately equal numbers. This is a frequent cause of poor accuracy in numerical results but it can usually be avoided by some reorganization of the calculation. Consider, for example, the quadratic equation$$ax^2+bx+c=0$$The formula for the roots of a quadratic is $$\left(-b \pm \sqrt{ }\left(b^{2}-4 a c\right)\right) / 2 a$$if $b^{2}$ is large compared with $4|a c|$ severe cancellation occurs in one of the roots. This root can be computed from the fact that the product of the roots is $c / a$.

- The right to cancel a commercial contract after it has been entered into. The right to cancel exists generally for contracts concluded at a distance (see DISTANCE SELLING), such as mail order and Internet sales when the contract is with a consumer, and in particular in such sectors as time-share sales and consumer credit.
