- $n$. The philosophical problem, usually attributed to the French philosopher Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650) of explaining the apparent interaction of mental and physical events, which appear to belong to two quite separate realms of existence, as when a (mental) wish gives rise to a (physical) bodily movement or a (physical) pinprick to a (mental) sensation of pain. The problem was appreciated by Descartes only after he received a letter in 1643 from Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia (1596-1662), the daughter of King James I of England and VI of Scotland, pointing it out. See also Cartesian dualism, double-ASPECT theory, dualism, EPIPHENOMENALISM, IDENTITY THEORY, INTERACTIONISM (1), MATERIALISM, MONISM, NEUTRAL MONISM, PSYCHOPHYSICAL PARALLELISM.
