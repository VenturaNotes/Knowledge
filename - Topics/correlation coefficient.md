- A unit-free measure of the degree of linear relationship between two random variables, say, $X$ and $Y$ defined by$$\rho_{X Y}=\frac{\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)}{\sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(X)} \sqrt{\operatorname{Var}(Y)}}$$where $\operatorname{Cov}(X, Y)$ is the covariance between $X$ and $Y$. The correlation coefficient lies between -1 and 1 , with $\rho_{X Y}=1$ corresponding to a perfect positive linear relationship, and $\rho_{X Y}=-1$ corresponding to a perfect negative linear relationship between $X$ and $Y$. Positive (negative) correlation means that large values of $X$ are likely to be observed with large (small) values of $Y$.
