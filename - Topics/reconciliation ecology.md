- The branch of ecology concerned with designing new wildlife habitats and enhancing existing ones in areas that are already exploited by humans for e.g. agriculture, housing, industry, or mining. The aim is to promote biodiversity alongside human land use$\textemdash$in other words, to reconcile the two. Such a strategy can create greater connectivity between remaining areas of pristine habitat, e.g. by establishing wildlife corridors, besides increasing the value of local ecosystem services. Reconciliation ecology is multifaceted and tailored to the requirements of each particular area.
