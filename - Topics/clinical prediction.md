- $n$. Prediction based on subjective judgement or intuition, as when a psychologist uses clinical experience to formulate a prediction informally, on the basis of interview impressions, other life-history data, and possibly psychometric test data, about how an individual is likely to behave or respond to treatment. The first systematic analysis and comparison of clinical prediction and actuarial prediction was made by the US psychologist Paul Everett Meehl (1920-2003) in his book Clinical and Statistical Prediction: A Theoretical Analysis and a Review of the Evidence in 1954.
