- Goods intended for use in production of other goods or services, rather than for final consumption. Some goods, such as power stations and oil-drilling equipment, can only be capital goods. Many goods can be used for either production or consumption: cars, for example, may be used for business purposes or privately, and furniture may be used in private homes or for business purposes in hotels and restaurants. See also FINAL GOODS.
