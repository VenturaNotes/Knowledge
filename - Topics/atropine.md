- $n$. an antimuscarinic drug that occurs in deadly nightshade (see BELLADONNA). Because it dilates the pupil and paralyses the ciliary muscle (see CYCLOPLEGIA; MYDRIATIC), atropine is used in eye examinations and the treatment of anterior uveitis. It is also administered by injection to treat a slow heart rate (bradycardia) associated with arrhythmias or, with neostigmine, to reverse the action of muscle relaxants used during surgery. It is sometimes used to treat gut spasms and $\textendash$ rarely $\textendash$ for premedication. Common side-effects include dryness of the throat, thirst, impaired vision, and increased heart rate.
