- $n$. an antimuscarinic drug that occurs in deadly nightshade (see BELLADONNA). Because it dilates the pupil and paralyses the ciliary muscle (see CYCLOPLEGIA; MYDRIATIC), atropine is used in eye examinations and the treatment of anterior uveitis. It is also administered by injection to treat a slow heart rate (bradycardia) associated with arrhythmias or, with neostigmine, to reverse the action of muscle relaxants used during surgery. It is sometimes used to treat gut spasms and $\textendash$ rarely $\textendash$ for premedication. Common side-effects include dryness of the throat, thirst, impaired vision, and increased heart rate.

- A poisonous crystalline alkaloid, $\mathrm{C}_{17} \mathrm{H}_{23} \mathrm{NO}_{3}$. It can be extracted from deadly nightshade and other solanaceous plants and is used in medicine to treat colic, to reduce secretions, and to dilate the pupil of the eye.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A poisonous alkaloid obtained from the deadly nightshade plant Atropa belladonna, being a muscarine antagonist (3) that blocks the action of acetylcholine in the parasympathetic nervous system, paralyzing smooth muscles, and is used as a pre-anaesthetic medication and an antidote to chemical nerve agents. It was popular with medieval poisoners, and because a few drops of it in the eyes cause the pupils to dilate, it has been used throughout history by women as a cosmetic and is still used medicinally for eye examinations. See also belladonna, BZ gas, hyoscyamine, Lomotil, methyl atropine, muscarinic receptor. Compare curare, scopolamine, strychnine. \[From Greek Atropos the eldest of the three Fates and the one who cuts the thread of life, from atropos that may not be turned away from, from $a$- without + tropos a turn, from trepein to turn]
