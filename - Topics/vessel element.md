- A type of cell occurring within the xylem of flowering plants, many of which, end to end, form water-conducting vessels. Vessel elements are frequently very broad and have side walls thickened by deposits of lignin over most of the surface area. However, the end walls are broken down to provide connections with the cells both above and below them, forming a continuous hollow 'pipe'. Compare TRACHEID.
