In the western world it mainly affects adolescents and young adults; in developing countries young children are most affected. After an incubation period of 5-7 days, symptoms commence with swelling and tenderness of the lymph nodes, fever, headache, a sore throat, lethargy, and loss of appetite. In some cases the liver is affected, causing hepatitis, or the spleen is enlarged. Glandular fever is diagnosed by the presence of large numbers of monocytes in the blood. Complications are rare but symptoms may persist for weeks before recovery. Medical name: infectious mononucleosis.
