- Sometimes YMCK or "Process Color Printing"
- CMYK is often referred to by other names but simply refers to the colors Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Black (or sometimes Key) when used during printing. In this type of printing, known as process color printing, these four standard inks are mixed during the printing process to create the desired color effects. Alternatively, spot color printing uses premixed inks that are used as is or mixed prior to printing.
