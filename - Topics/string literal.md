## Synthesis
- Can use single quotes or double quotes
	- `'Hello World'`
	- `"Python is fun!"`
	- #question What is the difference between single quotes and double quotes? Is it just so that a quotation can be used within a text without confusion?
- Can use triple quote
```python
text = """This lets you
write text on multiple
lines including the 
line breaks"""

print(text)
```

Output
```
This lets you
write text on multiple
lines including the 
line breaks
```
