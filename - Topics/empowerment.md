- In human-resource management, the giving of increased responsibility and a measure of control to employees in their working lives. The concept is based on the view that people need personal satisfaction and fulfilment in their work and that responsibility and control increase satisfaction. Employees like empowerment because an increase in responsibility usually leads to greater rewards and enhanced prospects. On the other hand, it has been criticized because staff are asked to become more accountable without being given more authority. Empowerment also has the added advantage that it enables potential talents to be identified and developed, either by the employing organization or the individual.
- As well as being a motivational strategy, empowerment may occur as part of a process of re-engineering organizational structures to remove layers of management (see DELAYERING), so that the system can respond more rapidly to customers' requirements.

Being ill is usually experienced as losing the ability to act as one wishes, and full recovery may only be achieved when the individual feels able to make their own decisions. This may be a problem where professionals insist on deciding for patients with certain conditions (e.g. mental illness). Empowerment involves action to redress the lack or loss, for instance by offering explanation in a language, style, and level that is appropriate. See also AUTONOMY; FEMINIST ETHICS; PATERNALISM.
