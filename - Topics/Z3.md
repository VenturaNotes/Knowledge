- An electromechanical programmed calculator built in Berlin by Konrad Zuse and fully operational in 1941. Like the earlier (non-programmed) calculators, Z1 (mechanical) and Z2 (electromechanical), constructed by Zuse, it did not survive the war. An improved machine, the Z4, was completed by 1945. Despite the lack of a conditional branch mechanism, it was demonstrated as Turing-complete (i.e. having power equivalent to a Turing machine) by Ra√∫l Rojas in 1998.
