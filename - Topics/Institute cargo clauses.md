- Clauses, originally issued by the Institute of London Underwriters in the early 1980s, that are added to standard marine insurance policies for cargo to widen or restrict the cover given. Each clause has a wording agreed by a committee of insurance companies and Lloyd's underwriters. By attaching particular clauses to the policy the insurers are able to create an individual policy to suit the clients' requirements.
