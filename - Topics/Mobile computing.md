## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Generally, any application in which the computing system used is not assigned a specific location. In some cases the movement of the system is an essential element of the application; for example the system may be mounted in a vehicle, or may be used by someone whose work demands visits to different locations with no on-site computing facilities. In other cases it is the end-user who may move from place to place, each equipped with computing facilities, and along the way the user is able to use any network-connected workstation that will automatically reconfigure itself so as to reconstruct the environment he or she was last using on some other workstation. This requires the user to carry a machine-readable identification.
