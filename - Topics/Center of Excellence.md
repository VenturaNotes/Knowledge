- The center of excellence (CoE) is a small, dedicated, cross-disciplinary unit within an organization assembled to offer expertise in a specific area. A CoE sits outside of the traditional business hierarchy, bringing people and resources together to explore new techniques and technologies, and accelerate their adoption. The goals of a CoE include providing thought leadership, research and development, and establishing best practices.
