- $n$. a bowel movement in which faeces are evacuated through the rectum and anus. The amount and composition of the food eaten determine to a large degree the bulk of the faeces, and the transit time through the intestinal tract determines the water content. See CONSTIPATION; DIARRHOEA.
## Source[^2]
- The expulsion of faeces from the rectum due to contractions of muscles in the rectal wall. A sphincter muscle, which is under voluntary control, is situated at the end of the rectum (the anus); relaxation of this muscle allows defecation to occur. In babies control of the anal sphincter muscle has not been developed and defecation occurs automatically as a reflex response to the presence of faeces in the rectum.
