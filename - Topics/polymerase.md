## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Any enzyme that catalyses the elongation of a polymeric molecule. RNA polymerases (types I to III) catalyze the synthesis of RNA using as a template either an existing DNA strand (DNA-dependent RNA polymerase) or an RNA strand. Type I is responsible for the synthesis of ribosomal RNA, type II for messenger RNA synthesis (see TRANSCRIPTION), and type III for transfer RNA synthesis. DNA polymerases catalyse the elongation of a new DNA strand during DNA replication, using an existing DNA strand as template. RNA-directed DNA polymerase is more usually known as reverse transcriptase.
## Source[^2]
- An enzyme that assembles nucleic acids from nucleotides. The type of polymerase for assembling DNA is called DNA polymerase, whereas that for RNA is called RNA polymerase. The analogous type of polymerase for assembling proteins from amino acids might be expected to be called ‘protein polymerase’, but for historic reasons is known as the ribosome. See also Polymerase Chain Reaction.
