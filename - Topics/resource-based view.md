- (RBV) A model holding that a company's business strategy should be determined principally by its internal resources$\textemdash$assets, capabilities, processes, and intellectual capital$\textemdash$rather than by external factors, such as market opportunity. The RBV holds that a company can create sustained competitive advantage where its resources satisfy the so-called VRIN criteria: i.e. where its resources are valuable, rare, imperfectly imitable, and non-substitutable. More recently, the RBV has been extended by the dynamic capabilities approach. See also CORE COMPETENCY.
