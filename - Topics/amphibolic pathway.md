## Source [^1]
- A biochemical pathway that serves both anabolic and catabolic processes. An important example of an amphibolic pathway is the Krebs cycle, which involves both the catabolism of carbohydrates and fatty acids and the synthesis of anabolic precursors for amino-acid synthesis (e.g. $\alpha$-ketogluturate and oxaloacetate).
