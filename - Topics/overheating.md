## Synthesis

- The state of an economy during a boom, with increasing aggregate demand leading to rising prices rather than higher output. Overheating reflects the inability of some firms to increase output to keep up with demand; they therefore choose to profit from the excess demand by raising prices.
## Source[^2]
- In Keynesian economics this is a level of activity leading to excess demand. High output levels relative to capacity, at least in some important sectors, lead to shortages of factor inputs, or unusually high levels of imports. Overheating produces inflationary pressure internally and deterioration in the trade balance externally; by causing devaluation of the currency this gives a further boost to inflation.
