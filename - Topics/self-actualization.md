- The drive people have to realize their potential and to find fulfilment. Self-actualization encompasses the human need for challenge, responsibility, creativity, and variety at work, enabling employees to take pride in their achievements, as well as in their technical or professional expertise. An integral part of the concept is for their worth to be recognized and valued by those with, and for, whom they work. See also MASLOW's MOTIVATIONAL HIERARCHY; MOTIVATION.
