- (PVH) a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in infants who are born prematurely in which bleeding occurs from fragile blood vessels around the ventricles in the brain. Bleeding extending into the lateral ventricles is termed intraventricular haemorrhage (IVH) and in severe cases can extend into the brain tissue (cerebral parenchyma). Surviving infants may have long-term neurological deficits, such as cerebral palsy, developmental delay, or seizures.
