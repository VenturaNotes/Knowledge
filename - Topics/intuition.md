- $n$. Immediate understanding, knowledge, or awareness, derived neither from perception nor from reasoning. Immediate knowledge of a concept exists when a person can apply the concept correctly but cannot state the rules of its application; this form of intuition has been shown experimentally in studies of concept formation. The Chomskyan notion of competence (2), for example, implies intuitive knowledge of grammatical concepts. Immediate awareness of the truth of a proposition (1) (I have an intuition that I will win the lottery today) is essentially an unjustified opinion, in contradistinction to a belief or an item of knowledge. Compare attuition. intuitive adj. \[From Latin intuitio a contemplation, from intueri to gaze at, from tueri to look at]
