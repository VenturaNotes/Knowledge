- Ultra-high-speed broadband internet is internet that is capable of supporting download speeds of over 50 Mbps. That's significantly faster than the average broadband internet speed in the United States which is around 43 Mbps. Ultra-high-speed broadband internet is faster because it uses fiber-optic cables that transfer data at higher speeds than the copper wires typically used for traditional broadband.
