- A procedure adopted in the sale and purchase of land in which both parties sign their copies of the contract, having satisfied themselves as to the state of the property, etc., and agreed that they wish to be bound. There need be no physical exchange of documents; the parties or their advisers can exchange contracts by agreeing to do so orally (for example, by telephone). From that moment the contract is binding and can normally be enforced by specific performance. Contracts for the sale of land must be in writing.
