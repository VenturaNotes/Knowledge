- n. (pl. scotomata) an area of abnormally less sensitive or absent vision in the visual field surrounded by normal sight, caused by abnormalities of the visual pathway. There is a normal physiological blind spot in the visual field of each eye due to the optic disc, which is not sensitive to light. Islands of total visual loss in other parts of the field are referred to as absolute scotomata. A relative scotoma is an area where the vision is decreased but still present.
