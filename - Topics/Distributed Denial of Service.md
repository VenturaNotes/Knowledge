- A form of denial of service, performed by simultaneously sending large numbers of packets to the same host or network from many computers in different locations on the Internet, with the aim of flooding a network connection or other service. The computers used will usually have been compromised by an intruder, virus, or Trojan horse. The packets are often forged to make it hard to identify the source of the attack
