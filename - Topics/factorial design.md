## Source [^1]
- $n$. Any experimental design in which there are two or more independent variables or factors, and every level of each factor is combined with every level of each other factor. For example, if there are two factors, and if one of the factors has two levels, the other has three levels, and all six combinations are represented, then the design is called a 2 $\times 3$ factorial design.
