- a test carried out on a large number of apparently healthy people to separate those who may have a specified disease and could benefit from further testing from those who probably do not. Examples include newborn blood spot screening, cervical screening, and breast screening. The appropriateness of screening depends on the severity and epidemiology of the disease and the efficacy and availability of treatment. Other factors to be taken into account are the safety, acceptability, cost, sensitivity, and specificity of the test. No screening test is perfect, and all screening is associated with false positives and false negatives. See also genetic screening; UK National Screening.
