- (Angiospermophyta; Magnoliophyta) A phylum comprising the flowering plants (angiosperms). The gametes are produced within flowers and the ovules (and the seeds into which they develop) are enclosed in a carpel (compare CONIFEROphyta). The angiosperms are the dominant plant forms of the present day. They show the most advanced structural organization in the plant kingdom, enabling them to inhabit a very diverse range of habitats. The two main clades are the monocots (traditionally placed in the class Monocotyledoneae, broadly the same as the Liliopsida) with one seed leaf (cotyledon) in the seed; and the eudicots (class Dicotyledoneae, or Magnoliopsida) with two seed leaves. Other clades are the magnoliids, containing the magnolias, laurels, cinnamon, etc.; the water lilies; and star anise and its relatives. Sister to all these is the genus Amborella, represented now by a single species of woody shrub found only on the island of New Caledonia.
