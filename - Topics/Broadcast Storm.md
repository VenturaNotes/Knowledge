- A broadcast storm is a term used to describe problematic transmissions on networks. These transmissions can come as either one-to-many (meaning one computer attempts too many transmissions) or many-to-many (meaning multiple computers attempt too many transmissions, usually as part of spoofing or Denial of Service attack). A broadcast storm can overwhelm an entire internet network. If that happens, it can cause the network to stop functioning completely.
