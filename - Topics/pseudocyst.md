- $n$. a fluid-filled space within an organ that is not enclosed by an epithelial lining. A pancreatic pseudocyst may develop in cases of chronic pancreatitis or as a complication of acute pancreatitis. As the pseudocyst expands it may cause abdominal pain accompanied by a rise in the level of pancreatic enzymes in the blood. It may be felt by abdominal examination or identified by radiological imaging. Treatment is by endoscopic or radiological drainage or by surgery (see MARSUPIALIZATION).
