- (second-order stationary process, weakly stationary process) A time series process $y_{t}$ for which the first two moments of the joint distributions of its finite subsequences exist and are constant over time:$$E\left(y_{t}\right)=\mu<\infty, \operatorname{var}\left(y_{t}\right)=\sigma^{2}<\infty, \operatorname{Cov}\left(y_{t}, y_{t+k}\right)=y_{k}<\infty \text { for all } t$$
