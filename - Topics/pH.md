## Source [^1]
- a measure of the concentration of hydrogen ions in a solution, and therefore of its acidity or alkalinity. A pH of 7 indicates a neutral solution, a pH below 7 indicates acidity, and a pH in excess of 7 indicates alkalinity.
## Source[^2]
- abbrev. A measure of the acidity/alkalinity of a solution, originally the logarithm to the base 10 of the reciprocal of the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per cubic decimeter, now indexed to a standard solution of potassium hydrogen phthalate at $15^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, which has a pH of 4 by definition. Acid (1) solutions have pH less than 7, pure water pH equal to 7, and alkaline solutions have pH more than 7. \[Abbreviation of potential of hydrogen]
