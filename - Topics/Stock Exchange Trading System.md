- (SETS) The London Stock Exchange order-driven electronic trading system that came into operation in 1997. It has increasingly replaced the previous quote-driven system (see Stock Exchange Automated Quotations System). Buyers and sellers enter their orders, which are matched automatically. The price of the transaction is then automatically recorded on a trading report and passes into the settlement system. SETS covers the 250 shares of the FTSE 250 index and other blue chip securities.
