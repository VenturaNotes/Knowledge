- Computer-aided software engineering (CASE) is similar to computer-aided design (CAD) tools. CASE tools are used for the creation and designing of computer applications that are critical for programming tools. They come in a variety of formats, including display, design, analytics, and more. They are not the only approach when it comes to designing programs, but they are among relatively commonly used ones.
