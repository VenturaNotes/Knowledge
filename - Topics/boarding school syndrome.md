- $n$. A pattern of emotional and behavioral adjustment acquired as a protective shell by young children at boarding schools but persisting into adult life and manifesting itself in problems associated with intimacy. People displaying this syndrome may appear outwardly confident but find intimate relationships threatening, and typically enter into deeply dependent relationships only to abandon their loved ones abruptly, either emotionally or physically. \[The term was introduced by the English analytical psychotherapist Joy Schaverien (born 1943) in an article in the British Journal of Psychotherapy in 2011, followed by a book entitled Boarding School Syndrome: Broken Attachments and Hidden Trauma (2015)]
