- a collection of pus around the kidney, usually secondary to pyonephrosis but also resulting from spread of infection from other sites. It is more likely to occur in individuals who are immunosuppressed or have diabetes mellitus. Percutaneous or open surgical drainage are usually necessary but occasionally nephrectomy may be needed if the kidney is severely infected.
