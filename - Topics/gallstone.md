- $n$. a hard mass composed of bile pigments, cholesterol, and calcium salts, in varying proportions, that can form in the gall bladder. The formation of gallstones (cholelithiasis) occurs when the physical characteristics of bile alter so that cholesterol is less soluble or there is an excess of bile pigments. Diminished contractility of the gall bladder may also be a contributory factor, leading to biliary stasis. Gallstones may exist for many years without causing symptoms. However, they may cause severe pain (see BILIARY COLIC) or they may pass into the common bile duct and cause obstructive jaundice or cholangitis. Gallstones are usually diagnosed by ultrasonography, but those containing calcium may be seen on a plain X-ray (opaque stones). Symptomatic cholelithiasis is usually treated by surgical removal of the gall bladder (see CHOLECYSTECTOMY). Nonsurgical treatments, such as gallstone-dissolving drugs or lithotripsy, have proved less successful and are not in widespread use.
