- A sequence of random variables {$X_i$} such that the expected value of the (n+1)th random variable, once the first $n$ outcomes are known, is just the current value $X_n.$The simple random walk, which moves left or right one step with probability 0.5, is an example of a martingale. 
## Source[^2]
- A stochastic process in which the expectation of the future value of a variable, conditional on currently available information, including the current value, is equal to the current value of the variable.
