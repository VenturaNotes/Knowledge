- A fossil that is so small that it can only be studied under a microscope. Microfossils include bacteria, diatoms, and protists and parts of organisms, such as plant pollen and skeletal fragments. Microfossils are important in the correlation of rocks where only small samples are available. The study of microfossils, particularly pollen, is known as palynology.
