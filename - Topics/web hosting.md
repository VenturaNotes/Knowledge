- Web hosting is a service in which a vendor provides the technologies and services necessary for a website to be viewed on the internet. The web-hosting business stores the website content on a computer server. The amount of space a website has allocated on a server depends on the type of web hosting. The main types of web hosting are shared, dedicated, virtual private server (VPS), and reseller. These use different kinds of technology for the server, as well as provide different levels of management and additional services.
