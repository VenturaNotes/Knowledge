- a delusion in which the patient believes that another person or an animal (usually the patient's pet) has certain physical symptoms, even though these cannot be objectively verified. The patient with the delusional belief is called the inducer; the person or pet that is allegedly affected is the proxy. Some monodelusional disorders, such as delusional infestation, have a prevalence of delusion by proxy of up to 5\%. Treatment is usually with antipsychotics. In some situations it may be necessary to remove the proxy to provide safety from the behaviour associated with the delusion. See also DOUBLE DELUSION; FOLIE Ã€ DEUX.
