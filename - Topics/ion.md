## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- When an atom has a charge, it's called an ion
	- Positively charged: [[Cation]] (fewer electrons)
	- Negatively charged: [[Anion]] (more electrons)
## Source[^2]
- $n$. an atom or group of atoms that has lost one or more electrons, making it electrically charged and therefore more chemically active. See ANION; CATION; ELECTROLYTE; IONIZATION.
## Source[^3]
- An atom or group of atoms that has either lost one or more electrons, making it positively charged (a cation), or gained one or more electrons, making it negatively charged (an anion).
## Source[^4]
- $n$. An electrically charged particle that is either a cation, having lost one or more electrons and therefore carrying a positive electrical charge, or an anion, having gained one or more electrons and therefore carrying a negative electrical charge. The movement of ions across cell membranes is the main mechanism of electrical signaling in the nervous system. See also ACTION POTENTIAL, ION CHANNEL. ionization $n$. The production of ions. ionize $v b$. To produce ions or turn into ions. \[From Greek ion going, from ienai to go]
