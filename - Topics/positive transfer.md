- $n$. A form of transfer of training in which the learning or performance of a task is facilitated or improves as a result of training on a different but related task, as when learning to speak Italian improves one's ability to speak Spanish, or vice versa. Transfer tends to be positive when the two tasks involve different stimuli and similar responses. Compare NEGATIVE TRANSFER.
