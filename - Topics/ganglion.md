- n. (pl. ganglia) 
- (1) (in neurology) any structure containing a collection of nerve cell bodies and often also numbers of synapses. In the sympathetic nervous system chains of ganglia are found on each side of the spinal cord, while in the parasympathetic system ganglia are situated in or nearer to the organs innervated. Swellings in the posterior sensory roots of the spinal nerves are termed ganglia; these contain cell bodies but no synapses. Within the central nervous system certain well-defined masses of nerve cells are called ganglia (or nuclei); for example, the basal ganglia.
- (2) an abnormal but harmless swelling (cyst) that sometimes forms in tendon sheaths, especially at the wrist.
