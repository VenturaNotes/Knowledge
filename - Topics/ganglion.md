- n. (pl. ganglia) 
- (1) (in neurology) any structure containing a collection of nerve cell bodies and often also numbers of synapses. In the sympathetic nervous system chains of ganglia are found on each side of the spinal cord, while in the parasympathetic system ganglia are situated in or nearer to the organs innervated. Swellings in the posterior sensory roots of the spinal nerves are termed ganglia; these contain cell bodies but no synapses. Within the central nervous system certain well-defined masses of nerve cells are called ganglia (or nuclei); for example, the basal ganglia.
- (2) an abnormal but harmless swelling (cyst) that sometimes forms in tendon sheaths, especially at the wrist.
## Source[^2]
- (pl. ganglia) A mass of nervous tissue containing many cell bodies and synapses, usually enclosed in a connective-tissue sheath. In vertebrates most ganglia occur outside the central nervous system; exceptions are the basal ganglia in the brain. In invertebrates ganglia occur along the nerve cords and the most anterior pair (cerebral ganglia) are analogous to the vertebrate brain; invertebrate ganglia constitute a part of the central nervous system.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A nerve-centre or collection of neuron cell bodies usually (apart from the basal ganglia and adjacent structures) located in the peripheral nervous system. See dorsal root ganglion, postganglionic, preganglionic, SYMPATHETIC GANGLIONIC CHAIN. ganglia or ganglions pl. \[From Greek ganglion a cystic tumor]
