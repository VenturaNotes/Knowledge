## Source[^2]
- A cell, such as a dendritic cell or macrophage, that 'presents' foreign antigens to $\mathrm{~T}$ cells as part of the immune response. A direct reaction between these lymphocytes and foreign antigens is not common. The antigen-presenting cell takes in the foreign protein, processes it, and then displays peptide fragments on its surface as a complex with MHC class II proteins.
