- A base station in a mobile radio system is a radio receiver that communicates with mobile stations, which connect cellular calls to a public telephone network. It can also communicate directly with other base stations and the public telephone network. Each base station covers a geographical area called a cell and belongs to a specific telecommunications company. However, rival companies can have their own base stations in the same geographical area.
