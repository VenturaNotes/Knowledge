## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Carries information received in one hemisphere over to the other and in general allows for communication between two hemispheres
- It's a large C-shaped nerve fiber bundle that stretches across the midline of the brain
	- It connects the left and right cerebral hemispheres
- Makes up largest collection of white matter found in the brain
- Patients have had their corpus callosum surgically severed to stop the spread of epileptic seizures
## Source[^2]
- the broad band of nervous tissue that connects the two cerebral hemispheres, containing an estimated 300 million fibres. See CEREBRUM.
## Source[^3]
- (pl. corpora callosa) The sweeping band (commissure) of white matter that provides a connection between the two halves of the cerebrum in the brain. It enables the transfer of information and learning from one cerebral hemisphere to the other.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. The largest bundle of nerve fibres in the nervous system, consisting of a broad curved band of more than 200 million white fibres (axons) connecting matching areas of the left and right cerebral hemispheres. The main central part is called the trunk of the corpus callosum, and the other parts are its splenium, genu, and rostrum (1). See also AGENESIS OF THE CORPUS CALLOSUM, ALIEN HAND SIGN, DISCONNECTION SYNDROME, LEFT-SIDED APRAXIA, SPLIT-BRAIN PREPARATION, TAPETUM (2). Compare ANTERIOR COMMISSURE, HIPPOCAMPAL COMMISSURE, MASSA INTERMEDIA, MIDDLE COMMISSURE, POSTERIOR CEREBRAL COMMISSURE. \[From Latin corpus a body + callosus callous]
