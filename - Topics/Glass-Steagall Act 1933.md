- US legislation that separated commercial banking and securities operations by banks. It was introduced in the aftermath of the great stock-market crash of 1929 to lessen the likelihood of such panics occurring again. These provisions of the Act were largely repealed by the Financial Services Modernization Act 1999, a move that some commentators now see as contributing to the financial crisis of 2007-08. Similar provisions were re-enacted in a weaker form as part of the Dodd-Frank Act 2010.
