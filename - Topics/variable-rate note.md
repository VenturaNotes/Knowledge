- (VRN) A bond, usually with a fixed maturity, in which the interest coupon is adjusted at regular intervals to reflect the prevailing market rate (usually a margin over the London Inter Bank Offered Rate). A VRN differs from a floating-rate note in that the margin is not fixed and will be adjusted to take into account market conditions at each coupon setting date.
