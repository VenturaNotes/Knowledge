- A frequency distribution is said to be bimodal if it shows two clear peaks. The two (local) modes need not be exactly equal, in which case the modes are referred to as major and minor modes.
## Source[^2]
- BimodalÂ describes two separate but similar work processes:
	- Mode one focuses on predictability. It's a work style that focuses on repeating an organization's past achievements. For example, an organization might re-release its most popular product onto the market.
	- Mode two is more exploratory. It's a work style that attempts to solve new problems. For example, organizations might release a new product with basic features to test customer responses for future product development.
