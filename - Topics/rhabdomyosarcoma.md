- $n$. a rare malignant tumor, usually of childhood, originating in, or showing the characteristics of, striated muscle. Pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma occurs in late middle age, in the muscles of the limbs. Embryonal rhabdomyosarcomas, affecting infants, children, and young adults, are classified as botryoid (in the vagina (see SARCOMA BOTRYOIDES), bladder, ear, etc.), embryonal (most common in the head and neck, particularly the orbit); and alveolar (at the base of the thumb). The pleomorphic and alveolar types respond poorly to treatment; botryoid tumours are treated with a combination of radiotherapy, surgery, and drugs. The embryonal type, if treated at an early stage, can often be cured with a combination of radiotherapy and drugs (including vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide).
