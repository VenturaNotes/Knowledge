- A form of integrated circuit packaging, capable of providing up to several hundred connections to one chip. Connections to the device are made by means of an array of pins underneath the package. The array may be formed as several parallel rows of pins at two opposite sides of the package or around all four sides, depending on the size and complexity of the IC.
