- $n$. in ethics, a rule, principle, or law used to direct or guide one's actions. Kantian ethics distinguishes between categorical and hypothetical imperatives. Whereas the latter are merely prudent or expedient and will vary with circumstances, the former are binding moral duties and it is rational that they are applicable to all situations and people. See also DEONTOLOGY.
