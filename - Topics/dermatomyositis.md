- $n$. an inflammatory disorder of the skin and underlying tissues, including the muscles (in the absence of a rash it is known as polymyositis). The condition is one of the connective-tissue diseases. A pink/purple skin eruption occurs on the face, scalp, neck, shoulders, and knuckles (known as Gottron's papules) and is later accompanied by severe swelling (see also Heliotrope RASH). Dermatomyositis is often associated with internal cancer in adults, though not in children.
