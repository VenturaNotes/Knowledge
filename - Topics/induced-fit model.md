- A proposed mechanism of interaction between an enzyme and a substrate. It postulates that exposure of an enzyme to a substrate causes the active site of the enzyme to change shape in order to allow the enzyme and substrate to bind (see ENZYMEsubstrate COMPlex). This description is generally preferred to the lock-and-key mechanism.
