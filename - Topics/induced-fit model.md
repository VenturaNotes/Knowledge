- A proposed mechanism of interaction between an enzyme and a substrate. It postulates that exposure of an enzyme to a substrate causes the active site of the enzyme to change shape in order to allow the enzyme and substrate to bind (see enzyme-substrate complex). This description is generally preferred to the lock-and-key mechanism.
