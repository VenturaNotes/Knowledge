- The development cycle is the process of designing, developing, testing, and deploying software. It usually includes phases like planning, design, implementation (coding), testing, deployment, and maintenance.
	- #question how is software deployed. Are dockers the only way to do this?
- The full SDLC usually includes these phases:
	- Planning – Define project goals, feasibility, and scope.
	- Requirements Analysis – Gather and document functional and non-functional requirements.
	- Design – Create system architecture, database models, and UI/UX designs.
		- #question What would design look like? What is system architecture? What are database models? What does UI and UX stand for?
	- Implementation (Coding) – Developers write the actual code.
	- Testing – Conduct unit, integration, system, and acceptance testing.
		- #question Give me in detail what these 
	- Deployment – Release the software to users.
		- #question how does deployment work? Where is the software being released to?
	- Maintenance & Support – Fix bugs, update features, and optimize performance post-release.
		- #question How can updates be pushed without building the entire software or application again?
