- Statistical process control (SPC) involves using statistics to improve processes or end-products. It is meant to be applied to areas where production occurs, specifically to identify weak points in a production process and also to remedy these issues.
## Source[^2]
- (SPC) A technique for checking whether or not a product or service is conforming to its design specification, by means of sampling during production or delivery. Small variations in the output of a process are inevitable. For example, when cutting a machine part slight changes in material hardness, operating temperature, etc., will cause dimensions to vary very slightly. Using statistical techniques, SPC defines the limits of these variations that can be accepted. Provided sampled outputs stay within this range the process is in control. See CONTROL CHART.
