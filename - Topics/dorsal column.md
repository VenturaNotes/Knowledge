- $n$. A column of nerve fibres, including the fasciculus cuneatus and fasciculus gracilis, lying dorsally in the posterior funiculus of each lateral half of the spinal cord, conveying sensations of touch and proprioception. It is one of two major routes by which afferent spinal nerve fibres carrying sensations of somaesthesis are transmitted to the thalamus. Compare SPINOTHALAMIC TRACT.
