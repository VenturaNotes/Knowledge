- A Private Exchange (PX) refers to a telephone exchange that is private, with its use limited to one specific organization. A PX doesn't connect to the public telephone network but allows employees within the same business to reach each other quickly and at a lower cost because fewer phone lines are needed. For example, an employee in the HR department may phone an employee in accounting by simply dialing their extension number. This facilitates cross-business communication.
