- A diameter of a circle or central conic is a line through the center. If the line meets the circle or central conic at P and Q, then the line segment PQ may also be called a diameter. The term also applies in both senses to a sphere or central quadric. 
- In the case of a circle or sphere, all such line segments have the same length. This length is also called the diameter of the circle or sphere, and is equal to twice the radius.
