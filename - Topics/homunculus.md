- $n$. A tiny man, especially the completed homunculus depicting the surface of the human body, with each part drawn in proportion to its representation in the somatosensory cortex (see illustration), or the somatosensory homunculus often used to depict the layout of the sensory projection areas of the somatosensory cortex. The term was formerly used to denote the minute but fully formed human form that was believed by the preformationists to be present in every spermatozoon or ovum. \[From Latin homunculus a little man, diminutive of homo a man]
