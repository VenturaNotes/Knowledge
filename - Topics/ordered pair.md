## Source [^1]
- Given a solution for a [[system of linear equations]], the final solution is typically written as an ordered pair such as (3, 5) if we have two lines. 
## Source[^2]
- An ordered pair consists of two objects considered in a particular order. Thus, if $a \ne b$, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ does not equal the ordered pair $(b, a)$. See CARTESIAN PRODUCT, PAIR.

## Source[^3]
- A pair of objects in a given fixed order, usually represented by$$(x, y) \text { or }(x, y)$$for objects $x$ and $y$. Two ordered pairs are said to be equal if and only if the first elements of each pair are equal and the second elements are equal. Typical situations in which ordered pairs are used include discussion of points in the Cartesian plane or complex numbers.
- The idea can be extended to cover ordered triples, such as$$\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}\right)$$and indeed ordered $n$-tuples, such as$$\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots x_{n}\right)$$
