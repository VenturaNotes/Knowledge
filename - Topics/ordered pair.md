## Source [^1]
- Given a solution for a [[system of linear equations]], the final solution is typically written as an ordered pair such as (3, 5) if we have two lines. 
## Source[^2]
- An ordered pair consists of two objects considered in a particular order. Thus, if $a \ne b$, the ordered pair $(a, b)$ does not equal the ordered pair $(b, a)$. See CARTESIAN PRODUCT, PAIR.
