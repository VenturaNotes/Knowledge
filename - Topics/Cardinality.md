## Synthesis
- Number of elements in a set
- Several symbols used to denote it
	- $|B| = n(B) = \# B$
## Source[^1]
- Denoted $|B| = n(B) = \# B = 4$

## Source[^2]
- Can be written as
	- $|A \cup B|$
	- $n (A \cup B)$
## Source[^3]
- Formula for [[intersection of sets]]
	- $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$

## Source[^4]
- $P = \{p | \text{ p is a prime} \}$
	- |P| = $\infty$

### Size vs Cardinality
- These terms are often used interchangeably in mathematics when discussing sets. However, `size` is more casual and less precise while `cardinality` is the specific term used in set theory and formal mathematics. 
### What is Cardinality
- Cardinality is a precise mathematical concept that quantifies the number of elements in a set, often denoted by |A| for a set A
- For [[finite sets]], cardinality is just the count of elements.
- For [[infinite sets]], cardinality captures the "type" or "degree" of infinity. It is a more rigorous way of comparing the sizes of sets, especially infinite ones. 
#### Examples
- The set of [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$ and the set of even natural numbers $2\mathbb{N}$ have the same cardinality because there is a [[bijection|one-to-one correspondence]] between them $(n \mapsto 2n)$

## Source[^6]
- The number of (distinct) elements in a set.

## Source[^7]
- A measure of the size of a set. Two sets $S$ and $T$ have the same cardinality if there is a bijection from one to the other. $S$ and $T$ are said to be equipotent, often written as $S \sim T$. If the set $S$ is finite, then the cardinality of $S$ is the number of elements in the set. For an infinite set $S$, the idea of 'number' of elements no longer suffices. An important fact, discovered by Cantor, is that not all infinite sets have the same cardinality. The two most important 'grades' of infinite set can be illustrated as follows.

  

If $S$ is equipotent to the set of natural numbers

$\{1,2,3, \ldots\}$

then $S$ is said to have cardinality $\aleph_{0}$ (a symbol called [[aleph null]]).

If $S$ is equipotent to the set of real numbers then $S$ is said to have cardinality $\mathbf{C}$, or cardinality of the continuum. It can be shown that in some sense

  

$$

C=2^{\aleph 0}

$$

  

since the real numbers can be put in bijective correspondence with the set of all subsets of natural numbers.
## Source[^8]
- For a finite set $A$, the cardinality of $A$, denoted by $|A|$, is the number of elements in $A$. The notation $\# A$ or $n(A)$ is also used. For sets $A, B$,$$||A \cup B||=||A||+||B||-||A \cap B|| .$$See also INCLUSION-EXCLUSION PRINCIPLE.
