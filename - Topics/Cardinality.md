## Synthesis
- Number of elements in a set
- Several symbols used to denote it
	- $|B| = n(B) = \# B$
## Source[^1]
- Denoted $|B| = n(B) = \# B = 4$

## Source[^2]
- Can be written as
	- $|A \cup B|$
	- $n (A \cup B)$
## Source[^3]
- Formula for [[intersection of sets]]
	- $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$

## Source[^4]
- $P = \{p | \text{ p is a prime} \}$
	- |P| = $\infty$

### Size vs Cardinality
- These terms are often used interchangeably in mathematics when discussing sets. However, `size` is more casual and less precise while `cardinality` is the specific term used in set theory and formal mathematics. 
### What is Cardinality
- Cardinality is a precise mathematical concept that quantifies the number of elements in a set, often denoted by |A| for a set A
- For [[finite sets]], cardinality is just the count of elements.
- For [[infinite sets]], cardinality captures the "type" or "degree" of infinity. It is a more rigorous way of comparing the sizes of sets, especially infinite ones. 
#### Examples
- The set of [[natural numbers]] $\mathbb{N}$ and the set of even natural numbers $2\mathbb{N}$ have the same cardinality because there is a [[one-to-one correspondence]] between them $(n \mapsto 2n)$
