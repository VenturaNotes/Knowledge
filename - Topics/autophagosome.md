## Source [^1]
- Double-membrane vesicles newly formed during autophagy to engulf a wide range of intracellular material and transport this autophagic cargo to lysosomes (or vacuoles in yeasts and plants) for subsequent degradation

## Source[^2]
- A spherical vesicle that contains a double membrane and transports cytoplasmic components to lysosomes for degradation
- A key part of [[macroautophagy]], or autophagy, a process that removes unnecessary or dysfunctional components of a cell
