- A worker who is supplied to an employer by an agency, usually on a temporary or contingent basis. Such workers are sometimes said to have a 'triangular' working relationship, in that they do their work for the client but are paid by the agency: they may have a contract with either, both, or neither. Because they have often found it difficult to prove that they are employees of either the agency or the client, agency workers have tended to lack employment protection. In order to decide whether such a worker is an employee the courts have looked for a regular pattern of mutual obligations between the parties. Regulations passed in 2003 and 2010 aim to ensure that agency workers are protected against exploitation; such workers now have a right to the same working and employment conditions as employees where they have undertaken the same role with the same hirer for 12 or more continuous weeks. They do not, however, have a right to claim unfair dismissal. See also CONTINGENT WORKER; TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE.
