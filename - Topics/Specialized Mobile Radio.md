- SMR is a type of two-way radio system used by many industries. It's an alternative to standard cell phone communication. Two or more receivers are linked on a single network. This allows secure communication between members of a team, or different members of a particular organization. This type of communication system can be either digital or analog. Users may have special dialing codes for additional security.
