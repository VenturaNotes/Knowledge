- Time spent not working. In many economic models leisure is regarded as a consumption good from which utility is derived. The measurement of leisure raises questions about whether time spent travelling to work if employed, or looking for work if unemployed, should be counted. The provision of leisure facilities, including cultural activities, sport, and entertainments, is a major sector in modern economies.
