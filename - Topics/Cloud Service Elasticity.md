- Cloud service elasticity describes the ability of a cloud service to expand or contract system capacity (memory, storage, etc.) as needed. This feature is essential for businesses that experience fluctuating workloads, allowing them to pay only for the resources they use at any given time. Certain cloud-based services have limitations and may not be able to scale up when needed. Therefore, businesses must evaluate their current and future needs before choosing a cloud service provider.
