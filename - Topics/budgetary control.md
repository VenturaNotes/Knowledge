- The process by which financial control is exercised within an organization. Budgets for income and expenditure for each function of the organization are prepared in advance of an accounting period and are then compared with actual performance to establish any variances. Individual function managers are made responsible for the controllable costs within their budgets, and are expected to take remedial action if the adverse variances are regarded as excessive.
