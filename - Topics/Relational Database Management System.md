- A Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) is a program that allows users to manage data in a relational database. It lets organizations access information quickly, compare data like for like and identify trends and patterns within many data sets. Other benefits include better data quality, support for multiple users, and the ability to handle large amounts of data.
- An RDBMS lets SMBs maintain the security, accuracy, and integrity of data in a relational database. Unlike other database management systems, an RDBMS doesn't require complicated tasks such as data structuring and querying, making it useful for SMBs without a data engineering team.
