- (Informal) A popular term used to distinguish interactive websites such as blogs, forums, and social media from earlier (pre-2000) uses of the World Wide Web, which tended to publish content with little or no participation from users. This earlier use is sometimes referred to retrospectively as web 1.0. The term web 2.0 does not mark any technical evolution of the Web, but rather a trend in the usage of available web services.
