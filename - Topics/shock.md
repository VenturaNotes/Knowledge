- In economics, an unexpected and unpredictable event that has a positive or a negative effect on the economy. A shock is said to be permanent if it has a long-run effect, for example, economic effects of major geographical discoveries or major technical developments; otherwise it is said to be transitory: for example, monetary or fiscal policy changes may have no long-run effect on real income. See also ADVERSE SUPPLY SHOCK.

- $n$. the condition associated with circulatory collapse, when the arterial blood pressure is too low to maintain an adequate supply of blood to the tissues. The patient has a cold sweaty pallid skin, a weak rapid pulse, irregular breathing, dry mouth, dilated pupils, a decreased level of consciousness, and a reduced flow of urine.
- Hypovolaemic shock is due to a decrease in the volume of blood, as occurs after internal or external haemorrhage, burns, dehydration, or severe vomiting or diarrhoea. Cardiogenic shock results from reduced activity of the heart, as in coronary thrombosis, myocardial infarction, or pulmonary embolism. Shock may also be due to widespread dilatation of the blood vessels so that there is insufficient blood to fill them. This is the case in severe sepsis (septic, bacteraemic, or toxic shock), with a resultant systemic inflammatory response associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ failure. Vasodilatation may also be caused by a severe allergic reaction (anaphylactic shock: see ANAPHYLAXIS), overdosage with such drugs as opioids or barbiturates, or the emotional shock due to a personal tragedy or disaster (neurogenic shock). Sometimes shock may result from a combination of any of these causes, as in peritonitis. The treatment of shock is determined by the cause.
