- $n$. a brain tumor, situated above the sella turcica, that is derived from remnants of Rathke's pouch, the earliest detectable embryonic precursor of the pituitary gland. The patient may show raised intracranial pressure and diabetes insipidus due to reduced secretion of the hormone vasopressin. An X-ray of the skull typically shows calcification within the tumour and loss of the normal skull structure around the pituitary gland.
