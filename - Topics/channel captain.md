- (channel leader) The most powerful member in the distribution channel of goods. The channel consists of the manufacturer, wholesaler, and retailer, the channel captain usually being the manufacturer. There are, however, exceptions, most notably when the retailer is a major department store or chain, whose buying power enables it to become the channel captain. The channel captain controls the distribution channel and can insist that products should be made to their own specifications. See also CHANNEL CONFLICT.
