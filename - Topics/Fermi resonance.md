- A shift in the energy levels and intensities between vibrational states in infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy (see R ); it is caused by two vibrational states of a molecule having the same symmetry and very similar energy differences. The phenomenon of Fermi resonances was analyzed by Enrico Fermi in the early 1930s.
