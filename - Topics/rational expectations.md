- The macroeconomic theory, developed since the 1960s by John F. Muth and others, that economic transactors make unbiased forecasts on the basis of all the information available. This means that although forecasts may be right or wrong, agents do not make systematic forecasting errors. Such an assumption is central to the efficient markets hypothesis. More recently, the theory of rational expectations has been challenged by behavioral finance. Compare ADAPTIVE EXPECTATIONS.
