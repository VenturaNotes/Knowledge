## Source[^2]
- Describing an organism that lives and grows optimally at extremely high temperatures, typically over $40^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The majority are prokaryotes, such as the archaea found in hot springs and in undersea hydrothermal vents (thermoacidophils); some of these (called hyperthermophiles) thrive at temperatures above $80^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ and can even survive at temperatures above the boiling point of water. Some eukaryotes, especially certain protists and fungi, are capable of surviving temperatures up to about $60^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. Thermophiles have various adaptations in order to thrive at such high temperatures. For example, their proteins and nucleic acids have structural modifications that give them much greater heat stability, so that the cell machinery is able to function. Also, the chemical makeup of their cell membranes is adapted, for example by inclusion of lipids rich in saturated fatty acids. Compare MESOPHILIC; PSYCHROPHILIC.
