- A detailed study of a particular job, the tools and equipment needed to do it, and its relation to other jobs in an organization. The analysis should also provide the information needed to say how the job should best be done and the qualifications, experience, or aptitudes of the person best suited to doing it. Data is usually collected by questioning those already doing or supervising the job and is subjected to various forms of interpretation by a job analyst. Accurate job analysis is crucial to effective job evaluation, employee evaluation, and personnel selection. See also JOB DESCRIPTION; JOB DIMENSIONS.
