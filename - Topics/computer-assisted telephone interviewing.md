- (CATI) A system in which a telephone interviewer conducts a sales or marketing interview, using a computer and a computerized questionnaire. This system reduces the number of errors as the interviewer keys in the respondent's answers as they are given and the computer follows a complex questionnaire routing efficiently, enabling the required statistics to be extracted automatically.
