- A promise to pay general average contributions, if required. If a general-average loss occurs during a marine voyage the carrier has a right to take part of the cargo as payment of the cargo owners' contribution to the loss. As an alternative to the possibility of losing part of the cargo, the cargo owner may take out an average bond with insurers, who agree to pay any losses arising in this way.
