- A variable which is not a factor being considered in an observational study or experiment but which may be at least partially responsible for the observed outcomes. Experimental design methods use randomization to minimize the effect of confounding variables, but that is not possible in observational studies. The possibility of one or more confounding variables is one of the biggest problems in trying to makes inferences based on observational studies.
