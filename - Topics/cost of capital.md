- The rate of return an enterprise has to offer to induce investors to provide it with capital. The cost of loan capital is the rate of interest that has to be paid. The cost of equity capital is the expected yield needed to induce investors to buy shares. When a firm uses both methods of raising capital, its cost of capital is the average of the costs of capital raised by the two methods, weighted by the proportion of funds raised in each way. The cost of capital depends on the apparent riskiness of the purpose for which it is to be used, the collateral offered for any loans, and the overall financial soundness and reputation of the borrower.

- The return, expressed in terms of an interest rate, that an organization is required to pay for the capital used in financing its activities. This will vary according to the type or types of capital employed (e.g., equity capital, loan capital, or some mixture of the two). One approach to establishing the cost of capital is therefore to compute a unique weighted average cost of capital for each organization, based on its particular mix of capital sources. The cost of capital is often used as a hurdle rate in discounted cash flow calculations.
