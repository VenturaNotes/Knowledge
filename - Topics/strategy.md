- A combination of moves for a player in a game. In some games, a strategy can be decided by the current state of the game$\textemdash$such as in noughts and crosses. In other games, like poker, a variation in approach over a number of games is required so the other players cannot identify your hand simply by your moves. In game theory this is modeled by a probability distribution on the available choices. See MIXED STRATEGY.
