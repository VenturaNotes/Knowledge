- (1) (of a computer network) A rather loosely defined property referring either to the extent to which sites wishing to connect to the network are actually equipped with a network connection, or to the extent to which sites with an existing connection are still able to contact other network sites in the event of a component failure. 
- (2) (of a graph $G)$ The minimum number of vertices (and associated edges) of $G$ whose removal from $G$ results either in a graph that is no longer connected or in a trivial graph with a single vertex: at least $k$ vertices must be removed from a graph with $k$-connectivity. The higher the connectivity the more edges there are joining vertices.
- The quantity described above is sometimes called the vertex connectivity to distinguish it from the edge connectivity, which by analogy is the minimum number of edges whose removal from $G$ results in a graph that is disconnected or trivial.
