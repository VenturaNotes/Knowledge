- A program of technology transfer and software process improvement within ESPRIT III. As distinct from the main body of ESPRIT, which supported R\&D projects, ESSI had the goal of improving software development practice in industry and business. The Framework IV Programme, 1995-99 (see ESPRIT), included a continuation of ESSI under the name Software Best Practice.
