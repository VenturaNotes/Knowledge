- A flat rectangular device that responds to the touch of, say, a finger by transmitting the coordinates of the touched point to a computer. The touch-sensitive area may be the screen itself, in which case it is called a touchscreen. Alternatively it may be integral with the keyboard or a separate unit that can be placed on a desk: movement of the finger across the so-called [[touchpad]] can cause the cursor to move around the screen.
