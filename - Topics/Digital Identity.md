- A digital identity is the information provided online about an individual or organization. The body of information that helps to construct a digital identity is username and password, consumer interests, date of birth, social security number, medical history, and more. By providing this information about yourself or your organization, the internet will begin to track you and your activity on the web or social media to personalize your digital experience. For example, if one day a user Google searches “best organic household cleaning products,” over the course of the next few days that user will find that advertisements for organic household cleaning products will appear on their screen while online or in their social media feed. Since a digital identity is most often created including real aspects of a person’s life, identity theft can occur, making it important to secure your identity online with security questions or identity authentication.
