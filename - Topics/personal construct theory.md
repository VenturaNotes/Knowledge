- $n$. A theory of personality, formulated by the US psychologist George A(lexander) Kelly (1905-67) and published in his book The Psychology of Personal Constructs (1955), according to which people think like incipient scientists in construing their worlds, constantly formulating hypotheses and testing their predictions against experience. The fundamental postulate of the theory is that 'a person's processes are psychologically channelized by the ways in which he anticipates events' (Vol. 1, p. 46), and this postulate is extended by eleven corollaries, including the individuality corollary: 'Persons differ from each other in their construction of events' (p. 55), and the dichotomy corollary: 'A person's construction system is composed of a finite number of dichotomous constructs' (p. 59), a dichotomous construct being a way of construing reality such that any pair of elements of experience may be classified as being either similar or different. Personal constructs are elicited and studied with the help of the Repertory Grid Test. The theory interprets emotion as follows: threat is an awareness of an imminent comprehensive change in one's core constructs when they appear inadequate; anxiety is an awareness of the existence of important elements that lie outside the range of convenience of one's construct system; guilt is an awareness of being dislodged from one's core role structure; and hostility is an effort to extort validational evidence in favor of a social prediction that has already failed. Two treatment techniques based on personal construct theory are fixed-role therapy and personal construct therapy. PCT abbrev.
