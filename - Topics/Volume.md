- A logical unit of data storage. A volume can be a single unit of a physical storage medium (e.g. one fixed disk may be a single volume), but it can correspond to part of a physical unit (e.g. one of several partitions on a fixed disk) or to more than one physical unit (e.g. multiple partitions on several fixed disks).
