- A logical unit of data storage. A volume can be a single unit of a physical storage medium (e.g. one fixed disk may be a single volume), but it can correspond to part of a physical unit (e.g. one of several partitions on a fixed disk) or to more than one physical unit (e.g. multiple partitions on several fixed disks).

- (1) The space occupied by something. 
- (2) A measure of the amount of trade that has taken place, usually in a specified period. On the London Stock Exchange, for example, the number of shares traded in a day is called the volume, and the value of these shares is called the turnover. In commodity markets, the daily volume is usually the number of lots traded in a day.
