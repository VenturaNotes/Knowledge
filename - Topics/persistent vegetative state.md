- (PVS) the condition that may be diagnosed after a patient has been in the vegetative state for more than 4 weeks and is normally regarded as permanent, with little or no hope of recovery, after 12 months. Following the high-profile case of Tony Bland, who was in PVS following injuries sustained in the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster, the law currently allows medical treatment, such as artificial nutrition and hydration, to be withdrawn from patients in a permanent vegetative state, but permission must first be granted by the courts.
