- (PVS) the condition that may be diagnosed after a patient has been in the vegetative state for more than 4 weeks and is normally regarded as permanent, with little or no hope of recovery, after 12 months. Following the high-profile case of Tony Bland, who was in PVS following injuries sustained in the Hillsborough Football Stadium disaster, the law currently allows medical treatment, such as artificial nutrition and hydration, to be withdrawn from patients in a permanent vegetative state, but permission must first be granted by the courts.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A generally irreversible condition resulting from severe brain damage in which a person is alive, has spontaneous breathing, heartbeat, and sleep-wake cycle, but is incapable of voluntary movement and is judged to lack conscious awareness. People in such a state can make spontaneous movements such as swallowing, smiling, crying, grasping, and moaning, and in rare cases may briefly follow moving objects with their eyes or turn towards loud sounds, but these movements are always reflexive and not purposeful. Also called persistent vegetative syndrome or (especially if it has not persisted for long) a vegetative state. Compare LOCKED-IN SYNDROME. PVS abbrev.
