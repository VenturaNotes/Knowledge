- An algorithm for evaluating a polynomial by adding brackets in such a way that no powers greater than one need be evaluated. This reduces the number of evaluations. The polynomial, in effect, ends up in the following form:

  

$$

\begin{aligned}

& p(x)=[\ldots((a n x+a(n-1)) x+ \\

& a(n-2)) x \ldots a 0 x+a 0

\end{aligned}

$$
