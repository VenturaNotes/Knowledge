- An international mobile equipment identity (IMEI) number is a unique number given to any device that uses the global system for mobile communications, or GSM. Most cellular network providers in the world use GSM. IMEIs consist of 15 digits, and phone carriers and manufacturers use these numbers to track stolen and compromised devices. Carriers can block an IMEI so the person using the associated device can't make calls or access network services.
