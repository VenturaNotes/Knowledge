- A theory of chemical reactions in solutions proposed by the Dutch physicist Hendrik Anthony ('Hans') Kramers (1894-1952) in 1940. In this theory the energy required to reach a transition state is governed by Brownian motion of the solvent molecules. Experimental support for Kramers' reaction rate theory came in the 1970s and 1980s
