- A process that aims to help organizations understand, evaluate, and take action on all their risks. A private-sector organization will need to identify and evaluate the trade-off between risk and expected return and to choose the course of action that will help it to maximize its value. Risk management is also relevant to the public sector. Common forms of risk management include taking out insurance against possible losses and the use of derivatives to hedge against changes in interest rates, exchange rates, or other economic variables. A bank will always try to manage the risks involved in lending by adjusting the level of charges and interest rates to compensate for a percentage of losses.
