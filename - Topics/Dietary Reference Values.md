	- LRNI lowest recommended nutrient intake: the amount of a nutrient that provides only $2.5 \%$ of the population with their requirements.
	- RNI reference nutrient intake: the amount that is sufficient for almost $97.5 \%$ of individuals in a population. It is the term usually used when expressing dietary requirements.
	- safe level: used when there is insufficient data to determine the RNI, set as the average requirement plus $20 \%$.
