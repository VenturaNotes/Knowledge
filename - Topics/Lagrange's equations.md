- For a mechanical system with $n$ degrees of freedom in which conservative forces act and all constraints are holonomic, the Lagrangian is $L = T-V$, where $T$ denotes kinetic energy and $V$ denotes potential energy. For a light pendulum of length $l$ with a mass $m$ at the end and making an angle $\theta$ with the downward vertical, $$L = \frac 12ml^2\dot \theta^2 + mgl \space cos\theta.$$For such a system, defined by generalized coordinates $q_1, q_2, ..., q_n$, Lagrange's equations state that $$\frac {d}{dt} (\frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot q_i}) - \frac{\partial L}{\partial q_i} = 0 \quad \text{for }1 \le i \le n.$$In the example of the pendulum, this gives $$0 = \frac{d}{dt}(ml^2\theta)+mglsin\theta=ml^2\ddot \theta + mglsin\theta.$$See also HAMILTONIAN MECHANICS
