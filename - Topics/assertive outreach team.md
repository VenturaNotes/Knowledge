- (AOT) a multidisciplinary psychiatric team specialized in the treatment of patients with severe mental illness who are difficult to engage. Most AOTs will only see patients who have had a number of recent hospital admissions ('revolving door' patients). Recently, in many areas of the UK AOTs have been subsumed into community mental health teams.
