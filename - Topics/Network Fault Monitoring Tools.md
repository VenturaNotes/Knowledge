- Network fault monitoring tools monitor networks for issues that can lead to network faults or outages. These tools measure the status of network components such as switches and routers and how network components interact with each other. They can also track VPNs and network interfaces. Most tools let users visualize network-related information in the form of graphs and charts, making it easier to identify potential issues and fix any problems to avoid a network fault or outage.
