- The London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange. A financial futures market opened in 1982, in London's Royal Exchange, to provide facilities within the European time zone for dealing in options and futures contracts, including those in government bonds, share indexes, foreign currencies, and interest rates. In 1991 LIFFE moved into its own premises in the City of London. The London Traded Options Market merged with LIFFE in 1992, when the words 'and Options' was added to its full name, although the familiar acronym (pronounced 'lifey') remained unchanged. Electronic trading via the LIFFE CONNECT system was introduced in 1989 but did not replace live pit trading until 1998. In 1996 LIFFE merged with the London Commodity Exchange, making it the first exchange to provide futures and options contracts on financial, equity, and commodity products and equity indices. In 2002 it became part of the pan-European exchange Euronext NV (itself subsequently part of NYSE Euronext), and was renamed, Euronext.liffe. After a further takeover in 2012 the LIFFE became part of the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) group and is now effectively integrated with ICE Futures Europe. Euronext.liffe.
