## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a hormone produced by stomach cells that increases appetite and stimulates secretion of growth hormone (levels increase before meals and decrease thereafter). Its receptors and site of action are in the hypothalamus. Ghrelin levels are lower in obese individuals (suggesting that the hormone does not stimulate eating) and higher in patients with anorexia nervosa.
## Source[^2]
- A peptide hormone that is secreted chiefly by cells in the stomach lining when the stomach is empty, and increases hunger by stimulating the release of neuropeptide Y, a potent stimulant of appetite, from the arcuate nucleus in the hypothalamus. It also stimulates release of growth hormone by binding to receptors (called growth hormone secretagogue receptors) in the anterior pituitary. Ghrelin thus opposes the appetite-suppressive effects of the hormones insulin, leptin, and peptide YY. It is synthesized as a prohormone and processed to yield a 28-amino-acid peptide modified by the addition of $n$-octanoic acid. The concentration of ghrelin in blood rises during the fasting period before a meal, thereby promoting appetite. Paradoxically, it also appears to suppress the mobilization of fat reserves in adipose tissue. Its role in regulating the body's energy balance has prompted interest in ghrelin as a potential target for anti-obesity treatments.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A peptide hormone, produced by endocrine cells of the stomach, that acts in the brain to increase food intake and body weight by stimulating hunger and triggering release of growth hormone from the pituitary gland. Its discovery was reported in an article by the Japanese molecular geneticist Masayasu Kojima (born 1959) and several colleagues in the journal Nature in 1999. Compare Leptin. \[From ghre- the Proto-Indo-European root of the word grow + Latin -in indicating an organic or chemical substance]
