- $n$. a hormone produced by stomach cells that increases appetite and stimulates secretion of growth hormone (levels increase before meals and decrease thereafter). Its receptors and site of action are in the hypothalamus. Ghrelin levels are lower in obese individuals (suggesting that the hormone does not stimulate eating) and higher in patients with anorexia nervosa.
