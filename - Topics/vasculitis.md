- (angiitis) n. (pl. vasculitides) a patchy inflammation of the walls of blood vessels that leads to damage and thrombosis. It can occur on its own (primary vasculitis) or in association with other conditions, for example rheumatoid arthritis. All the organs in the body can be affected but common symptoms include skin rashes, arthritis, headaches, breathlessness, and kidney failure. Treatment with corticosteroids or immunosuppressant drugs may be beneficial.
