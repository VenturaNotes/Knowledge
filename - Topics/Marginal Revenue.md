- marginal revenue The increase in total revenue when the quantity sold increases by a small amount, measured per unit of the increase in sales. If the seller is a price-taker, marginal revenue is equal to price. Where the seller faces a downward-sloping demand curve, where $p$ is price and $y$ is quantity sold, and the elasticity of demand is defined as $\varepsilon_{d}=-(p / y)(d y / d p)$, marginal revenue is$$M R=\frac{d R}{d y}=y \frac{d p}{d y}+p=p\left[1-\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{d}}\right]$$Positive marginal revenue thus requires that $\varepsilon_{d}>1$.
