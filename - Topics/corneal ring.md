- a ring designed to be inserted into the peripheral tissue of the cornea in order to alter the curvature of the corneal surface. It is undergoing trials to assess its ability to correct errors of refraction. In myopia (shortsightedness), for example, the ring would be required to stretch the corneal tissue peripherally and thus flatten the central corneal curvature in order to correct the myopia.
