## Source[^2]
- A widely accepted model for the mechanism of muscle contraction in which the actin and myosin filaments of striated muscle slide over each other to shorten the length of the muscle fibres (see SARCOMERE). Myosin-binding sites on the actin filaments are exposed when calcium ions bind to troponin molecules in these filaments. This allows bridges to form between actin and myosin, which requires ATP as an energy source. Hydrolysis of ATP in the heads of the myosin molecules causes the heads to change shape and bind to the actin filaments. The release of ADP from the myosin heads causes a further change in shape and generates mechanical energy that causes the actin and myosin filaments to slide over one another (see illustration).
