- $n$. A choice between two or more equally attractive goals, one of the three main types of conflict identified in 1931 by the German-US psychologist Kurt Lewin (1890-1947), though he did not name any of the types. He published his classification in a monograph that was translated into English and issued in 1935 under the title A Dynamic Theory of Personality. Lewin mentioned Buridan's ass as a typical example of this type of conflict. See also APPROACH-AVOIDANCE CONFLICT, AVOIDANCE-AVOIDANCE CONFLICT.
