- The estimated value of assets of a bank adjusted for risk. This is calculated as the weighted sum of all assets on the balance sheet of the bank, with the weights for each underlying asset corresponding to its risk. The weights are determined according to the approach developed by the Basel Committee of the Bank for International Settlements.
