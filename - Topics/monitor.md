## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Traditional monitors and keyboards use the [[simplex transmission mode]]. The monitor can only generate the output, and the keyboard can only introduce an input in the system.

## Source[^2]
- (1) A device that is used for checking the progress and operation of a system. A display and keyboard may be used in the roles of both a control console and a monitor. Display screens without keyboards may be used as remote monitors to allow the status of the system to be observed from remote locations. 
- (2) Another name for supervisor, or even a complete operating system. 
- (3) A programming construct devised by Hoare to allow controlled sharing of resources by otherwise asynchronous processes, and involving the provision of controlled passing of variables between the processes.
