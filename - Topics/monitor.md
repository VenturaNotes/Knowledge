## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Traditional monitors and keyboards use the [[simplex transmission mode]]. The monitor can only generate the output, and the keyboard can only introduce an input in the system.

## Source[^2]
- (1) A device that is used for checking the progress and operation of a system. A display and keyboard may be used in the roles of both a control console and a monitor. Display screens without keyboards may be used as remote monitors to allow the status of the system to be observed from remote locations. 
- (2) Another name for supervisor, or even a complete operating system. 
- (3) A programming construct devised by Hoare to allow controlled sharing of resources by otherwise asynchronous processes, and involving the provision of controlled passing of variables between the processes.

## Source[^3]
- formerly, an independent body set up under the Health and Social Care Act 2003 to authorize, monitor, and regulate foundation trusts. Monitor's remit was substantially expanded under the Health and Social Care Act 2012 to include regulation of all providers of health-care services for the NHS. Monitor also set prices for NHS-funded care in partnership with NHS England, protected essential health services for patients if an NHS provider entered financial difficulty, and held responsibilities for enabling integrated care and preventing anticompetitive behavior by health-care providers. In 2016 the functions of Monitor were transferred to a new organization, NHS Improvement.
