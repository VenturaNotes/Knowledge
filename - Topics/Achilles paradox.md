- The paradox of Zeno which arises from considering how overtaking takes place. Achilles gives a tortoise a head start in a race. To overtake, he must reach the tortoise's initial position, then where the tortoise had moved to, and so on ad infinitum. However, the conclusion that he cannot overtake because he has to cover an infinite sum of well-defined non-zero distances is false, because the infinite series of distances traveled and times taken both have finite sums
