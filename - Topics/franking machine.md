- A machine supplied to businesses who wish to frank their own mail. Instead of taking mail to a post office and using gummed stamps, the business uses the machine to print the postage and the date. Some machines will automatically gauge the weight and size of an item and price it accordingly. The machine records the amount of money due, which has to be remitted to the Royal Mail.
