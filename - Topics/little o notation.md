- Notation for comparing the relative order of functions. We write $f(x) = o(g(x))$ if $f(x)/g(x)$ approaches 0 as $x \to \infty$, so, for example, $(x+1)(x+2) = o(x^3)$. The notation is also used in the neighborhood of finite values; for example, $sinx = x + o(x^2)$ denotes the fact that $(sinx-x)/x^2$ approaches $0$ as $x \to 0$. Compare Big O Notation.
