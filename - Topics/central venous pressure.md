- (CVP) the pressure of blood within the right atrium. Measurement of CVP is obtained by catheterization of the right side of the heart; the catheter is attached to a manometer. CVP measurements are used to estimate circulatory function and blood volume in cases of shock or severe haemorrhage and to monitor blood replacement. In a recumbent patient, with the zero point of the manometer level with the mid-axilla (center of the armpit), CVP should measure between 5 and 8 cm saline under normal conditions. In clinical practice the CVP is often estimated by inspecting the jugular venous pressure (JVP).
