- $n$. a blood vessel carrying blood away from the heart. All arteries except the pulmonary artery carry oxygenated blood. The walls of arteries contain smooth muscle fibres, which contract or relax under the control of the sympathetic nervous system. See illustrations. See also AORTA; ARTERIOLE.

## Source[^3]
- A blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart towards the other body tissues. Most arteries carry oxygenated blood (the pulmonary artery is an exception). The large arteries branch to form smaller ones, which in turn branch into arterioles. Collagen and elastin fibers in the walls of arteries enable them to withstand the high pressures of circulating blood. They also create elastic recoil of the artery wall during the nonpumping phase (diastole) of the cardiac cycle, which maintains and 'smooths' the directional flow of blood around the body. Contraction and relaxation of the smooth muscle layer in the wall regulates blood pressure under the influence of the autonomic nervous system and hormones. The accumulation of fatty deposits in the walls of the arteries leads to atherosclerosis, which limits and may eventually block the flow of blood. Compare VEIN.
