- A solid mixture in which small molecules of one compound or element are trapped in holes in the crystal lattice of another substance. Clathrates are sometimes called enclosure compounds or cage compounds, but they are not true compounds (the molecules are not held by chemical bonds). Quinol and ice both form clathrates with such substances as sulphur dioxide and xenon.
