- speed of a computer. A rather vaguely defined term that is often used to indicate the relative processing power of a given computer system, since the power of a computer is largely governed by the ability of the central processing unit to execute instructions rapidly. The CPUâ€™s speed is itself dependent on numerous factors such as word length, instruction set, technology of implementation, and memory access times.
