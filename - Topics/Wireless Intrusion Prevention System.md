- A wireless intrusion prevention system (WIPS) is network security hardware or software designed to continuously monitor devices and prevent them from connecting to a wireless LAN network whenever malicious activity is suspected. The WIPS scans the network and reports, blocks, or drops various forms of wireless threats including misconfigured devices, rogue access points (AP), and denial of service attacks so that all local networks and information assets are protected.
