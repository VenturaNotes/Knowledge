- The setting of product selling prices based on the charging of marginal costs only to the product. The approach is only likely to be used in exceptional circumstances, such as when competition is intensive, as its application to the complete range of products is likely to cause the business to make losses by its failure to cover its fixed costs. Compare COST-PLUS PRICING; FULL COST PRICING.
