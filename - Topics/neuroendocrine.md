## Source [^1]
- adj. Of or relating to certain functions that are under dual control of the nervous system and the endocrine glands. The term has become popular as it has become increasingly apparent that the endocrine system cannot be considered separately from the nervous system, because the same chemical compound (for example, noradrenalin) can function both as a neurotransmitter and as a hormone. \[From Greek neuron a nerve + endon within + krinein to separate]
