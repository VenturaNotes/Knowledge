- $n$. a cosmetic condition that affects the teeth as a result of high fluoride intake during the first eight years of life, i.e. during enamel formation. Dental fluorosis is characterized by mottled enamel, which is opaque and may be stained. Its incidence increases when the level of fluoride in the water supply is above 2 parts per million. The mottled enamel is resistant to dental caries. When the level is over 8 parts per million, systemic fluorosis may occur, with calcification of ligaments.
