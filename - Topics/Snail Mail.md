- Snail mail is a term used to describe paper-based mail that is sent by postal services such as the U.S. Postal Service, FedEx, and United Parcel Service. Mail sent via postal services often takes time to receive when compared to sending mail via email, hence the reference to slow-moving snails. To ensure time-sensitive business communications reach their destination quickly, companies often use email rather than postal services to send messages to their customers, workforces, and business partners. However, snail mail is sometimes used to send less time-sensitive communications to business stakeholders such as postcards during the holidays.
