- A former monetary system in which a country's currency unit was fixed in terms of gold. In this system a currency was freely convertible into gold and free import and export of gold was permitted. It formed the basis for stable prices, since it linked the money supply to the quantity of gold reserves in a country. The UK was on the gold standard from the early 19th century until it finally withdrew in 1931. Most other countries withdrew soon after. See also International Monetary Fund.

- A system for fixing exchange rates by the central bank or government of each country making its currency freely convertible into gold at a fixed price. Under this system the par value of exchange rates is set by the amount of each currency that can be obtained for a given quantity of gold. Exchange rates thus cannot shift further from parity than the limits set by the transaction costs of shipping gold between different countries, which is usually a very small percentage of its value. The same applies if gold actually circulates within each country, provided it can be imported and exported freely.
