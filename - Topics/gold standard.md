- A former monetary system in which a country's currency unit was fixed in terms of gold. In this system a currency was freely convertible into gold and free import and export of gold was permitted. It formed the basis for stable prices, since it linked the money supply to the quantity of gold reserves in a country. The UK was on the gold standard from the early 19th century until it finally withdrew in 1931. Most other countries withdrew soon after. See also International Monetary Fund.
