- (Latin: with equal step) Ranking equally. When a new issue of shares is said to rank pari passu with existing shares, the new shares carry the same dividend rights and winding-up rights as the existing shares. A pari passu loan is one in which the borrower agrees that this new loan will rank equally with other existing debts.
