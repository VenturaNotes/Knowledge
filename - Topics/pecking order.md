- $n$. A dominance hierarchy within a flock of poultry in which each bird is able to peck without retaliation only those lower in the hierarchy and is liable to be pecked only by those above. There are usually separate pecking orders for males and females, with all the males dominating all the females, and the highest-ranked (alpha or $\alpha$ ) male, often with the largest comb (itself determined by high testosterone level), dominating all the others but in practice pecking only his nearest rivals. Also called a peck order. Compare hook ORder. \[A literal translation of the German Hackordnung, the name given to it in 1922 by the Norwegian zoologist Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe (1894-1976) following his pioneering study of domestic hens]
