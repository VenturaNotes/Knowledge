- (product group) of two groups $G$ and $H$ with group operations $\rho$ and $\tau$ respectively. The group consisting of the elements in the Cartesian product of $G$ and $H$ and on which there is a dyadic operation $\circ$ defined as follows:

  

$$

\left(g_{1}, h_{1}\right) \circ\left(g_{2}, h_{2}\right)=\left(g_{1} \rho g_{2}, h_{1} \tau h_{2}\right)

$$

  

The identity of this group is then just $\left(e_{\mathrm{G}}, e_{\mathrm{H}}\right)$, where $e_{\mathrm{G}}$ and $e_{\mathrm{H}}$ are the identities of groups $G$ and $H$ respectively. The inverse of $(g, h)$ is then $\left(g^{-1}, h^{-1}\right)$.

  

These concepts can be generalized to deal with the direct product of any finite number of groups on which there are specified group operations.
