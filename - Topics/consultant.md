- An outside specialist hired by an enterprise to advise on particular technical, commercial, or legal aspects of its activities. A person or firm employed as a consultant normally has a reputation for technical expertise and experience. Consultants have no executive authority within the organizations which hire them: their function is to give advice to the management, which will not necessarily act on it. Consultants are often employed in the course of resolving internal disputes in an organization about its best course of action.
