- An outside specialist hired by an enterprise to advise on particular technical, commercial, or legal aspects of its activities. A person or firm employed as a consultant normally has a reputation for technical expertise and experience. Consultants have no executive authority within the organizations which hire them: their function is to give advice to the management, which will not necessarily act on it. Consultants are often employed in the course of resolving internal disputes in an organization about its best course of action.

- $n$. a fully trained specialist in a branch of medicine. In Britain, consultants are responsible for the care of patients within a distinct specialty, usually in hospital wards, but they are allowed to opt for some sessions in private practice in addition to any National Health Service commitments. After completion of the Foundation Programme and (from 2019) the Internal Medicine Training programme doctors continuing in hospital service undertake further training as specialty registrars in their chosen specialty. When a specialty registrar has successfully completed a defined college or faculty specialist training programme, he or she is awarded a Certificate of Completion of Training (CCT) and is eligible to apply for a consultant post. See also Doctor.
