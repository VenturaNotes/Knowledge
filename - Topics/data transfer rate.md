- The rate at which data can be moved between devices. The average rate is usually determined by the capability of the read or write device but the instantaneous rate is determined by the capability of the interface or transmission path. Buffer memories are used to achieve the change in rate. Disk storage systems can have [[transfer rate|transfer rates]] of the order of 1 gigabyte per second. Fast serial interfaces operate in the 800 Gbps range.
