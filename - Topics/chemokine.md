- $n$. any one of a group of small proteins that guide leucocytes to sites of infection and are vital for immune function. They fall into two main classes, CC chemokines and CXC chemokines; receptors (denoted R) are named after the class that bind to them, and subtypes of each class are indicated by numbers (e.g. CCR5).
## Source[^2]
- Any of a large family of small proteins, produced by many types of cells, that attract and guide white blood cells (leucocytes) to sites of infection or influence lymphocyte development and migration in lymph nodes. Hence they are a crucial aspect of innate immunity during the initial response to injury or pathogen invasion and affect lymphocyte behavior in adaptive immune responses. They fall into four main structural categories: $C$, $\mathrm{CC}, \mathrm{CXC}$, and $\mathrm{CX}_{3} \mathrm{C}$, according to the number of cysteine residues (C) or variable amino acids (X) near the amino terminus of the protein. For example, CXCL8 (formerly interleukin 8) is produced by monocytes, macrophages, and other cells and causes neutrophils to migrate from nearby blood vessels to the site of inflammation. CCL2 similarly attracts monocytes from the bloodstream and induces them to change into tissue macrophages. Chemokines act in conjunction with other factors, such as tumor necrosis factor $\alpha$(TNF- $\alpha$), which induces the adhesion factors necessary to bring the leucocytes alongside the blood vessel wall before they 'squeeze through' into the tissues.
