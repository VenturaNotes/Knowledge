- A clocked flip-flop whose output 'toggles', i.e. changes to the complementary logic state, on every active transition of the clock signal (see CLOCK). The device acts as a divide-by-two counter since two active transitions of the clock signal generate one active transition of the output. It can be considered as being equivalent to a JK flip-flop whose J and K inputs are held at logic 1.
