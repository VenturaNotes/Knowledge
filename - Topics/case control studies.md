- A study in which 'cases' that have a particular condition are compared with 'controls' that do not, to see how they differ on an explanatory variable of interest. In the same way that matched pairs are useful in designing an experiment, matching patients by other possible explanatory variables can improve the effectiveness of the study. There are still inherent problems due to the possibility of confounding variables.
