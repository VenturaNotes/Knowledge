- Opportunity cost represents the potential benefits that a business, an investor, or an individual consumer misses out on when choosing one alternative over another. 
- We can express opportunity cost in terms of a [[return]] (or [[profit]]) on investment by using the following mathematical formula
	- Opportunity Cost = RMPIC - RCIP
		- [[RMPIC]] = Return on most profitable investment choice
		- [[RICP]] = Return on investment chosen to pursue

- Problem #1 teaches [[budget constraints]] and [[opportunity cost]]
### Problem 1
- A student has a monthly budget of $150 to spend on either beers, which cost $5 each, or tacos, which cost $3 each.
	- Largest number of beers is $\frac{150}{5} = 30$ 
	- Largest number of tacos is $\frac {150}{3} = 50$
	- Student's budget constraint where beers on x-axis and tacos on y-axis
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-10-27 at 1.15.22 AM.png|400]]
			- The budget constraint line is a line between the number of beers the student could afford if she spent her entire budget on beers and the number of tacos the student could afford if she spent her entire budget on tacos.
			- The budget constraint line represents the maximum number of beers and tacos the student can buy
				- Right of line represents combinations of beers and tacos that are unaffordable
				- Left of line represents combinations of beers and tacos that would leave some budget unspent
- The equation for any budget constraint: $P_1*Q_1+P_2*Q_2+...+P_n*Q_n$
	- Equation for student's budget constraint is
		- $150 = Q_1*5 + Q_2 * 3$
	- Opportunity cost of a beer: $\frac 53$
		- The opportunity cost of a beer is the number of tacos that the student could buy instead of buying a single beer
	- Opportunity cost of a taco: $\frac {3}{5}$
		- The opportunity cost of a taco is the number of beers that the student could buy instead of buying a single taco

- Opportunity cost is the cost of something in terms of what is given up to get it. It is a key concept in understanding [[budget constraints]], which are the limits on what a person can afford to buy
	- [[budget constraints|budget constraint]]
		- The boundary of the set of all possible combinations of goods and services that a person can afford given their income and the prices of goods
	- [[Opportunity cost]]
		- The cost of something in terms of what is given up to get it
	- Slope of the budget constraint
		- Shows the opportunity cost of acquiring an additional item on the x-axis. The slope is also called the [[marginal rate of substitution]] (ERS)
- Examples of opportunity cost and budget constraints
	- Burgers and bust tickets: With a limited budget, you can only buy a limited number of burgers and bus tickets. The more burgers you buy, the fewer bus tickets you can buy

## Source[^4]
- The cost of the next most valuable opportunity is known as an opportunity cost

## Source[^5]
- The value of the next best alternative foregone
	- Example: If you choose to study for 4 hours instead of working, the wages you forgo are your opportunity cost. 
## Source[^6]
- The economic cost of an action measured in terms of the benefit foregone by not pursuing the best alternative course of action. The cost of funds, for example, must be measured in terms of the returns they could earn in the capital markets for taking the same degree of risk. Opportunity cost is an important factor in decision making (see COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS), although it represents costs that are not recorded in the accounts of the relevant organization.
