- $n$. A theory of drug addiction that avoids the assumption that addicts are motivated to take drugs either to experience pleasure or euphoria or to avoid unpleasant withdrawal symptoms. The theory proposes that potentially addictive drugs produce long-lasting changes in brain organization in areas normally involved in the process of incentive motivation and reward and elsewhere, especially the nucleus accumbens. These changes cause brain reward systems to become hypersensitive to drugs and drug-associated stimuli, causing the drug user to 'want' the drug more and more, with the consequence that 'wanting' becomes dissociated from 'liking', and addicts continue to take drugs even when they derive no pleasure or relief from withdrawal symptoms from doing so. The theory was first proposed by the Canadian psychologist Terry E. Robinson (born 1949) and Kent C(harles) Berridge (born 1957) in an article in the journal Brain Research Reviews in 1993.
