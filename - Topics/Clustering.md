- Let's say we have demographic information for a number of current or potential customers. To understand which types of customers are similar to each other, we group individuals according to their observed characteristics.

- The tendency of firms in certain industries to concentrate in geographic areas where there are other firms of a similar type. This enables them to use the services of related industries providing inputs of goods and services, and possibly to gain from the training provided by other firms in a cluster by poaching their skilled labour force. This is held to explain the tendency of industries to concentrate in particular areas, for example Silicon Valley in California, with a high density of electronics and computer-based industries, and the M4 corridor in England. Economic development agencies often aim at the creation of new clusters; this is sometimes difficult to achieve, as it involves simultaneous investment in various industries and forms of technical education.

- (1) In computer graphics, the collecting of nearby objects into groups so that their effect in a radiosity calculation with another well-separated group can be approximated by a single interaction. 
- (2) An approach used in machine learning and data mining that attempts to place data into groups. The intention is that groupings or clusters will emerge that have meaning for the application problem (see CONCEPT LEARNING). Clusters may be formed on the basis of some similarity features but their characteristics do not have to be predefined (in contrast to classifier systems).
