- (oviduct, uterine tube) either of a pair of tubes that conduct ova (egg cells) from the ovary to the uterus (see REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM). The ovarian end opens into the abdominal cavity via a funnel-shaped structure with finger-like projections (fimbriae) surrounding the opening. Movements of the fimbriae at ovulation assist in directing the ovum to the Fallopian tube. The ovum is fertilized near the ovarian end of the tube. \[G. Fallopius (1523-63), Italian anatomist]
