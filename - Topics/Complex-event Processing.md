- Complex-event processing (CEP) is a form of computing that relies on event data to trigger the creation of more wide-scale events. This is done by identifying and analyzing a large number of small events to develop a better understanding of the events as a whole. Through this process, businesses can understand which events occurred as well as why each event happened, which allows them to be more informed in all aspects of their business.
