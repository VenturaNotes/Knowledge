- $n$. the process of production of granulocytes, which normally occurs in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow. Granulocytes are ultimately derived from a haemopoietic stem cell, but the earliest precursor that can be identified microscopically is the myeloblast. This divides and passes through a series of stages of maturation termed respectively promyelocyte, myelocyte, and metamyelocyte, before becoming a mature granulocyte. See also HAEMOPOIESIS.
