- (1) A depression or cavity in the secondary wall of a plant cell that facilitates the movement of substances between adjacent cells. The equivalent structures in primary cell walls are called primary pit fields, areas where plasmodesmata are concentrated and pit development usually occurs. A pit comprises a pit membrane, consisting of the middle lamella plus the primary wall; and a pit cavity, the depression in the secondary wall. Pits usually occur in pairs (called pit pairs) on either side of the middle lamella between two adjacent cells.
