- Augmented reality (AR) is the integration of digital information with the user's environment in real time.

## Source[^2]
- Augmented reality, or AR, is the projection of computer-generated visual and audio elements onto the physical world. It differs from virtual reality because it takes place within real-life scenarios. Virtual reality, on the other hand, is a computer-created space in which a user can interact as if itâ€™s real. AR includes real-world objects and is used to create a tangible experience for the user. Apps, headsets, and special glasses are typically used to experience AR.
