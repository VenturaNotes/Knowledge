- (1) A bond traded in a number of different markets. 
- (2) A single bond for the total amount of a new issue of bonds, issued on a temporary basis to the bank (normally the paying agent) that has responsibility for distributing the actual bonds to investors. In due course the global bond, sometimes referred to as a global bearer bond, is exchanged for the actual bonds.
