- A method of capital budgeting in which managers calculate the time required before the forecast discounted cash inflows from an investment will equal the initial investment expenditure (see DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW). This method is similar to the payback period method but makes some allowance for the time value of money. Despite theoretical problems, it is widely used in practice.
