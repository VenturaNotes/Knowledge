## Source [^1]
- the religious or moral belief that all life $\textendash$ and especially all human life $\textendash$ is intrinsically valuable and so should never be deliberately harmed or destroyed. Many of those who hold such a view will have ethical objections to euthanasia, abortion, and embryo research. The phrase may also be used to denote that the value of life should always be respected, whatever the perceived quality of that life. See also humanitY; PERSONHOOD.
