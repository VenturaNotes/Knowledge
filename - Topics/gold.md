- A precious metal, widely used both as a form of money and for jewellery and other ornamental purposes. Gold was already used in these other ways before its use as money and the invention of coinage. Gold coinage was at one time in general circulation, but the monetary use of gold is now confined to holdings of gold bullion by central banks as part of their foreign exchange reserves. Gold is still widely used as a store of value by individuals who mistrust government-created money because it is vulnerable to inflation. Gold costs real resources to mine, so that its value is not liable to be destroyed by inflation, unlike fiat money. See also GOLD STANDARD.

- n. 
- (1) a bright yellow metal that is very malleable. In dentistry pure gold is now very rarely used as a filling. Gold alloys are used for crowns, inlays, and bridges, either alone or veneered with a tooth-coloured material, but increasingly nonprecious alloys are being used. Gold alloys are now only rarely used as the metal framework for partial dentures, cobalt-chromium alloys being used instead. 
- (2) (in pharmacology) a compound of the metal gold, sodium aurothiomalate, used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis. Side-effects may include blood disorders, severe skin rash and allergy, inflammation of the colon, and kidney damage. Because of this, its use has largely been replaced by methotrexate and biological therapies.
