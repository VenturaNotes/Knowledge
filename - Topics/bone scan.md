- an imaging investigation of a patient's bone using radioactive tracers. Technetium-99m phosphate is injected intravenously and absorbed into the hydroxyapatite crystals of bone. It concentrates in areas of increased blood flow and metabolism, such as areas of infection, trauma, and neoplasia, and gives off radiation that can be detected by a gamma camera, thereby producing a map or scan of activity in the target area. A bone scan is particularly useful in the diagnosis of subtle fractures (including stress fractures), avascular necrosis (see OSTEONECROSIS), osteomyelitis, tumour spread (metastasis), and loosening of orthopaedic implants.
