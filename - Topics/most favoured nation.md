- (MFN) A country with rights for equal treatment under a trade agreement. An MFN clause stipulates that imports from the partner country will be treated no less favourably than imports of similar goods from any other country. In the case of tariffs, this means no other foreign goods face a lower tariff than those from the partner country. With quota restrictions on trade the meaning of MFN is unclear.
