- (African trypanosomiasis) a disease of tropical Africa caused by the presence in the blood of the parasitic protozoans Trypanosoma gambiense or T. rhodesiense. The parasites are transmitted through the bite of tsetse flies. Initial symptoms include fever, headache, and chills, followed later by enlargement of the lymph nodes, anaemia, and pains in the limbs and joints. After a period of several months or even years, the parasites invade the minute blood vessels supplying the central nervous system. This causes drowsiness and lethargy, and ultimately - if untreated the patient dies. Rhodesian sleeping sickness is the more virulent form of the disease. Drugs used to treat the acute stage of the disease include eflornithine, pentamidine, and suramin; melarsoprol (a drug containing arsenic) is used after the brain is affected. Eradication of tsetse flies helps prevent spread of the infection.
