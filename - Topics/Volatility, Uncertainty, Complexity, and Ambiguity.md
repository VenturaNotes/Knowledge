- VUCA stands for volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity: the four different challenges that make a corporate situation hard to navigate. Volatility refers to a situation that is quite unstable and unexpected. Uncertainty refers to a lack of understanding regarding the cause and effect of a certain event that has occurred. Complexity refers to a situation that involves multiple, interrelated issues that are difficult to understand. Ambiguity refers to a lack of clarity regarding the facts of a situation. The VUCA method states that each of these four challenges can be worked through by asking probing questions to help assess risks and develop mitigation strategies.
