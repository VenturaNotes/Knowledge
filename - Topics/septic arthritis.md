- (pyogenic arthritis) infection in a joint. The joint is swollen, hot, and tender, and movement causes severe pain. The infecting organism (usually Staphylococcus aureus) can enter the joint via the bloodstream, from an injection or penetrating injury, or by direct spread from an adjacent area of osteomyelitis. The condition is a surgical emergency as it can lead to rapid destruction of articular cartilage, loss of joint function, and septicaemia. Treatment is by arthrotomy or irrigation of the joint by arthroscopy, with appropriate antibiotic therapy.
