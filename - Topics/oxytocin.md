- It is a peptide hormone and a [[neuropeptide]]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a hormone, released by the pituitary gland, that causes contraction of the uterus during labour and stimulates milk flow from the breasts by causing contraction of muscle fibres in the milk ducts. Intravenous infusions or injections of oxytocin are used to induce labour and to control or prevent postpartum haemorrhage. Combined with ergometrine, oxytocin is used to control bleeding after incomplete miscarriage or abortion, or for active management of the third stage of labor.
## Source[^3]
- A hormone, produced by birds and mammals, that in mammals causes both contraction of smooth muscle in the uterus during birth and expulsion of milk from the mammary glands during suckling. Like antidiuretic hormone, oxytocin is produced in the neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus (see NEUROSECRETION) but is stored and secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. In some species the high circulating levels of oxytocin immediately after birth are associated with a critical period for the mother's bonding with her newborn young. See also NEUROPHYSIN.
