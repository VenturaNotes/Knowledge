- It is a peptide hormone and a [[neuropeptide]]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a hormone, released by the pituitary gland, that causes contraction of the uterus during labor and stimulates milk flow from the breasts by causing contraction of muscle fibers in the milk ducts. Intravenous infusions or injections of oxytocin are used to induce labor and to control or prevent postpartum haemorrhage. Combined with ergometrine, oxytocin is used to control bleeding after incomplete miscarriage or abortion, or for active management of the third stage of labor.
## Source[^3]
- A hormone, produced by birds and mammals, that in mammals causes both contraction of smooth muscle in the uterus during birth and expulsion of milk from the mammary glands during suckling. Like antidiuretic hormone, oxytocin is produced in the neurosecretory cells of the hypothalamus (see NEUROSECRETION) but is stored and secreted by the posterior pituitary gland. In some species the high circulating levels of oxytocin immediately after birth are associated with a critical period for the mother's bonding with her newborn young. See also NEUROPHYSIN.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. A hormone and neurotransmitter alphahypophame (formula: $\left.\mathrm{C}_{43} \mathrm{H}_{66} \mathrm{~N}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{12} \mathrm{~S}_{2}\right)$, with a chemical structure similar to vasopressin, secreted by the posterior pituitary and also manufactured synthetically. In females it is secreted during and after childbirth and in response to sucking of the breast, stimulating lactation and contractions of the muscles of the uterus, and in males it is implicated in the ejaculatory response during sexual activity. It tends to increase social and maternal bonding, in-group trust and empathy, and rejection of outsiders. It was discovered in 1906 by the English pharmacologist Sir Henry Hallett Dale (1875-1968). OT abbrev. \[From Greek oxys sharp + tokos birth, alluding to the fact that it induces uterine contractions]
