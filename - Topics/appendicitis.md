- $n$. inflammation of the vermiform appendix. The typical presentation of acute appendicitis is central abdominal pain, which later migrates to the right lower abdomen; other symptoms include malaise, anorexia, nausea and vomiting, and even diarrhoea. Palpation of the abdomen may reveal tenderness overlying the inflamed appendix (see McBurney's POINT). Unusual positions of the appendix may cause pain in different sites, leading to difficulty in diagnosis. Acute appendicitis is a surgical emergency requiring removal of the appendix (appendicectomy). Failure to do so may lead to abscess formation, perforation, peritonitis, lifethreatening sepsis, and circulatory shock. Conditions that mimic appendicitis include mesenteric lymphadenitis, terminal ileitis (see Crohn's DISEASE), right-sided ectopic pregnancy, a right-sided kidney stone, pyelonephritis, and (rarely) right-sided pneumonia.
