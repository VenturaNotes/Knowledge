- A schedule identifying the media to be used for an advertising programme and the dates on which advertisements are to appear. Decisions have to be made on:
	- reach (the percentage of market that would be expected to see the ad);
	- frequency (how often the target market would see the ad);
	- impact (qualitative value of the ad);
	- major media to be used (TV, Internet, newspapers and magazines, etc.);
	- media vehicles (specific media to be used, e.g. The Times newspaper);
	- media timing (the schedule of the appearance of the ads in the chosen media).
