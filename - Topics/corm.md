- An underground organ formed by certain plants, e.g. crocus and gladiolus, that enables them to survive from one growing season to the next (see illustration). It consists of a short swollen food-storing stem surrounded by protective scale leaves. One or more buds in the axils of scale leaves produce new foliage leaves and flowers in the subsequent season, using up the food stored in the stem. Compare Bulb.
