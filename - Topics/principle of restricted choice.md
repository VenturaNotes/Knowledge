- $n$. A rule influencing the play of certain card combinations in the game of bridge, first discussed by the British-born US bridge expert Alan F(raser) Truscott (1925-2005) and later developed and named by the English player and author (John) Terence Reese (1913-96) in his book The Expert Game (1958), based on the same probabilistic phenomenon as the Monty Hall problem, according to which if a certain action could have been taken either because there was no alternative or as a result of a choice between two alternatives, then the first possibility is twice as likely as the second, other things being equal.
