- (PMS) a group of symptoms experienced in varying degrees by women of reproductive age up to two weeks before menstruation. These include altered mental stability, fatigue, bloating, breast tenderness, and headaches. Premenstrual symptoms that are more severe and have a substantial impact on many aspects of a woman's life are classified in DSM-5 as premenstrual dysphoric disorder and may include more psychological symptoms (e.g. depression, extreme anxiety, and tension). Treatment for mild cases includes support, reassurance, dietary guidance, and stress reduction. More severe cases may require hormone therapy (gonadorelin analogues, combined oral contraceptives, progestogens), diuretics, and SSRIs.
