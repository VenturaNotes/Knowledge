## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. A sound wave or any other time series that resembles white noise, being essentially random, but with intensity or energy in inverse proportion to frequency, and hence more energy in the bass than the treble because high-frequency sound is more energetic than low-frequency sound. The sound of a waterfall, or waves crashing on a beach, is pink noise. See also noise (2). Compare colored noise, frozen noise. \[So called by analogy with white light in which higher frequencies (shorter waves) are damped, leading to a pink tinge]
