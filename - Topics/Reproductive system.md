## Source[^2]
- The organs that are involved in the process of sexual reproduction in an organism. The reproductive system of a flowering plant is found in the flower and consists of the stamens (male organs) and carpels (female organs). In mammals the reproductive system consists of the testes, epididymis, sperm duct, and penis in the male and the ovaries, fallopian tubes, and uterus in the female (see illustration).
