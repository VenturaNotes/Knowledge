- $n$. A visual illusion of filling-in consisting of a central black dot surrounded by a dark region that fades very gradually into a lighter background. Steady, unmoving fixation on the dot with one eye (keeping the other eye closed or covered) causes the dark region to vanish after a few seconds by a process of filling-in, but the effect is eliminated if the dark region is surrounded by a clearly defined ring or boundary (see illustration). The illusion arises from an approximation to a stabilized retinal image: the eye movements resulting from physiological nystagmus during fixation do not produce any noticeable changes in the peripheral areas of the retinal image because of its smoothly graded contour, and the visual system therefore allows the image to fade as if it were fixed, but the addition of a sharply defined ring or boundary makes movements in the peripheral image detectable and causes the visual system to refresh that part of the image.

	- Filling-in illusion. In the left-hand figure, steady fixation on the black dot with one eye, keeping the other eye covered or closed, causes the dark region surrounding the dot to disappear, whereas in the right-hand figure the ring prevents fading.
