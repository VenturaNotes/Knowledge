- (small ubiquitin-related modifier) Any of a family of proteins with structural similarity to ubiquitin that are attached to other proteins within cells and modify their function or change their cellular location. Attachment of SUMO$\textemdash$SUMOylation$\textemdash$occurs chiefly in the nucleus as a post-translational modification and generally prolongs a protein's life. It can, for example, determine how a protein controls transcription or whether it moves from the nucleus to the cytosol.
