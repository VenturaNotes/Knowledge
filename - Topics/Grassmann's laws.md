- (perception) $n$. Three basic laws of color mixing. If $x$, $y$, and z are distinct stimulus colors, and if the symbol $=$ indicates visual matching, then the laws state that: (a) If $x=y$, then $x+\mathrm{z}=y+\mathrm{z}$ (if equivalent colors are added to equivalent colors, then the sums are also equivalent); (b) If $x=y$, then $x-z=y-z$ (if equivalent colors are subtracted from equivalent colors, then the differences are also equivalent); (c) If $x=\mathrm{z}$ and $y=\mathrm{z}$, then $x=y$ (colors that are equivalent to the same color are equivalent to each other). See also additive primary, primary color (1, 2), Subtractive primary. \[Named after the German-Polish mathematician and physicist Hermann G(Ã¼nther) Grassmann (1809-77) who formulated them in 1853]
