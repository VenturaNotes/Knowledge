- An agreement between an advertising agency and a client on the objectives of an advertising campaign. It is important that the client knows exactly what the objectives are, helps to plan the overall strategy, and sets the budgets. Once the brief has been agreed the agency can prepare and evaluate the advertisements themselves and develop the media plan.
