- Demand generation is a specific type of marketing tactic. A business will try to stimulate demand generation. They do this by improving a customer's awareness of the business's services and products. In doing so, the business makes the customer more aware of what the business has to offer. This, in turn, builds a long-term relationship with a customer. Demand generation may not involve immediate sales or more traditional forms of marketing, such as broad "BUY NOW" messages. Instead, it involves a long process that incorporates a traditional sales funnel approach.
