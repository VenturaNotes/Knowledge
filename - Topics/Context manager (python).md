### Protocol
- For an object to be used with the [[with (python)|with]] statement, it must implement two special methods: [[__enter__() (python)|__enter__()]] and [[__exit__() (python)|__exit__()]]
	- #question What is the enter and exit methods here?
	- #question what do underscores mean when naming these kinds of functions
- `__enter__()` method
	- executed at the beginning of the `with` block. It can perform setup actions and must return the object that will be assigned to the variable after the `as` keyword, if present.
		- #question What is the [[as (python)|as]] keyword?
		- #question what does the with block look like?
		- #question "returns object assigned to variable after `as` keyword?" what does this mean? 
- `__exit__()` method
	- Executed at end of `with` block even if [[exception (Python)|exception]] occurs.
	- It can handle cleanup actions and can optionally suppress exceptions by returning True.

### Syntax
```python
with expression as variable:
	#code block (suite)
```
- #question Does code block mean "suite?"
- `expression` evaluates to a context manager object
	- #question What is a context manager object?
- `variable` os optional and bound to result of `__ente__()`
	- #question how is variable optional

### File Handling Example
```python
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)
# No need to explicitly close the file, it is handled by the with statement
```
- `open('example.txt', 'r')` returns a file object which acts as a context manager. 
- The `__enter__()` method opens the file, and the `__exit__()` method closes the file, ensuring proper resource management.
	- #question I don't see these methods within opening the file though. What does this mean. Is it also optional then? 

### Custom Context Manager
- Can create a custom context manager by defining a class with `__enter__()` and `__exit__()` methods or by using the [[contextlib (python)]] module
	- #question what is the contextlib module?
```python
class MyContextManager:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering the context")
        return self  # Optionally return something

    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting the context")
        # Handle exceptions if needed
        return False  # Returning False propagates exceptions, True suppresses them

with MyContextManager() as cm:
    print("Inside the context")
```
#question Analyze these lines of code later. It doesn't make much sense to me...
Output
```
Entering the context
Inside the context
Exiting the context
```
### Contextlib
- The `contextlib` module provides utilities for creating context managers. 
- A useful decorator is `contextmanager`
	- #question What is meant by `decorator`?
	- Allows for writing context managers using generator functions
		- #question difference between generator functions and generator expressions? 
```python
from contextlib import contextmanager

@contextmanager
def my_context_manager():
    print("Entering the context")
    try:
        yield
    finally:
        print("Exiting the context")

with my_context_manager():
    print("Inside the context")

```
#question what does the @ mean in python? is it something that is necessary or provides overriding? 
#question What does [[yield (python)|yield]] do again in terms of python generators? 
#question Give me details about the [[finally (Python)|finally]] method
#question What does it mean when using `with` alongside a function
#question Simply help me understand this code

Output
```
Entering the context
Inside the context
Exiting the context
```
