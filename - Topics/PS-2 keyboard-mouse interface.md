- PS/2 was a type of personal computer (now obsolete) produced by IBM in the 1980s. The interface, a mini DIN connector, survives as the commonest connector for keyboards and mice. The pin connections are identical for both devices and frequently the interface may be used for either device. This feature is commonly found in laptop computers where a full-sized keyboard or mouse may be used in place of the native one.
