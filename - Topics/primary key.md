- A key that uniquely identifies each row of a table in a relational database. It may be composed of one or more columns and must not have the value null. Tables do not need to have primary keys, and indeed they are no more significant than other keys in the relational database model. Rather, they are an indication to the database management system of a good way to identify each row. Some DBMSs insist they be present for some operations.
