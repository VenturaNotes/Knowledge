- Any undertaking, whether by a single organization or a consortium of scientific institutions, to map and sequence the entire genome of an organism. The bacterium Haemophilus influenzae was the first organism to be sequenced; the first eukaryotic genome to be sequenced was that of the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. A massive international collaboration resulted in the sequencing of the human genome, completed in 2003 (see human GENOME PROJECT). By 2018 the Genomes OnLine Database (GOLD), held details of nearly 200,000 sequencing projects, either completed or ongoing, involving species drawn from all groups of organisms.
