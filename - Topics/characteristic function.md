- of a subset $S$ of a universal set $U$. A function that indicates whether or not an element is a member of the subset $S$. It is the function$$f: U \rightarrow\{0,1\}$$defined as follows:$$\begin{array}{ll}f(x)=1 & \text { if } x \in S \\f(x)=0 & \text { if } x \notin S\end{array}$$The codomain might also be given as {true, false} or $\{1,2\}$.
