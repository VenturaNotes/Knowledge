- of a subset $S$ of a universal set $U$. A function that indicates whether or not an element is a member of the subset $S$. It is the function$$f: U \rightarrow\{0,1\}$$defined as follows:$$\begin{array}{ll}f(x)=1 & \text { if } x \in S \\f(x)=0 & \text { if } x \notin S\end{array}$$The codomain might also be given as {true, false} or $\{1,2\}$.

- (probability Given a random variable $X$, then its characteristic function is $\varphi_X(t)=\mathrm{E}\left(\mathrm{e}^{i t X}\right)$, where E denotes the expectation. If the probability density function is $f_{X}:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$, then note that $\varphi_{X}(t)=\hat{f}_{X}(-t)$, where $\hat{f}_{X}$ denotes the Fourier transform. Characteristic functions have the merit of converging, which is not always the case for moment generating functions (see CAUCHY DISTRIBUTION).
