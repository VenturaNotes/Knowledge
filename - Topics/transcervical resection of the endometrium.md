- (TCRE) an operation, which is performed under local anaesthetic, in which the membrane lining the uterus (see ENDOMETRIUM) is cut away by a form of electrosurgery using a resectoscope, which is introduced through the cervix. Like endometrial ablation, TCRE is used as an alternative to hysterectomy to treat abnormally heavy menstrual bleeding as it results in fewer complications and shorter stays in hospital.
