- A tool for numerical data analysis that summarizes the relationship among the variables in a data set as an equation, where the variable of interest, or the dependent variable, is expressed as a function of one or several explanatory variables. The name regression originates from the phenomenon of regression to the average in heights of children compared to the heights of their parents, described by Francis Galton (1822-1911) in the 1870s. See also LINEAR REGRESSION; MULTIPLE REGRESSION; NONLINEAR REGRESSION.
