## Synthesis
- In supervised learning, regression predicts continuous numerical values
	- This means the output can be a value within a range. For example:
		- Predicting the price of a house (could be $300,000, $300,00.50, etc)
		- Predicting the temperature tomorrow
	- #question What kinds of regression are there?
	- #question What is supervised learning?

- A tool for numerical data analysis that summarizes the relationship among the variables in a data set as an equation, where the variable of interest, or the dependent variable, is expressed as a function of one or several explanatory variables. The name regression originates from the phenomenon of regression to the average in heights of children compared to the heights of their parents, described by Francis Galton (1822-1911) in the 1870s. See also LINEAR REGRESSION; MULTIPLE REGRESSION; NONLINEAR REGRESSION.

- $n$. (in psychiatry) reversion to a more immature level of functioning. The term may be applied to the state of a patient in hospital who becomes incontinent and demanding. It may also be applied to a single psychological function; for example, psychoanalysts speak of the libido regressing to an early stage of development.
