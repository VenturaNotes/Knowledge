- The term digital wellbeing describes the ability of a person to effectively manage the negative impacts of technology on their professional and personal lives. The aim of digital wellbeing is to promote the healthy use of technological devices. Today, digital wellbeing is more important than ever, considering most organizations require their employees to use various technologies to streamline their daily workflows. Employees that check their social media accounts multiple times during the workday, spend excessive amounts of time staring at a computer screen without taking breaks, and address every notification that pops up on their mobile devices tend to have a poor sense of digital wellbeing. Companies can prioritize their employees' digital-wellbeings by reducing the amount of online team meetings, encouraging their employees to limit non-critical communications in the workplace, and encouraging their employees to switch their monitor display settings to dark mode to limit eye strain.
