- (polyspermia) $n$. fertilization of a single ovum by more than one spermatozoon: the development is abnormal and the embryo dies.

- The entry of several sperms into the egg during fertilization although only one sperm nucleus actually fuses with the egg nucleus. Physiological polyspermy occurs naturally in a wide range of animals, including arachnids, insects, cartilaginous fishes, urodele amphibians, reptiles, and birds$\textemdash$characteristically animals having yolky eggs. In other species polyspermy is pathological$\textemdash$it results in abnormal fertilization and death of the embryo. Hence the entry of a sperm into the egg triggers changes in the surface layer of the egg that prevent the entry of any additional sperms.
