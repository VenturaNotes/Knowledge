- $n$. In psychometrics, two or more similar versions of a psychometric test. If they are similar in content but have not been shown to have similar psychometric properties, then they are also called comparable forms; if they have similar means, standard deviations, and correlations with other tests, then they are also called parallel forms; and if they are similar in all important psychometric properties, then they are also called equivalent forms. Also, especially in the US, called alternate forms.
