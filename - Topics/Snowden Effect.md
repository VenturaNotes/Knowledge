- In 2013, a former National Security Agency (NSA) contractor named Edward Snowden leaked documents from the NSA, revealing that the agency was collecting information from the electronic devices of U.S. citizens without their knowledge. This data breach was accomplished with the help of major American tech companies including Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, AOL, PalTalk, and Yahoo. The result of this leak was coined the Snowden Effect: an increase in public concern regarding the information security and information privacy rights of U.S. citizens. The Snowden Effect has had a massive impact on the tech industry today, causing tech companies to find ways to better address customer data privacy concerns, such as implementing the use of data security products like data encryption services.
