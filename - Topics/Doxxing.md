- Doxxing is the act of broadcasting someoneʻs personal information—such as their name, address, banking information, and phone number—online. Doxxing is usually performed with malicious intent, in an attempt to harass or cause harm to its victims. Sometimes, doxxing is used to blackmail victims into doing something they wouldnʻt normally agree to, such as making a large financial payment to the doxxer.
