- (liquid capital; quick assets; realizable assets) Assets held in cash or in something that can be readily turned into cash with minimal capital loss (e.g. deposits in a bank current account, trade debts, marketable investments). The ratio of these assets to current liabilities provides an assessment of an organization's liquidity or solvency. See also LIQUID RATIO; MANDATORY LIQUID ASSETS.
