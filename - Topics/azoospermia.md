- (aspermia) $n$. the complete absence of sperm from the seminal fluid. This is due either to profound impairment of sperm formation (spermatogenesis) due to damage to the testes (e.g. caused by cryptorchidism, mumps orchitis, or radio- or chemotherapy) or - more commonly - to obstruction of the genital tract (e.g. resulting from vasectomy, gonorrhoea, or Chlamydia infection). A biopsy of the testis is necessary in order to differentiate these two causes of azoospermia; if a blockage is present it may be possible to relieve it surgically (see EPIDIDYMOVASOSTOMY).
