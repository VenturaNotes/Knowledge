- $n$. an enzyme that breaks down a choline ester into its choline and acid components. The term usually refers to acetylcholinesterase, which breaks down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine into choline and acetic acid. It is found in all cholinergic nerve junctions, where it rapidly destroys the acetylcholine released during the transmission of a nerve impulse so that subsequent impulses may pass. Other cholinesterases are found in the blood and other tissues.
## Source[^2]
- (acetylcholinesterase) An enzyme that hydrolyses the neurotransmitter acetylcholine to choline and acetate. Cholinesterase is secreted by nerve cells at synapses and by muscle cells at neuromuscular junctions. Organophosphorus insecticides (see PESTICIDE) act as anticholinesterases by inhibiting the action of cholinesterase.
