### Types of Algorithms
- [[Sorting Algorithm]]
- [[Searching Algorithm]]
- [[Graph Algorithm]]
- [[Divide and Conquer Algorithm]]
- [[greedy algorithms|greedy algorithm]]
- [[Dynamic Programming]]
- [[Backtracking Algorithm]]
- [[Machine Learning Algorithm]]

### Examples of Algorithms
- [[QuickSort]] (Sorting Algorithm) – A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot and partitions the array around it.
- [[Binary Search]] (Searching Algorithm) – Searches for an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search range in half.
- [[dijkstra's algorithm]] (Graph Algorithm) – Finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.
- [[Merge Sort|mergesort]] (Divide and Conquer) – Recursively divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back.
- [[Knapsack Problem]] (Dynamic Programming / Greedy) – Determines the optimal way to fill a knapsack with items of varying value and weight.
- [[A* Algorithm]] (Pathfinding) – A graph traversal algorithm used in AI for finding the shortest path.
- [[K-Means Clustering]] (Machine Learning) – Groups data into clusters based on similarity.
- [[Minimax Algorithm]] (Game Theory) – Used in decision-making for games like chess, minimizing the opponent's advantage while maximizing one's own.
