### Examples of Algorithms
- [[QuickSort]] (Sorting Algorithm) – A divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot and partitions the array around it.
- [[Binary Search]] (Searching Algorithm) – Searches for an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search range in half.
- [[dijkstra's algorithm]] (Graph Algorithm) – Finds the shortest path between nodes in a weighted graph.
- [[Merge Sort|mergesort]] (Divide and Conquer) – Recursively divides the array into halves, sorts them, and merges them back.
- [[Knapsack Problem]] (Dynamic Programming / Greedy) – Determines the optimal way to fill a knapsack with items of varying value and weight.
- [[A* Algorithm]] (Pathfinding) – A graph traversal algorithm used in AI for finding the shortest path.
- [[K-Means Clustering]] (Machine Learning) – Groups data into clusters based on similarity.
- [[Minimax Algorithm]] (Game Theory) – Used in decision-making for games like chess, minimizing the opponent's advantage while maximizing one's own.

## Source[^2]
- An algorithm is a set of rules or a step-by-step procedure for solving a problem or performing a task, particularly in computing.
## Source[^3]
- A precisely described routine procedure that can be applied and systematically followed through to a conclusion. The word derives from the mathematician Khwārizmī
## Source[^4]
- A finite and well-defined sequence of steps that need to be followed to perform a task.
## Source[^5]
- An algorithm is a procedure used for solving a problem or performing a computation.

## Source[^6]
- A prescribed set of well-defined rules or instructions for the solution of a problem, such as the performance of a calculation, in a finite number of steps. Expressing an algorithm in a formal notation is one of the main parts of a program; much that is said about programs applies to algorithms, and vice versa. An effective algorithm is one that is effectively computable (see EFFECTIVE COMPUTABILITY). The study of whether effective algorithms exist to compute particular quantities forms the basis of the theory of algorithms.
- Save for the simplest of algorithms it is difficult to prove that an algorithm is correct (see PROGRAM CORRECTNESS PROOF), or even to specify the effect it is intended to achieve. In practice it is usually necessary to be content with algorithm validation. This process certifies, or verifies, that an algorithm will perform the calculation required of it. It involves testing the routine against a variety of instances of the problem and ensuring that it performs satisfactorily for these test cases. If the test set is chosen sufficiently well there can then be confidence in the algorithm.
- [[Algorithm analysis]] is the study of the performance characteristics of a given algorithm. One branch of this study, [[average-case analysis]], examines the average behavior of the algorithm. [[Worst-case analysis]] studies the behavior when all circumstances are as unfavorable as possible. Algorithms can be analyzed in terms of their complexity and efficiency, where algorithm efficiency is characterized by its order.

## Source[^7]
- An algorithm is a set of instructions that tells a computer system how to solve a problem or perform a computation. Algorithms help computer systems find the best way to solve a problem by sorting and processing large amounts of data. Algorithms enable computers to automatically make decisions and execute them accordingly.
## Source[^8]
- A set of well-defined rules for solving a problem in a finite number of steps. Algorithms are extensively used in computer science. The steps in the algorithm are translated into a series of instructions that the computer can understand. These instructions form the computer program.
## Source[^9]
- $n$. Any well-defined computational procedure that takes a value or set of values as input and, after a finite sequence of computational steps, produces a value or set of values as output. Computer programs are the most familiar examples of algorithms, and another useful definition of an algorithm is any operation that can be carried out by a Turing machine. Also, more generally and informally, any step-by-step procedure for finding the unique solution to a problem. Compare heuristic. \[From Arabic alKhwārazmi a native of Khwārazm (Khiva), the name by which the ninth-century Arab mathematician Abu Ja'far Mohommed ben Musa came to be known]
## Source[^10]
- $n$. a sequential set of instructions used in calculations or problem solving. A reconstruction algorithm is a complex mathematical formula used by a computer to construct images from the data acquired by CT, MRI, or other scanners. A diagnostic algorithm or a therapeutic algorithm consists of a stepwise series of instructions with branching pathways to be followed to assist a physician in coming to a diagnosis or deciding on a management strategy, respectively.
