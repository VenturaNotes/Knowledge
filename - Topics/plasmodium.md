- (pl. plasmodia) A mass of cytoplasm containing many nuclei that comprises a stage in the life cycle of a plasmodial slime mould. The plasmodium is the vegetative phase of the slime mould, often seen as a slimy layer on decaying wood; it is capable of slow amoeboid movement and feeds by engulfing particles of decaying organic matter.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a genus of protozoans (see SPOROZOA) that live as parasites within human red blood cells and liver cells. The parasite undergoes its asexual development (see SCHIZOGONY) in humans and completes the sexual phase of its development (see SPOROGONY) in the stomach and digestive glands of a bloodsucking Anopheles mosquito. Four species cause malaria: P. vivax, P. ovale, P. falciparum, and P. malariae.
