- (pl. plasmodia) A mass of cytoplasm containing many nuclei that comprises a stage in the life cycle of a plasmodial slime mould. The plasmodium is the vegetative phase of the slime mould, often seen as a slimy layer on decaying wood; it is capable of slow amoeboid movement and feeds by engulfing particles of decaying organic matter.
