- $n$. an overgrowth of fibrous scar tissue following trauma to the skin. It does not resolve spontaneously but may be flattened by silicone gels, applied pressure, injections of potent corticosteroids, or intralesional excision (or combinations of these). Keloid formation is particularly common at certain sites, such as the breastbone or ear lobe; surgical excision of benign (nonmalignant) lesions from such sites is therefore best avoided. See also SCAR.
