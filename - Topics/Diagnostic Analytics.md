- Diagnostic analytics is a type of advanced data analytics to determine why a particular past event happened. Diagnostic analytics takes a look at historical data and uses techniques such as data discovery (collecting data and identifying trends and patterns in that data). It also uses data mining (finding anomalies and patterns in large data sets) and drill-down (revealing extra levels of detail from data sets).
