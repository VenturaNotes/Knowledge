- 4G, or fourth-generation wireless, is as much as seven times faster than the previous 3G technology (100 Mbps versus 14 Mbps). Each wireless generation is held to its own set of standards when it comes to technological interoperability and data transmission speeds. For 4G, it must include data rates of around 100 Mbps, Internet Protocol-based technology, and the use of OFMDA or FDE transmissions.
