- (quango) A form of organization used when it is desired to provide government finance for an activity without making the day-to-day details of its operations subject to direct political control, and without making government ministers responsible for them. Governments appoint the governing bodies of quangos, and lay down their general objectives, but then entrust detailed decisions to their discretion. In the UK, for example, quangos include the Arts Council and various research councils.
