## Source[^3]
- In the elimination method, you either add or subtract the equations to get an equation in one variable

## Source[^4]
- A method of solving linear simultaneous equations by reducing the number of variables by taking appropriate linear combinations of the equations. For example, when $3x+2y = 7$ (I) and $5x-3y = -1$ (II) then $3 \times (I) + 2 \times (II) \implies 19x = 19$, so the variable $y$ has been eliminated, allowing the variable $x$ to be identified as $1$, and then the substitution back into either of the original equations gives the corresponding value for $y$.
