## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. one of a group of compounds occurring in the myelin sheaths of nerve fibers. They are glycolipids, containing a sphingolipid bound to a sugar, usually galactose (in galactocerebrosides) or glucose (in glucocerebrosides).
## Source[^2]
- Any one of a class of glycolipids in which a single sugar unit is bound to a sphingolipid (see PHOSPHOLIPID). The most common cerebrosides are galactocerebrosides, containing the sugar group galactose; they are found in the plasma membranes of neural tissue and are abundant in the myelin sheaths of neurons.
