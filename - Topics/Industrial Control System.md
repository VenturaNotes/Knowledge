- An industry control system (ICS) is a term used in the industrial sector to describe the various control systems and machinery that automate various industrial manufacturing, production, distribution, and product handling workflows. Supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, industrial automation and control systems (IACS), and distributed control systems (DCS) are examples of ICS systems. A few common machines involved in ICS systems include programmable logic controllers (PLCs), remote terminal units (RTUs), intelligent electronic devices (IEDs), and control servers. ICSs support the infrastructure of companies that work within the manufacturing, transportation, water treatment, and energy industries.
