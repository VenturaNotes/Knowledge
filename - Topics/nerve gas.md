- any gas that disrupts the normal functioning of nerves and thus of the muscles they supply. There are two groups, the $\mathbf{G}$ agents and the $\mathbf{V}$ agents. The latter are more than 300 times as deadly as mustard gas: one inhalation can kill by paralysing the respiratory muscles. V agents also act through the skin, therefore gas masks are ineffective protection against them.

- $n$. Any gas, especially an organophosphate anticholinesterase agent such as sarin (isopropyl methylphosphonofluoridate) or the more potent agent VX, that may be used as a chemical weapon and that, if absorbed through the skin or inhaled, occupies the active sites of acetylcholinesterase molecules and thereby interferes with the enzyme's ability to break down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine after nerve impulses, causing the neurotransmitter to accumulate at the synapses (1) between motor nerve fibres and muscles, and leading to muscle cramps and asphyxia. Also called a nerve agent. See also neurotoxin.
