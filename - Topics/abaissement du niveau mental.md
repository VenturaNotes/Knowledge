- n. In analytical psychology, a reduced state of concentration and attention, accompanied by a loosening of inhibitions and relaxation of restraints, in which unexpected contents may emerge from the unconscious (2). It usually occurs spontaneously but can be deliberately encouraged in preparation for active imagination. Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) borrowed the term from his teacher, the French psychologist and neurologist Pierre Janet (1859-1947). \[French: literally reduction of mental level\]
