- (1) a chronic disease of bones, occurring in the elderly and most frequently affecting the skull, backbone, pelvis, and long bones. Affected bones become thickened and their structure disorganized: X-rays reveal patchy sclerosis. There are often no symptoms, but pain, deformity, and fracture can occur; when the skull is affected, blindness and deafness can occur due to nerve compression. There is a very small (1%) risk of malignant change (osteosarcoma). Treatment is with bisphosphonates. Medical name: osteitis deformans. 
- (2) a malignant condition of the nipple, resembling eczema in appearance, associated with underlying infiltrating cancer of the breast. See also BREAST CANCER. 
- (3) an uncommon condition of the vulva characterized by an epithelial lesion that histologically resembles the lesion of Paget's disease of the nipple. It may be associated with locally invasive adenocarcinomas of the surrounding skin, as well as tumors at other sites. \[Sir J. Paget (1814-99), British surgeon]
