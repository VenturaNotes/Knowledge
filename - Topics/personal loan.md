- A loan to a private person by a bank or building society for domestic purposes, buying a car, etc. There is usually no security required and consequently a high rate of interest is charged. Repayment is usually by monthly instalments over a fixed period. This is a more expensive way of borrowing from a bank than by means of an overdraft.

- A loan, usually from a bank, to an individual, who is not necessarily required to produce any specific collateral for it. Personal loans are widely used to finance the purchase of expensive items such as cars and furniture, and are usually a cheaper method of financing than hire purchase. Repayment is usually at an agreed rate over a period of months or years. Personal loans are riskier for the lenders than secured loans such as mortgages, and normally bear higher interest rates.
