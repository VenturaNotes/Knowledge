- A WAN (wide-area network) is a communications network accessible across a large area, even globally. Whereas a local area network (LAN) is limited to one building, WANs are networks that large enterprises use to communicate, send data, and provide resources to individuals and groups worldwide. WANs can be accessed through a virtual private network (VPN), a leasing arrangement, a wireless network, or a cell phone network. A type of WAN that’s virtual or cloud-based is called an SD-WAN, which uses specific software (software-defined or SD). The internet is also considered a WAN.
