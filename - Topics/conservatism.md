- A prudent and not overoptimistic view of the state of affairs of a company or other organization. Because it is regarded as imprudent to distribute to shareholders profits that may not materialize, it is a general principle of accounting not to anticipate profits before they are realized but to anticipate losses as soon as they become foreseeable. See also PRUDENCE CONCEPT.
