## Source [^1]
- Any enzyme that catalyses the removal of hydrogen atoms (dehydrogenation) in biological reactions. Dehydrogenases occur in many biochemical pathways but are particularly important in driving the electron-transport-chain reactions of cell respiration. They work in conjunction with the hydrogen-accepting coenzymes $\mathrm{NAD}^{+}$ and $\mathrm{FAD}^{+}$.
