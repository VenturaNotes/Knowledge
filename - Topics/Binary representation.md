- The representation of a number to base 2. It uses just the two binary digits 0 and 1 , and this is the reason why it is important in computing. For example, $37=100101_{2}$, since$$37=\left(1 \times 2^{5}\right)+\left(0 \times 2^{4}\right)+(0 \times 2)^{3}+\left(1 \times 2^{2}\right)+(0 \times 2)+1$$

- Real numbers, not just integers, can also be written in binary notation, by using binary digits after a 'binary' point, just as familiar decimal representations of real numbers are written to base 10 . For example, the number $\frac{1}{10}$, which equals 0.1 in decimal notation, has, in binary notation, a recurring representation: $0.00011001100110011\ldots_2$.
