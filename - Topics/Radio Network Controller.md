- The RNC is a critical part in the modern cellular phone network; it manages what is called the B nodes in a cellular network. Â Cell phones communicate via nodes. Nodes and RNCs together make up the universal terrestrial radio access network or UTRAN. The whole network ties together RNCs, user equipment (usually a cell phone), and other core aspects of the network.
