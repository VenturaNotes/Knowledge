- (niche marketing) A comparatively small segment of a market that has been identified, usually by a small company, in which to concentrate their efforts. For example, a company might decide to offer a service converting old cine films to DVD; as long as this activity does not threaten the profitability of the manufacturers of DVDs or anyone still selling cine films, it can establish a profitable niche in the market.
