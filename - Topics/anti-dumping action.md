- The procedure by which complaints of dumping are investigated and the case for the imposition of anti-dumping duties is assessed. Anti-dumping actions are instigated by importing countries. A tariff commission or similar body investigates whether dumping has occurred, and whether it is causing injury to the domestic industry. Given the lack of any agreed definition of dumping, and the probable lack of impartiality in national tribunals judging cases between domestic complainants and foreign suppliers, the threat of anti-dumping actions has an all-round protectionist effect.
