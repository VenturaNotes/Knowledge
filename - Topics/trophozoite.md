- $n$. a stage in the life cycle of the malarial parasite (Plasmodium) that develops from a merozoite in the red blood cells. The trophozoite, which has a ring-shaped body and a single nucleus, grows steadily at the expense of the blood cell; eventually its nucleus and cytoplasm undergo division to form a schizont containing many merozoites.
