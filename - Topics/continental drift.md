- The theory that the earth's continents once formed a single mass and have since moved relative to each other. It was first postulated by A. Snider in 1858 and greatly developed by Alfred Wegener (1880-1930) in 1912. He used evidence, such as the fit of South America into Africa and the distribution of rock types, flora, fauna, and geological structures, to suggest that the present distribution of the continents results from the breaking up of one or two greater land masses. The original land mass was named Pangaea and it was suggested that this broke up into the northerly Laurasia and the southerly Gondwanaland (see illustration). The theory was not accepted for about 50 years by the majority of geologists but during the early 1960s, the seafloor-spreading hypothesis of Harry Hess (1906-69) and the subsequent development of plate tectonics produced a mechanism to explain the drift of the continents.
