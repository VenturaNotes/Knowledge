- (static risk) The possibility of suffering some form of loss or damage that can be described sufficiently accurately for a calculation to be made of the probability of its happening, on the basis of past records. Fire, theft, accident, etc., are all insurable risks because underwriters can assess the probability of having to pay out a claim and can therefore calculate a reasonable premium. If the risk is met so infrequently that no way of calculating the probability of the event exists, no underwriter will insure against it and it is therefore an uninsurable risk.
