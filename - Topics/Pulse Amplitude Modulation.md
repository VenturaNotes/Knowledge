- Pulse amplitude modulation (PAM) is a type of signal modulation. With PAM, data from a message is found in the amplitude of a signal. This allows for content and data to be placed within a signal to make it easier to send the data. PAM has many common uses. Ethernet and many forms of digital communication (e.g., digital television) leverage PAM.
