- a state in which the pressure within the hepatic portal vein is increased, causing enlargement of the spleen, development of oesophageal varices (with increased risk of bleeding), and accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity (ascites). The commonest cause is liver cirrhosis, but other diseases of the liver or thrombosis of the portal vein may precipitate portal hypertension. Treatment includes diuretics, band ligation or beta blockers for varices, and transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPSS). This involves the radiological implantation of a stent that bridges the portal and hepatic veins, thus decompressing the portal system. TIPSS has largely replaced portacaval anastomosis.
