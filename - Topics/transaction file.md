- Another name for a transaction file is a movement file
- A file, especially a data file, containing transaction records, prior to the updating of a master file. Transaction files are only used in batch processing systems. Once updating has been carried out, the transaction file may be kept in order to permit subsequent recovery of the master file (see FILE RECOVERY) or for auditing purposes but is otherwise redundant
