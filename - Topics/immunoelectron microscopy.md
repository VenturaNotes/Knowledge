- A form of transmission electron microscopy (see ELECTRON MICROSCOPE) in which the specimen is treated with gold-labelled antibodies specific for the protein component of interest. The gold labels are then revealed as electron-dense dark areas on the image. Labelling with different-sized gold particles can enable two different components to be visualized simultaneously. However, because the sections of material used are ultra-thin, only relatively few labels are likely to be bound in any one section.
