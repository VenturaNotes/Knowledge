- $n$. In statistics, a method of multiple comparisons in which all possible $t$ tests between group means are performed without adjustment of the significance levels for the fact that multiple, non-independent comparisons are being made, and therefore without adequate protection against a Type I error. Compare Bonferroni correction, Duncan's multiple range test, Newman-Keuls test, Scheff√© test, Tukey-HSD test.
