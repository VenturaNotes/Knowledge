## Source [^1]
- A term that refers to the presence of two complete sets of chromosomes in an organism's cells, with each parent contribute a chromosome to each pair
- Humans are diploid, and most of the body's cells contain 23 chromosomes pairs
## Source[^2]
- adj. describing cells, nuclei, or organisms in which each chromosome except the Y sex chromosome is represented twice. Compare HAPLOID; TRIPLOID. â€”diploid $n$.
## Source[^3]
- Describing a nucleus, cell, or organism with twice the haploid number of chromosomes characteristic of the species. The diploid number is designated as $2 n$. Two sets of chromosomes are present, one set being derived from the female parent and the other from the male. In animals, all the cells except the reproductive cells are diploid.
## Source[^4]
- adj. Of or relating to a cell that has a full complement of paired chromosomes, such as a body or somatic cell of humans and most sexually reproducing animals, rather than half the normal number, as in sex cells or gametes; also of or relating to an organism whose body cells contain paired chromosomes. Compare haplodiploid, haploid. diploidy $n$. The state or condition of being diploid. \[From Greek diploos double + -oeides denoting resemblance of form, from eidos shape]
