- $n$. inflammation of a finger or toe caused by bone infection (as in tuberculous osteomyelitis) or rheumatic diseases, such as spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, or sarcoidosis or seen in infants with sickle-cell disease. The whole digit is swollen and may resemble a sausage (known as 'sausage digit'). The diffuse swelling arises from the flexor tendon, its sheath, and adjacent soft tissue.
