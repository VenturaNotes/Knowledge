- ($\mathbf{Z}$ band) The thin membrane that separates adjacent sarcomeres in the fibres of skeletal (striated) muscle. It is visible under an electron microscope as a thin dark line in the middle of a lighter band. The center point of each thin (actin) filament is anchored to the Z line and exerts a pull on the membrane when the fiber contracts.
