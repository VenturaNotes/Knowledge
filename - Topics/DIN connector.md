- DIN is short for Deutsches Institut f√ºr Normung eV, the standards-setting organization for Germany. A DIN connector is a connector that conforms to one of the many standards defined by DIN. These connectors are used widely in personal computers and audio equipment. The ubiquitous round DIN connector and its miniature cousin (the mini DIN connector) are two of a wide range of connectors with from three to more than one hundred pins.
