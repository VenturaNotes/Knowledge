- A particular 'oval' shape, informally obtained by stretching or squashing a circle. If it has length $2a$ and width $2b$, its area equals $\pi ab.$
- More precisely, we may define an ellipse as a conic with eccentricity less than 1. Thus, it is the locus of all points P such that the distance from $P$ to a fixed point $F_1$ (the focus) equals $e$ $(<1)$ times the distance from $P$ to a fixed line $l_1$ (the directrix). It turns out that there is another point $F_2$ and another line $l_2$ such that the same locus would be obtained with these as focus and directrix. An ellipse is also the conic section that results when a plane cuts a cone in such a way that a bounded section is obtained (see CONIC).
- The line through $F_1$ and $F_2$ is the major axis, and the points $V_1$ and $V_2$ where it cuts the ellipse are the vertices. The length $|V_1V_2|$ is the length of the major axis and is usually taken to be $2a$. The midpoint of $V_1V_2$ is the center of the ellipse. The line through the center perpendicular to the major axis is the minor axis, and the distance, usually taken to be $2b$, between the points where it cuts the ellipse is the length of the minor axis. The three constants $a, b,$ and $e$ are related by $e^2 = 1 - b^2/a^2$. The eccentricity $e$ determines the shape of the ellipse. The value $e=0$ is permitted and gives rise to a circle, though this requires the directrices to be infinitely far away, invaliding the focus and directrix description.

	- An ellipse in normal form
- By taking a coordinate system with origin at the center of the ellipse and x-axis along the major axis, the foci have coordinates $(ae, 0)$ and $(-ae, 0)$, the directrices have equations $x=a/e$ and $x = -a/e$, and the ellipse has equation $$\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{b^2}=1$$where $a > b > 0$ (see NORMAL FORM). This ellipse may be parametrized by $x = a \text{cos}\theta, y = b\text{cos}\theta(0 \le \theta \lt 2\pi)$ as parametric equations

	- Ellipse highlighting property (ii)
- The ellipse has two important properties:
	- (i) If P is any point of the ellipse with foci $F_1$ ad $F_2$ and length of major axis $2a$, then $|PF_1| + |PF_2| = 2a$. The fact that an ellipse can be seen as the locus of all such points is the basis of a practical method of drawing an ellipse using a string between two points.
	- (ii) For any point $P$ on the ellipse, let $\alpha$ be the angle between the tangent at $P$ and the line $PF_1$, and $\beta$ the angle between the tangent at $P$ and the line $PF_2$, as shown in the figure; then $\alpha = \beta$. This property is analogous to that of the parabolic reflector (see PARABOLA).
