- A mathematically formal approach to the description of software that addresses the specification of a set of concurrent processes and the way in which they interact; it was developed by Tony Hoare. The means of interaction is limited to a ‘synchronous’ protocol in which any pair of communicating processes must be simultaneously involved for communication to be achieved.
