- n. a genus of small parasitic tapeworms that reach a maximum length of only 8 mm . Adults are found in the intestines of dogs, wolves, or jackals. If the eggs are swallowed by a human, who can act as a secondary host, the resulting larvae penetrate the intestine and settle in the lungs, liver, or brain to form large cysts, usually $5-10 \mathrm{~cm}$ in diameter (see HYDATID DISEASE). Two species causing this condition are E. granulosus and E. multilocularis.
