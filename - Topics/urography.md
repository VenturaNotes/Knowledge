- $n$. radiological examination of the urinary tract. This traditionally involves the injection of radiopaque contrast material and observation of the flow with X-rays (see CYSTOGRAPHY; INTRAVENOUS UROGRAPHY; PYELOGRAPHY; URETHROGRAPHY). In CT urography contrast is injected in the vein and CT of the urinary tract acquired when the contrast arrives there. The technique is used in haematuria to exclude the presence of a tumor within the renal pelvis, ureter, or bladder. MR urography is used to visualize the urinary tract by magnetic resonance imaging. An MR contrast medium is injected into a peripheral vein and passes to the kidneys and ureters, when images of thin sections can be obtained. These can be manipulated by computer to reveal the anatomy and any pathology (e.g. stones, tumors) of the imaged structures. MR urography is particularly useful in children.
