## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
- $A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing$
	- Intersection with any set
- $A \cup \varnothing = A$
	- Union with any set

## Source[^2]
### Intersection Identity
- $A \cap \varnothing = \varnothing$
### Union Identity
- $A \cup \varnothing = A$
## Source[^3]
- the empty set is a subset of every set
	- This includes the empty set being a subset of the empty set
		- $\{\} \subseteq \{\}$

## Source[^4]
- The empty set has no elements
- $\varnothing := \{\}$
