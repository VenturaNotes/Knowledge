- $n$. a threadlike keratinized outgrowth of the epidermis of the skin. It develops inside a tubular hair follicle. The part above the skin consists of three layers: an outer cuticle; a cortex, forming the bulk of the hair and containing the pigment that gives the hair its color; and a central core (medulla), which may be hollow. The root of the hair, beneath the surface of the skin, is expanded at its base to form the bulb, which contains a matrix of dividing cells. As new cells are formed the older ones are pushed upwards and become keratinized to form the root and shaft. A hair may be raised by a small erector muscle in the dermis, attached to the hair follicle.

- (1) A multicellular threadlike structure, consisting of many dead keratinized cells, that is produced by the epidermis in mammalian skin. The section of a hair below the skin surface (the root) is contained within a hair follicle, the base of which produces the hair cells. Hair assists in maintaining body temperature by reducing heat loss from the skin. Bristles and whiskers are specialized types of hair. 
- (2) Any of various threadlike structures on plants, such as a trichome.
