- Web 3.0 (also known as Web3) can be described as an evolved version of the World Wide Web that leverages machine learning, artificial intelligence (AI), and blockchain technologies to further the future of the internet. Instead of having a central authority that governs the activities that take place on the web, Web 3.0 will use blockchain technology to allow web users to directly interact with each other without intermediaries. Web user data will be stored in smart contracts that are coded into a blockchain, increasing data privacy. This blockchain will be managed by decentralized computer nodes, similar to how cryptocurrencies are managed today. Web 3.0 will also be cryptocurrency-enabled, replacing fiat currency with the cryptocurrencies due to their decentralized design. One of the most appealing aspects of Web 3.0 is that it will allow individuals to own their own data and be paid for their time spent browsing the internet.
