- $n$. A pattern of relationship interdependence in which close partners influence each other's dispositions, values, and behavioral patterns in such a manner as to bring both people closer to their ideal selves. The concept was introduced by the US psychologist Stephen Michael Drigotas (born 1966) and several collaborators in an article in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology in 1999 reporting the results of four experiments designed to elucidate the phenomenon. \[Named after the Italian sculptor Michelangelo Buonarroti (1475-1564) who is said to have conceived of sculpture as a process of bringing out figures already hidden in stone by chipping away the excess]
