- $n$. the creation of an opening in a dividing wall or membrane. For example, this procedure may be performed in cases of twin-to-twin transfusion syndrome. Using a fine needle, a small hole is made in the membrane dividing the twins to allow amniotic fluid to flow from one twin to the other, thus equalizing the amount of fluid between them.
