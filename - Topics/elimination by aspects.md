- $n$. A theory of multi-attribute decision making, introduced in 1972 by the Israeli-American psychologist Amos Tversky (1937-96), according to which a choice is reached through an iterated series of eliminations. At each iteration, the decision maker selects an attribute (aspect), the probability of selection being proportional to the attribute's perceived importance, and eliminates all alternatives lacking that attribute, then selects the next most important attribute and proceeds in the same way, and so on until all but one of the alternatives have been eliminated. It is a stochastic version of lexicographic choice, and although it is not guaranteed to produce an optimal choice it appears from experimental tests to be characteristic of human multi-attribute decision making.
