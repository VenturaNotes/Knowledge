- $n$. a glucose polymer solution produced by the hydrolysis of cornstarch and containing a spectrum of polymer molecules with an average molecular weight of 16,200 Da. It is used in the dialysate treatment of renal failure by peritoneal dialysis. It exerts a strong osmotic effect, allowing removal of fluid without exposing the peritoneum to high levels of glucose. It is of most use when the dialysate is required to remain within the body for a long period, for instance overnight during chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis or during the day with automated peritoneal dialysis.
