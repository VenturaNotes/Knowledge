- (Fed funds rate) The highly volatile and sensitive interest rate charged between member banks of the Federal Reserve System. As the overnight rate paid on Federal funds, it is a key indicator of money-market interest rates. Every transaction can alter the level at which the rate is fixed. In practice the Federal Open Market Committee sets a target rate as part of its monetary policy, which is then enforced through open-market operations.
