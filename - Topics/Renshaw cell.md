- A type of inhibitory interneuron found in feedback circuits in the central nervous system that control the level of excitation of motor neurons. The Renshaw cells receive input from side branches (collaterals) of motor axons and in turn form inhibitory synapses with the motor-neuron cell bodies. Strychnine blocks transmission at the glycinergic inhibitory synapses of Renshaw cells, causing convulsions and death from paralysis of respiratory muscles. These cells are named after the US neurophysiologist B. Renshaw (1911â€“48).
