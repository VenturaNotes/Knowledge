- A function defined (explicitly rather than implicitly) in such a way that there is a rule that describes how the effect of the function can be realized; such functions are utilized by mathematicians who adopt an intuitionist or constructionist view of their subject. For example, it is inadequate to say that cube roots can be derived by solving a cubic equation of the form $x^{3}=a$. It is necessary to give guidance on how cube roots can be evaluated.
