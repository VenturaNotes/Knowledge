- A directed graph that represents a finite group; the vertices of the graph represent elements of the group and the edges represent generators of the group. If edge $E$ (representing generator $g$ ) joins vertices $V$ and $V^{\prime}$ (representing group elements $v$ and $v^{\prime}$ respectively) then$$v^{\circ} g=v^{\prime}$$where ${ }^{\circ}$ is the group operation. Each vertex of the group graph will have outdegree (see DEGREE) equal to the number of generators of the group.
