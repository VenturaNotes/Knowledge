- A tax proportional to the price of the object being taxed. An example is the value-added tax (VAT) levied in the European Union. In contrast, a specific tax is levied at a rate per unit of quantity, independent of the price, such as, for example, some excise duties. Ad valorem taxes have the advantageous feature that their real value is not eroded by inflation.
