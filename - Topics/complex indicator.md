- $n$. In analytical psychology, an aspect of a person's response to a word-association test that is suggestive of a complex (2). Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961), who popularized the test, listed the main complex indicators in an article entitled 'The Association Method' in the American Journal of Psychology in 1910: an unusual reaction to a word, such as laughing or blushing, an abnormally long reaction time, a repetition of the stimulus word, an absurd or far-fetched association, and a failure to respond to a stimulus word.
