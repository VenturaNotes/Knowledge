## Source [^1]
- A lazy functional language (see LAZY EVALUATION) developed in the early 1990s as a common basis for research and to consolidate the large number of such languages being invented at the time. It has become one of the most popular functional languages (after ML) and in recent years has influenced the design of new features in existing nonfunctional languages.
