- $n$. The law according to which relative gene frequencies in a population remain stable from generation to generation provided that mating occurs randomly and there is no selection (1), migration, or mutation. If the relative frequency of one allele at a particular gene locus is $p$ and that of another is $q$, then it is easy to prove that the population will contain $p^{2}$ homozygotes with two $p$ genes, $q^{2}$ homozygotes with two $q$ genes, and $2 p q$ heterozygotes with one $p$ and one $q$ gene. See also balanced POlymorphism, population genetics. \[Named after the English mathematician G(odfrey) H(arold) Hardy (1877-1947) and the German physician Wilhelm Weinberg (1862-1937) who discovered the law independently of each other in 1908]
