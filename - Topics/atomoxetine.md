- $n$. The generic name of a drug for the treatment of attentiondeficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), developed by Eli Lilly and first marketed in January 2003. It is administered in the form atomoxetine hydrochloride, and some doctors and patients prefer it to methylphenidate (Ritalin) because it has milder side-effects, being a selective noradrenalin reuptake inhibitor and not a stimulant drug, and because it is suitable for use by adults as well as children. Formerly named tomoxetine. Commonly called Strattera (trademark). Formula: $\mathrm{C}_{17} \mathrm{H}_{21} \mathrm{NO}$.
