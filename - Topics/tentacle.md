- Any of the soft flexible appendages in aquatic invertebrate animals that are used principally for feeding. Water flows over the tentacles, which are able to capture food and direct it to the oral aperture. Tentacles are possessed by many cnidarians, some echinoderms (including sea cucumbers), and by cephalopod molluscs, in which the tentacles bear rows of suckers.
