- The nerves of the autonomic nervous system that control the diameter of blood vessels. Vasoconstrictor nerves of the sympathetic division decrease the diameter and cause vasoconstriction. Inhibition of these by nerves of the parasympathetic division leads to relaxation of smooth muscle in blood vessel walls, as does direct stimulation by vasodilator nerves (see vasODILATION).
