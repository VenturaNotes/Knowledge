- $n$. surgical repair of the urethra, especially a urethral stricture. Anastomotic urethroplasty is used for a short stricture: the area of narrowing is excised and the two adjacent ends are then joined directly to each other. A substitution urethroplasty entails the insertion of a flap or patch of skin from the scrotum or a buccal mucosal graft into the urethra at the site of the stricture, which is laid widely open. The operation can be performed in one stage, although two stages are usual in the reconstruction of a posterior urethral stricture (see URETHROSTOMY). Transpubic urethroplasty is performed to repair a ruptured posterior urethra following a fractured pelvis. Access to the damaged urethra is achieved by partial removal of the pubic bone.
