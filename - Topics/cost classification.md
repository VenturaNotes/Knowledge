- The process of grouping expenditure according to common characteristics. Costs are initially divided into capital expenditure and revenue expenditure. In a production organization the revenue expenditure is classified sequentially to enable a product cost to build up in the order in which these costs tend to be incurred. Revenue costs would normally include:
	- direct material,
	- direct labour,
	- direct expenses,
	- production overheads,
	- administration overheads,
	- selling overheads,
	- distribution overheads,
	- research overheads.
