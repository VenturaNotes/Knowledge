- any one of the many types into which a person's blood may be classified, based on the presence or absence of certain inherited antigens on the surface of the red blood cells. Blood of one group contains antibodies in the serum that react against the cells of other groups.
- There are more than 30 blood group systems, one of the most important of which is the ABO system. This system is based on the presence or absence of antigens A and B: blood of groups A and B contains antigens A and $B$, respectively; group $A B$ contains both antigens and group $O$ neither. Blood of group A contains antibodies to antigen B; group B blood contains anti-A antibodies or isoagglutinins; group AB has neither antibody and group O has both. A person whose blood contains either (or both) of these antibodies cannot receive a transfusion of blood containing the corresponding antigens. The table illustrates which blood groups can be used in transfusion for each of the four groups.

| Blood group         |                                                    |                                               |

- $n$. Any of the blood types identified by the many classification systems, especially one of the four types of the ABO system based on the presence or absence of two genetically determined antigens, A and B, on the surface of red blood cells. Type A shows the A antigen and an antibody to the B antigen called anti-B agglutinin, Type B shows the B antigen and anti-A agglutinin, Type AB shows both antigens and neither agglutinin, and Type O shows neither antigen and both agglutinins. Also called blood type. See also RACE (2).
