- A tax with a single rate on the taxable amount, after accounting for any deductions or exemptions from the tax base.

## Source[^2]
- A flat tax where everyone pays the same percentage is not the most equitable income tax structure
- A flat tax guarantees that wealthy families' total state and local tax bill will be a lower share of their income than that paid by families of more modest means
- Most taxes levied by state and local governments are regressive, meaning that they charge higher rates, relative to income, for low- and middle-income taxpayers than for wealthy families
- Income taxes offer an important counterbalance as they tend to be progressive, which means that they ask more of families with a greater ability to pay
