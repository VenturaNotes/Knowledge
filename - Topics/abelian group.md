- abelian group: Suppose that G is a group with the operation $\circ$. Then G is abelian if the operation $\circ$ is commutative; that is, if, for all elements $a$ and $b$ in $G$, a $\circ$ b = b $\circ$ a. In an abelian group, the operation is usually denoted $+$.

- abelian group: (Classification theorem) A finite abelian group is isomorphic to the product group $C_{d_{1}} \times C_{d_{2}} \times \ldots \times C_{d_{k}}$ for unique integers $d_{1}, d_{2}, \ldots d_{k} \geqslant 2$ such that $d_{1}\left|d_{2}\right|$ $\ldots \mid d_{k}$. Thus, there are five abelian groups of order $240=2^{4} \cdot 3 \cdot 5$, namely $C_{240}, C_{2} \times C_{120}$, $C_{4} \times C_{60}, C_{2} \times C_{2} \times C_{60}, C_{2} \times C_{2} \times C_{2} \times C_{30}$.
