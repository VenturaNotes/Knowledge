- $n$. a common virus infection mainly affecting school-age children. Symptoms appear 2-3 weeks after exposure: fever, headache, and vomiting may precede a typical swelling of the parotid salivary glands. The gland on one side of the face often swells up days before the other but sometimes only one side is affected. The symptoms usually vanish within three days, the patient remaining infectious until the swelling has completely disappeared, but the infection may spread to other salivary glands and to the pancreas, brain (causing an aseptic meningitis), and testicles (after puberty mumps affecting the testicles can cause sterility). Vaccination against mumps provides effective immunity (see MMR VACCINE). Medical name: infectious parotitis.
