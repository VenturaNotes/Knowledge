- A periodic repetitive waveform that is constrained to lie between a maximum and a minimum value. Between these limits the waveform alternately rises and falls linearly with time. The slope of one of the edges of the waveform is made very much steeper than the other, and the waveform thus appears as a repetitive series of linear ramps. Compare TRIANGULAR WAVEFORM.
