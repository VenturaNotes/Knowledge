## Source [^1]
- An enunciation of the important computing principle that all input, however absurd, will be processed according to a program's algorithms and appropriate output generated. If the input is garbage, then the output will inevitably also be garbage. This truth is often not recognized, especially by non-computer specialists, who tend to blame 'the computer' for incorrect results when the fault actually lies with mistakes in the input.
