- Small and midsize businesses (SMBs; aka small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs) are smaller than large enterprises. Thereâ€™s no standard, formalized description of SMBs or what separates a small business from a midsize one. One guideline to follow is categorizing small businesses as those with fewer than 100 employees and/or less than $50 million in annual revenue, while midsize businesses have fewer than 1,000 employees and/or less than $1 billion in revenue (but more than $50 million).
