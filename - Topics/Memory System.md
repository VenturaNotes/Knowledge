1. Information from sensory inputs, experiences, and learned knowledge is initially processed and integrated in various brain regions.
2. The prefrontal cortex, involved in executive functions and decision-making, plays a role in attention, working memory, and strategic processing of information.
3. The parietal lobe contributes to spatial cognition, attentional control, and integration of sensory inputs relevant to memory encoding and retrieval.
4. The medial temporal lobe, including the hippocampus, is crucial for forming new memories, consolidating them for long-term storage, and retrieving stored memories, particularly episodic and spatial memories.
5. The cerebellum, while primarily associated with motor coordination, contributes indirectly to memory processes by supporting procedural memory, motor learning, timing, sequencing, and error correction during cognitive tasks.
