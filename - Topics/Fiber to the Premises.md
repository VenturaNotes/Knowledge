- FTTP (or Fiber to the Premises) is a communication delivery method that relies on the use of optical fibers instead of traditional copper. This fiber runs directly to the premises (or customerâ€™s location) from the main office of the provider or it can be used to connect an entire office building or other public venue to the main office. Through the use of FTTP, customers can receive the highest possible internet transfer speeds available today.
