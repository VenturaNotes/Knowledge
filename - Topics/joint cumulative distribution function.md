- For two random variables X and Y, the joint cumulative distribution function is the function F defined by $F(x,y) = Pr(X \le x, Y \le y)$. The term applies also to the generalization of this to more than two random variables. For two variables, it may be called the bivariate and, for more than two, the multivariate cumulative distribution function
