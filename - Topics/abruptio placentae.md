- (placental abruption) bleeding from a normally situated placenta causing its complete or partial detachment from the uterine wall after the 24th week of gestation. Abruption is often an unanticipated emergency, as a small bleed (antepartum haemorrhage) can suddenly evolve into a major abruption and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Abruptio placentae is often associated with hypertension and pre-eclampsia.
