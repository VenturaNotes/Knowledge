- $n$. a chemical complex of the pigment portion of haemoglobin (haem) with the plasma protein albumin. It is formed in the blood in such conditions as blackwater fever or paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria, in which red blood cells are destroyed and free haemoglobin is released into the plasma. In such conditions methaemalbumin can be detected in both the blood and urine.
