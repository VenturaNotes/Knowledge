- The basic discrete probability distribution for data in the form of counts of random events. If each event occurs with the same probability and the mean frequency of events is $\mu$, the probability that exactly $r$ events will occur is$$\mathrm{e}^{-\mu} \mu^{r} / r!$$The Poisson distribution is discrete, taking the values $r=0,1,2, \ldots$ and it can be obtained as a limiting case of the binomial distribution as $n$ tends to infinity while $np$ is held fixed. The mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are both equal to $\mu$.
