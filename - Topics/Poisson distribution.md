- The basic discrete probability distribution for data in the form of counts of random events. If each event occurs with the same probability and the mean frequency of events is $\mu$, the probability that exactly $r$ events will occur is$$\mathrm{e}^{-\mu} \mu^{r} / r!$$The Poisson distribution is discrete, taking the values $r=0,1,2, \ldots$ and it can be obtained as a limiting case of the binomial distribution as $n$ tends to infinity while $np$ is held fixed. The mean and variance of the Poisson distribution are both equal to $\mu$.

- $n$. In statistics, a very skewed probability distribution representing the number of discrete events occurring randomly but at a constant average rate in a specified continuous interval of time or space, for example. It is often used to model the random occurrence of rare events with fixed probability of occurrence. \[Named after the French mathematician Siméon-Denis Poisson (1781-1840) who published the results of his researches in a book in 1837]
