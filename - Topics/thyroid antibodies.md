- autoantibodies directed against the cells of the thyroid gland, which serve as a marker of autoimmune thyroid disease. There are two main types: antibodies directed against the thyroid peroxidise (TPO) enzyme; and anti-thyroglobulin, directed against the thyroid colloid (see THYROID GLAND). The highest level of thyroid antibodies is found in Hashimoto's disease.
