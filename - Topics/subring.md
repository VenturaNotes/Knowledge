- Let R be a ring with operations of addition and multiplication. If S is a subset of R that forms a ring with the same operations, then S is a subring of R. For example, the set $\mathbb{Z}$ of all integers forms a subring of the ring $\mathbb{R}$ of all real numbers, and the set of all even integers forms a subring of $\mathbb{Z}$
