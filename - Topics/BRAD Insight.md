- An information service formerly known as British Rates and Data (BRAD), that lists cover price, circulation, frequency, advertising rates, and contact details for national and provincial newspapers and consumer, trade, technical, and professional publications; similar data is also listed for television and radio stations and digital media outlets. BRAD Insight now provides an online service for subscribers, rather than publishing directories. It also compiles the Account List File (ALF), a directory of the UK's top-spending advertisers, their brands, and the agencies they employ (with relevant contacts).
