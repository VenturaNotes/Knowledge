- $n$. Reasoning about obligation and duty, most often in relation to ethical or moral actions, but also in some forms of non-ethical problem solving, to be distinguished from conventional reasoning inasmuch as it is not governed by criteria of conventional logic. For example, the statement If a girl is under the age of 16, then she should not wear lipstick is not true or false in the usual sense but enunciates a deontic conditional rule of conduct. See also DEONTIC, DEONTIC LOGIC, DEONTOLOGY.
