- n. a genus of Gram-positive nonmotile spherical bacteria occurring in chains. Most species are saprophytes; some are pathogenic. Many pathogenic species are haemolytic, i.e. they have the ability to destroy red blood cells in blood agar. This provides a useful basis for classifying the many different strains. Strains of S. pyogenes (the $\beta$-haemolytic streptococci) are associated with many infections, including scarlet fever, and produce many exotoxins. Strains of the $\alpha$-haemolytic streptococci are associated with bacterial endocarditis. The species $S$. pneumoniae (formerly Diplococcus pneumoniae) $\textendash$ the pneumococcus $\textendash$ is associated with serious diseases, including pneumonia, pneumococcal meningitis, and septicaemia; it is also a common bacterial cause of ear infections (see also PNEUMOCOCCAL VACCINE). It occurs in pairs, surrounded by a capsule (see QUEllung REACTION). S. mutans has been shown to cause dental caries. See also Lancefield Classification; STREPTOKINASE. $\textemdash$streptococcal adj.
