- $n$. an intestinal infection of mammals and birds caused by parasitic protozoa of the genus Cryptosporidium, which is usually transmitted to humans via farm animals. Ingestion of water or milk contaminated with infective oocysts results in severe diarrhoea and abdominal cramps, caused by release of a toxin. Most patients recover in 7-14 days, but the disease can persist in the immunocompromised (including AIDS patients), the elderly, and young children.
