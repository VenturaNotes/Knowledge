- (coax) A form of electric cable that consists of a single central conductor surrounded by and insulated from a concentric sheath usually fabricated from an interwoven fine wire mesh. One or more coaxial cables may be included in multicore cable to provide paths for high-frequency or other special signals. The physical dimensions of coax are usually arranged to present a particular characteristic impedance ( 50 ohms or 75 ohms) to electric signals. See also BROADBAND COAXIAL SYSTEMS, ETHERNET.
