- Under the Equality Act 2010 it is generally unlawful for an employer to ask questions about disability or health before making a job offer. The rule, which applies to all enquiries by or on behalf of an employer (e.g. by a recruitment agency), is intended to prevent disability or health issues being used to reject applicants at an early stage in the recruitment process. It would be unlawful, therefore, to ask applicants to list on an application form how many days' sick leave they have taken in the last year. The rule covers questions to third parties, such as a former employer, as well as to applicants.
- It is, however, permissible to make a job offer that is conditional on the applicant passing a medical examination or answering health-related questions. The employer may also ask whether an applicant will be able to carry out an intrinsic part of the job, such as handling heavy goods. In such cases, the employer is under a duty to make reasonable adjustments and this must be considered in dealing with the answer given by the applicant.
