- Denoting a person whose country of domicile is not the same as his or her country of residence for tax purposes. Before April 2008 a person resident but not domiciled in the UK paid no UK tax on foreign investment income unless this was remitted to the UK. From that date socalled non-doms who have been resident in the UK for seven of the last ten years pay a flat annual charge of $Â£ 30,000$ if they wish to avoid paying UK tax on such income and gains.
