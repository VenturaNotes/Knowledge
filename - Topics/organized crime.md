- (1) A crime that is premeditated and carefully planned, usually leaving little forensic evidence at the crime scene, perpetrated by an offender who knows right from wrong and tends to lack remorse. It is contrasted with a disorganized crime that is usually unplanned, often leaves forensic evidence at the scene, and tends to be perpetrated by an offender who is young, under the influence of alcohol or drugs, often remorseful, and sometimes mentally disordered. The distinction was first drawn in the late 1970s by the Behavioral Science Unit that was set up by the FBI in 1974 to study serial homicide and rape cases. More recent research suggested that serial offenders tend to resemble one another in the organized aspects of their behavior and differ most strikingly in the disorganized aspects. See also criminal profiling. 
- (2) Crime that is planned and carried out systematically and on a large scale; also a collective label for the people who perpetrate this kind of crime. \[From French organiser to give structure to, from Latin organizare to accompany on the organ, from organum an organ + -izare from Greek -izein to cause to become]
