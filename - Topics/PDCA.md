- Abbreviation for Plan, Do, Check, Act: a four-stage cycle widely used in feedback control. The stages are: (1) define goals and the processes required to achieve them; (2) put these into practice; (3) review the results by comparing output with objectives; (4) seek improvements by modifying the plan, the implementation, and the review process as necessary. The cycle is to be repeated indefinitely in pursuit of continuous improvement.
