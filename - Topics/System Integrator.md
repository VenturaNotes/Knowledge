- A system integrator or systems integrator (SI) is a person or company responsible for testing, scheduling, and coordinating a computer operation. An SI combines different hardware, software, and networking resources into a single computer system, serving as an IT architecture framework. Some SIs also maintain a computing operation on behalf of an enterprise. There are two types of system integrators:
	- Vertical system integration, where SIs integrate platforms and systems into a single unit.
	- Horizontal system integration, where a subsystem communicates with different systems.
