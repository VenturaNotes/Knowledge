## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (hypophysis) the master endocrine gland: a pea-sized body attached beneath the hypothalamus in a bony cavity at the base of the skull. It has an anterior lobe (adenohypophysis), which secretes thyroidstimulating hormone, ACTH (adrenocorticotrophic hormone), the gonadotrophins, growth hormone, prolactin, lipotrophin, and melanocyte-stimulating hormone. The secretion of all these hormones is regulated by specific releasing hormones, which are produced in the hypothalamus (see also CORTICOTROPHIN-RELEASING HORMONE; GONADOTROPHIN-RELEASING HORMONE; THYROTROPHIN-RELEASING HORMONE). The posterior lobe (neurohypophysis) secretes vasopressin and oxytocin, which are synthesized in the hypothalamus and transported to the pituitary, where they are stored before release.
