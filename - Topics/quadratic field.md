- Any field of the form $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{d}]$ where $d$ is a square-free integer and $d \ne 0, 1$. The elements of $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{d}]$ have the form $q_1 + q_2\sqrt{d}$, where $q_1, q_2$ are rational. $\mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{d}]$ is a degree 2 field extension over $\mathbb{Q}$. Its ring of integers consists of those elements $\zeta \in \mathbb{Q}[\sqrt{d}]$ that satisfy a quadratic equation $\zeta^2 + a\zeta + b = 0,$ where $a,b$ are integers. When $d=-19$, the ring of integers is $\mathbb{Z}[(1 + \sqrt{-19})/2]$, which is a principal ideal domain which is not a Euclidean domain.
