- A legally constituted group organized for purposes other than generating profit and in which none of the organization's income is distributed to its members, directors, or officers. Examples of non-profit organizations include churches, public schools, public charities, public clinics and hospitals, political organizations, legal aid societies, volunteer services organizations, labour unions, professional associations, research institutes, museums, and some governmental agencies. Not-for-profit organizations are essentially the same as non-profit organizations, but legal and accounting rules differ for the two in some countries. See also NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATION.
