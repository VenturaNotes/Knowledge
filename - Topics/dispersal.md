- The dissemination of offspring of plants or sessile animals. Dispersal provides organisms that are not mobile with a better chance of survival by reducing competition among offspring and parents. It also promotes the colonization of new habitats. Flowering plants produce fruits or seeds that are dispersed by such agents as wind, water, or animals. Specialized structures have evolved in many species to aid dispersal (see FRUIT).
