- A device that can input the optical image of a document page. It may be combined with internal or host resident processing of the input to manipulate the image or recognize text and output strings of character codes. Scanners can be hand-held where very small quantities are concerned and cost is more significant than accuracy; however, surprisingly good results can be achieved. Flatbed scanners and drum scanners are available where higher throughput or resolution is required
