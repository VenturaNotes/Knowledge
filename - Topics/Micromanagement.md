- Micromanagement is a term used to describe an overbearing management style in which a supervisor closely monitors and controls each detail of an indiviudal ªs workload.
- Although some leaders who use this management style may have good intentions, micromanagement often prohibits employees from developing their own leadership and management skills, or developing professional autonomy. Micromanagers often opt out of delegating work or decision-making tasks to their team members, which robs their team of an opportunity to build their skill sets or succeed on their own.
- Employees who are micromanaged often experience a decrease in morale, loss of motivation, and burnout.
