- n. 
- (1) (pons Varolii) the part of the brainstem that links the medulla oblongata and the thalamus, bulging forwards in front of the cerebellum, from which it is separated by the fourth ventricle. It contains numerous nerve tracts between the cerebral cortex and the spinal cord and several nuclei of grey matter. From its front surface the trigeminal nerves emerge. 
- (2) any portion of tissue that joins two parts of an organ.

- (pons Varolii) (pl. pontes) A part of the hindbrain that links the medulla oblongata to the midbrain. As well as relaying impulses between different parts of the brain, it contains a group of neurons that help regulate breathing movements (see ventilation CENTER). Also, certain pontine nuclei are active during REM sleep. The pons is named after its discoverer, the Italian anatomist C. Varoli (1543-75).

- $n$. A broad band of mostly white fibres connecting the two halves of the brain at the level of the brainstem above the medulla oblongata, containing the corticospinal tract and part of the reticular formation and connected to the cerebral cortex via the corticopontine tract. Not to be confused with the PONS.

- abbrev. Profile of non-verbal sensitivity, a test designed to measure ability to decode non-verbal information from the face, body, and voice. It consists of brief film clips of a woman displaying various emotional states, the respondent's task being to identify those states. It was published commercially in 1979 by the German-born US psychologist Robert Rosenthal (born 1933) and several colleagues, who reported that children's PONS scores tend to increase with age, that females tend to score higher than males, and that non-verbal behavior of strangers tends to be less accurately decoded than that of familiar people. Not to be confused with the pons.
