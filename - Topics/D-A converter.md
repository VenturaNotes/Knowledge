- (DAC), (digital-to-analogue converter) A device, usually in integrated-circuit form, that can accept a digital signal in the form of an $n$-bit parallel data word and convert it into an equivalent analogue representation. Digital output signals from, say, a microprocessor may thus be converted into a form that is suitable for driving analogue devices such as motors, meters, or other analogue actuators. The resolution of a D/A converter is a measure of the change in analogue output for a change of one least significant bit in the input. See also A/D CONVERTER.
