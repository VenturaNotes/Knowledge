- A type of chromosomal rearrangement in which the centromeres of two 'one-armed' (acrocentric) chromosomes fuse to form a single chromosome with two large arms (dicentric). In humans centric fusion involving chromosomes 13 and 14 is found in about 1 in 1000 people; as no genetic information is lost, it has no ill effects.
