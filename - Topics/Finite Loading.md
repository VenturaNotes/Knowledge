- Finite loading is a process of using various techniques to limit the number of resources consumed when running an application. These techniques include limiting bandwidth or memory usage on certain connections such as dial-up lines and restricting access to specific features like file sharing or printing capabilities. This process is often used to improve the performance of an application or system.
