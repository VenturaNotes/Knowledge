- Private property rights in ideas. This may take the form of copyright, where material such as books or music can be copied only with permission from the copyright owner, who can charge for this; or patents, where processes or product designs can only be used with permission from the patentee, who can charge a licence fee. Such property rights originally rest with authors or inventors, or their employers, but can be bought, sold, or inherited.
