- a research method in which specific cells are taken from a normal fetus, with the informed consent of the mother following her request for termination of pregnancy, for transplantation into a person suffering from a specific disease. These fetal cells would take over the function of the specific diseased or damaged cells of the host. Examples are fetal brain cells transplanted into the affected part of the brain in a patient suffering from Parkinson's disease, and fetal pancreatic cells transplanted into the pancreas of a juvenile diabetic. Other diseases are being investigated experimentally with a view to using fetal transplants. Such procedures involve major ethical considerations.
