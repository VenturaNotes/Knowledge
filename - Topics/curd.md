## Source [^1]
- The solid component produced by the coagulation of milk during the manufacture of cheese. After being pasteurized, milk is cooled down and a culture of lactic acid bacteria is added to ferment the milk sugar, lactose, to lactic acid. The resulting decrease in pH causes casein, a milk protein, to coagulate, a process known as curdling. The solid curds are then separated from the liquid component, known as whey, and inoculated with different types of microbes to produce different cheeses.
