- a fracture occurring in normal bone that has been subjected to excessive and repetitive trauma resulting in cumulative microscopic fractures. Over time, these microfractures exceed the capacity of the normal healing process, resulting in the development of a macroscopic fracture (also known as a fatigue fracture). Patients are usually long-distance runners, ballet dancers, footballers, and others who undergo regular intensive training. Pain, localized tenderness, and swelling gradually develop; initially, X-rays are normal, but a bone scan or MRI will usually allow diagnosis to be made. Treatment includes protected weight bearing, rest, cross-training, and (less commonly) surgery.
