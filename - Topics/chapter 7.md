- In the USA, the statute of the Bankruptcy Reform Act 1978 that refers to liquidation proceedings. It provides for a trustee appointed by the court to make a management charge, secure additional financing, and operate the business in order to prevent further loss. The intention of the statute, which is based on fairness and public policy, is to accept that honest debtors may not always be able to discharge their debts fully and to give them an opportunity to make a fresh start both in their business and personal lives. In an attempt to prevent opportunistic bankruptcies, the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act 2005 has made it more difficult for debtors to file under Chapter 7. Compare CHAPTER 11; CHAPTER 13.
