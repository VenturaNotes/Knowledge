- $n$. a group of lung diseases caused by inhaling dust. The dust particles must be less than $0.5 ~\mu \mathrm{m}$ in diameter to reach the depths of the lung and there is usually a long period after initial exposure before shadows appear on the chest X-ray and breathlessness develops. In practice industrial exposure to coal dust (see COAL-WORKER'S PNEUMOCONIOSIS), silica (see SILICOSIS), and asbestos (see ASBESTOSIS) produces most of the cases of pneumoconiosis. In Britain such cases are examined by the Medical Boarding Centers (Respiratory Diseases), on whose advice statutory compensation for industrial injury may be awarded.
