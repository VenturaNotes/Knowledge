## Source [^1]
- Fundamental unit of the [[nervous system]]
- Responsible for transmitting information throughout the body
## Source[^2]
- The neuron is a nerve cell and is the primary functional unit of the nervous system
## Source[^3]
- A node in a neural network.
## Source[^4]
- (neurone, nerve cell) $n$. one of the basic functional units of the nervous system: a cell specialized to transmit electrical nerve impulses and so carry information from one part of the body to another (see illustration). Each neuron has an enlarged portion, the cell body (perikaryon), containing the nucleus; from the body extend several processes (dendrites) through which impulses enter from their branches. A longer process, the nerve fibre (see AXON), extends outwards and carries impulses away from the cell body. This is normally unbranched except at the nerve ending. The point of contact of one neuron with another is known as a synapse.

## Source[^5]
- (neurone; nerve cell) An elongated branched cell that is the fundamental unit of the nervous system, being specialized for the conduction of impulses. A neuron consists of a cell body, containing the nucleus and Nissl granules; dendrites, which receive incoming impulses and pass them towards the cell body; and an axon, which conducts impulses away from the cell body, sometimes over long distances. Impulses are passed from one neuron to the next via synapses. Sensory neurons transmit information from receptors to the central nervous system. Motor neurons conduct information from the central nervous system to effectors (e.g. muscles). Interneurons form connections between neurons in the brain and ganglia, and play a key role in interpreting and analysing sensory information. (See illustration.) See also BIPOLAR NEURON; GROWTH CONE; MULTIPOLAR NEURON; NEURITE; UNIPOLAR NEURON.
