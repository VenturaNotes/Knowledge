- (CVL) The winding-up of a company by special resolution of the members when it is insolvent. A meeting of creditors must be held within 14 days of such a resolution and the creditors must be given seven days' notice of the meeting. The creditors also have certain rights to information before the meeting. A liquidator may be appointed by the members before the meeting of creditors or at the meeting by the creditors. If two different liquidators are appointed, the creditors' nominee is usually preferred. CVLs, also known as creditors' voluntary winding-ups, are the most common form of liquidation in use in the UK. Compare MEMBERS' VOLUNTARY LIQUIDATION.
