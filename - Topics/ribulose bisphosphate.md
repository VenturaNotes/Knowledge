- (RuBP) A five-carbon sugar that is combined with carbon dioxide to form two three-carbon intermediates in the first stage of the light-independent reactions of photosynthesis (see CAlvin CYCLE). The enzyme that mediates the carboxylation of ribulose bisphosphate, ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (see RubISCO), is also involved in photorespiration.
