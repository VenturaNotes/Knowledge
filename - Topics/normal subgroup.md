- If H is a subgroup of a group G, and for any element, x of G, the left and right cosets of H are equal, then H is a normal subgroup. This is denoted $H$ $\triangleright$ $G$. Equivalently, H is closed under conjugation; that is, for every x in G and $h$ in H, then $x^{-1}hx$ is in H. In an abelian group, all subgroups are normal, and in general G and {e} are normal subgroups of G. The normal subgroups are precisely those subgroups that form a well-defined quotient group.
