## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (in bioinformatics) A preliminary assembly of data subsets to form a semblance of a complete base sequence of an entire chromosome or genome. An initial goal in sequencing large genomes is generally the production of a draft sequence, which is subsequently corrected and refined to form the finished sequence. For example, the draft sequence of the human genome produced by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium in 2000 was based on sequencing of over 29,000 cloned fragments of human DNA, representing the human genome many times over. It contained numerous sequence gaps (nearly 150,000), many incorrectly assembled fragments, and averaged one error every 100 base pairs.
