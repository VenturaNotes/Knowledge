## Source [^1]
- A series of Internet standards describing the security mechanisms for IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6) and the services that they provide. IPSec was initially defined in RFC18295 through RFC1829 (1995), which were then replaced by RFC2401 and others (1998). These were in turn superseded in 2005 by RFC4301 and RFC4309, which constitute the latest version to date. An update for RFC4301 is contained in RFC6040 (2010).
