- $n$. A visual illusion caused by overlaying a simple geometric figure such as a circle or a square on a pattern of concentric circles or radiating lines, the effect being to distort the apparent shape of the figure (see illustration). It is closely related to Ehrenstein's square illusion and the Ponzo illusion. \[Named after US psychologist William Dillard Orbison (1911-52) who first drew attention to it in 1939]
