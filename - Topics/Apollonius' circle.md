- Given two points $A$ and $B$ in the plane and a positive constant $k$, the locus of all points $P$ such that $A P / P B=k$ is a circle. Such a circle is an Apollonius' circle. Taking $k=1$ gives a straight line, so either this value must be excluded or, in this context, a straight line must be considered to be a special case of a circle (see CIRCLINE). In the figure, $k=2$.
