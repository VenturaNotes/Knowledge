- The 9-box model (or 9-box grid) is a visual assessment tool that evaluates employee performance and potential. It's a grid that ranks employee performance on an x-axis and employee potential on a y-axis. The assessment tool predicts various outcomes, for example, whether a low-performing employee has high potential or a moderate performer has low potential. Stakeholders can use this tool to determine an employee's potential for career progression.
