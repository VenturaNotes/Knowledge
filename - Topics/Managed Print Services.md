- Managed print services (MPS) are companies that provide support and tools for other businesses to print, fax, and copy within their own office. The MPS aids in identifying the type of equipment that an organization needs and provides continual support and maintenance of the equipment. Unlike commercial print services, MPS do not do the printing on their end.
