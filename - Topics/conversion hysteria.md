- $n$. An obsolescent term for conversion disorder. In psychoanalysis, Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced the term in his celebrated analysis of Little Hans in an article in 1909 entitled 'Analysis of a Phobia in a Five-Year-Old Boyâ€™ (Standard Edition, X, pp. 5-149, at p. 116) to denote a form of hysteria characterized by physical symptoms (paralyses, anaesthesias, blindness, deafness, and the like) and to distinguish it from forms of hysteria characterized by anxiety and phobias without physical symptoms. See also CONVERSION, CONVERSION DISORDER, CONVERSION SYMPTOM, TRANSFERENCE NEUROSIS (1).
