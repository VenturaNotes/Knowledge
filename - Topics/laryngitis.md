- $n$. inflammation of the larynx and vocal folds, due to infection by bacteria or viruses or irritation by gases, chemicals, etc. The folds lose their vibrance (owing to swelling) and the voice becomes husky or is lost completely; breathing is harsh and difficult (see STRIDOR); and the cough is painful and honking. Obstruction of the airways may occasionally be serious, especially in children (see CROUP). The patient should rest his voice and remain in a warm moisture-laden atmosphere; steam inhalations for 15-20 minutes every 2-3 hours are traditionally beneficial.
