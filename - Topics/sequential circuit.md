- (sequential machine) A logic circuit whose outputs at a specified time are a function of the inputs at that time, and also at a finite number of preceding times. In practice, any physically realizable sequential circuit will have a finite transit time, or delay, between the inputs changing and the outputs changing (one or more of these inputs may be clock signals); the intention of the term sequential is to include not only combinational circuits but also (explicitly) memory elements such as flip-flops. Analysis and synthesis of sequential circuits is facilitated by state diagrams.
