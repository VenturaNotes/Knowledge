## Source [^1]
- Given a [[Proposition|logical statement]] A, the negation would be $\lnot A$ which is read as "not A" 
	- Example 1:
		- A = The wine bottle is full
		- $\lnot A$ = The wine bottle is not full
	- Example 2:
		- A = 2 + 2 = 5
		- $\lnot A$ = 2 + 2 $\ne$ 5

## Source[^2]
- The negation of the bits "010110" is "101001"
	- You just need to flip each bit to get negation of required string
