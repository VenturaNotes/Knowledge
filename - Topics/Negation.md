- Given a [[Proposition|logical statement]] A, the negation would be $\lnot A$ which is read as "not A" 
	- Example 1:
		- A = The wine bottle is full
		- $\lnot A$ = The wine bottle is not full
	- Example 2:
		- A = 2 + 2 = 5
		- $\lnot A$ = 2 + 2 $\ne$ 5

- The negation of the bits "010110" is "101001"
	- You just need to flip each bit to get negation of required string

- (1) In arithmetic, the operation of changing the sign of a nonzero arithmetic quantity; the negation of zero is zero. Negation is usually denoted by the minus sign. 
- (2) In logic, the application of the NOT operation on a statement, truth value, or formula.
