- Given a [[Proposition|logical statement]] A, the negation would be $\lnot A$ which is read as "not A" 
	- Example 1:
		- A = The wine bottle is full
		- $\lnot A$ = The wine bottle is not full
	- Example 2:
		- A = 2 + 2 = 5
		- $\lnot A$ = 2 + 2 $\ne$ 5

- The negation of the bits "010110" is "101001"
	- You just need to flip each bit to get negation of required string

## Source[^3]
- (1) In arithmetic, the operation of changing the sign of a nonzero arithmetic quantity; the negation of zero is zero. Negation is usually denoted by the minus sign. 
- (2) In logic, the application of the NOT operation on a statement, truth value, or formula.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. 
- (1) The contradiction, or denial, or reversal of something, or the act or process of contradicting. 
- (2) In psychoanalysis, a process whereby one continues to defend oneself against a formerly repressed wish, thought, or feeling that has come to consciousness by disavowing or disowning it, as when a patient says during therapy 'You might expect me to have felt angry with him, but I never felt any anger'. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) expounded his theory in an article entitled 'Negation' in 1925, where he asserted somewhat cryptically: 'Only one consequence of the process of negation is undone$\textemdash$the fact, namely, of the ideational content of what is repressed not reaching consciousness. The outcome of this is a kind of intellectual acceptance of the repressed, while at the same time what is essential to the repression persists' (Standard Edition, XIX, pp. 235-9, at pp. 235-6). Some psychoanalysts consider it as a defence mechanism. Also called disavowal. 
- (3) In logic, the operator that reverses the meaning of a proposition $p$, or the resulting proposition not-p that is true precisely when $p$ is false and vice versa.
