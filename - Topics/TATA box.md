- (Hogness box) A sequence of nucleotides that serves as the main recognition site for the attachment of RNA polymerase in the promoter region of eukaryotic genes. Located at around 25 nucleotides before the start of transcription, it consists of the seven-base consensus sequence TATAAAA, and is analogous to the Pribnow box in prokaryotic promoters.
