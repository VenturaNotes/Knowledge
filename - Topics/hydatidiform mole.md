- a collection of fluid-filled sacs that develop when the membrane (chorion) surrounding the embryo degenerates in early pregnancy with proliferation of the trophoblast. These sacs give the placenta the appearance of a bunch of grapes and a characteristic snowstorm appearance on ultrasound. The levels of hCG are abnormally high. Hydatidiform mole can be subdivided into complete and partial mole based on genetic and histological features. Complete moles show no evidence of fetal tissue; there is usually evidence of a fetus or fetal red blood cells with a partial mole. The widespread use of ultrasound has led to earlier diagnosis and has changed the pattern of molar pregnancy. The majority of women present with symptoms of early pregnancy failure. See GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE.
