- $n$. the perception and, as far as is possible, understanding of another's suffering, important as a motivation in all caring professions. However, overwork may destroy fellow-feeling (compassion fatigue): professionals should be aware of this possibility and make sure they are looking after themselves properly (see BURNOUT). Kindness and understanding are often undervalued as components of treatment by professionals but not by patients.
