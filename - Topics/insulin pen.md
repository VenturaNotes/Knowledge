- a user-friendly penlike device designed to inject a measured dose of insulin, typically containing 3 ml insulin ( 300 units in total) in a cartridge chamber. For each injection a new disposable needle is applied to the device. The insulin dose is then 'dialled up' and safely injected subcutaneously. The pen can be capped off and easily stored in a pocket or small bag; some types are disposable when the cartridge is empty, while others can be refilled with a new cartridge.
