- (escape velocity) For a celestial body, the minimum speed with which an object must be projected away from its surface so that the object does not return again because of gravity. The escape speed for the Earth is $\sqrt{2gR}$ where $R$ is the radius of the Earth, and is approximately 11.2 kilometers per second. Similarly, the escape speed associated with a spherical celestial body of mass M and radius R is $\sqrt{2GM/R}$ where G is the gravitational constant
