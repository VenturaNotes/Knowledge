- An approach to the construction of a consumer price index in which consumption is identified with the acquisition of consumption goods and services in a given period. For some goods acquisition and consumption are the same, but for durables the two are distinct. This is the approach commonly adopted by statistical agencies for all goods other than owner-occupied housing.
