- An order of mammals having hoofed feet with an odd number of toes$\textemdash$the 'odd-toed ungulates'. They are all herbivores and include the tapirs, rhinoceros, and horses. The teeth are large and specialized for grinding. Cellulose digestion occurs in the caecum and large intestine. Fossils of the Eocene epoch, 60 million years ago, show that these animals were at that time already distinct from the cloven-hoofed Artiodactyla (Cetartiodactyla).
