## Source [^1]
- A materials management information system (MMIS) is software with relatively narrow use. Specifically, an MMIS is used for human resource and materials management purposes. This can increase the efficiency of a business—such as a hospital or health care system—by helping it integrate its staffing and material needs. An appropriately programmed and configured MMIS interacts easily with other programs.
