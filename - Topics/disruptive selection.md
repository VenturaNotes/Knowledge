- Natural selection that favors the extremes of a phenotype in a population. It often operates when an environmental factor shows distinct variations, for example high temperatures in summer and low temperatures in winter, with no intermediate forms. In this case the population will be variously adapted to withstand both high and low temperatures. Compare Balancing Selection.
