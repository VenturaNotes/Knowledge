- $n$. vibrations or tremors in a part of the body, detected by feeling with the fingers or hand (palpation) or by listening (auscultation). The term is most commonly applied to vibrations perceived through the chest when a patient breathes, speaks (vocal fremitus), or coughs. The nature of the fremitus gives an indication as to whether the chest is affected by disease. For example, loss of vocal fremitus suggests the presence of fluid in the pleural cavity; its increase suggests consolidation of the underlying lung.
