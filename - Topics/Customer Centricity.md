- Customer centricity is a business approach that puts customers first. It focuses on customers' environments, perceptions, behaviors, and expectations. Businesses that use this approach base for most, if not all, of their decisions on improving the customer experience, developing customer loyalty, and fulfilling other customer-related objectives. An example of customer centricity is using analytics tools to view trends and patterns in customer data so an organization can learn customer behaviors and offer better products, services, and experiences.
