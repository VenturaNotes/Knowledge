- $n$. a rare malignant tumor of the bile ducts. Clinical features include abdominal pain, weight loss, pruritus, obstructive jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests. A tumour located at the junction of the right and left hepatic ducts within the liver is known as a Klatskin tumour. Primary sclerosing cholangitis, ulcerative colitis, chronic infection with specific liver flukes (such as Clonorchis sinensis), and exposure to the imaging contrast agent Thorotrast are potential risk factors for the development of cholangiocarcinoma. Differentiation from other causes of bile duct stricture(s), e.g. sclerosing cholangitis, can be very difficult.
