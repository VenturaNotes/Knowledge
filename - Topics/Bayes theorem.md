- A relationship between the conditional and the marginal probabilities of random events. Let $P[A]$ denote the marginal probability of $A$ and let $P[A \mid B]$ denote the probability of $A$ conditional on $B$. Bayes theorem states that $P[A \mid B]=P[B \mid A] \times P[A] / P[B]$, given $\mathrm{P}[\mathrm{B}]>0$.
