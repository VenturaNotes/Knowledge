- An organism considered as a source of energy for those above it in a food chain (i.e. at the next trophic level). Photosynthetic autotrophs, such as green plants and phytoplankton, which convert energy from sunlight into chemical energy, are notable examples of primary producers; herbivores are secondary producers, as they utilize energy from autotrophs and supply energy for carnivores. Compare CONSUMER.
