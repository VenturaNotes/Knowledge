## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. a catecholamine derived from dopa that functions as a neurotransmitter, acting on specific dopamine receptors and also on adrenoceptors throughout the body, especially in the limbic system and extrapyramidal system of the brain as well as the arteries and the heart. It also stimulates the release of noradrenaline from nerve endings. The effects vary with location and concentration. Dopamine is used in carefully controlled dosage to increase the strength of contraction of the heart in heart failure, shock, severe trauma, and septicaemia. Possible side-effects include unduly rapid or irregular heartbeat, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness, angina pectoris, and kidney damage.
- Certain drugs (dopamine receptor agonists) have an effect on the body similar to that of dopamine. They include apomorphine, pergolide, ropinirole, cabergoline, and pramipexole and are used to treat parkinsonism. Drugs that compete with dopamine to occupy and block the dopamine receptor sites in the body are known as dopamine receptor antagonists. They include some antipsychotic drugs (e.g. the phenothiazines and butyrophenones) and certain drugs (e.g. domperidone and metoclopramide) used to treat nausea and vomiting.
## Source[^2]
- A catecholamine that is a precursor in the synthesis of noradrenaline and adrenaline. It also functions as a neurotransmitter, especially in the brain.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A biogenic amine and catecholamine that is one of the neurotransmitter substances significantly involved in central nervous system functioning, and that also functions as a hormone. Its three main pathways within the brain are from the midbrain to the basal ganglia (see also Parkinson's disease), from the midbrain to the frontal lobes, and from the midbrain to the limbic system, the mesolimbic dopamine pathway being strongly implicated in experiences of pleasure or reward and also responses to salient stimuli in general. Formula: $\mathrm{C}_{8} \mathrm{H}_{11} \mathrm{NO}_{2}$. Also called 3-hydroxytyramine . See also DOPAminERgic, L-dopa, MESOlimbic SYSTEM, MESOTELENCEPHALIC PATHWAY, NUCLEUS ACCUMBENS, 6-HYDROXYDOPAMINE, VENTRAL TEGMENTAL AREA. DA abbrev. \[From dopa + amine]
