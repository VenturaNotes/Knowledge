- $n$. a catecholamine derived from dopa that functions as a neurotransmitter, acting on specific dopamine receptors and also on adrenoceptors throughout the body, especially in the limbic system and extrapyramidal system of the brain as well as the arteries and the heart. It also stimulates the release of noradrenaline from nerve endings. The effects vary with location and concentration. Dopamine is used in carefully controlled dosage to increase the strength of contraction of the heart in heart failure, shock, severe trauma, and septicaemia. Possible side-effects include unduly rapid or irregular heartbeat, nausea, vomiting, breathlessness, angina pectoris, and kidney damage.
- Certain drugs (dopamine receptor agonists) have an effect on the body similar to that of dopamine. They include apomorphine, pergolide, ropinirole, cabergoline, and pramipexole and are used to treat parkinsonism. Drugs that compete with dopamine to occupy and block the dopamine receptor sites in the body are known as dopamine receptor antagonists. They include some antipsychotic drugs (e.g. the phenothiazines and butyrophenones) and certain drugs (e.g. domperidone and metoclopramide) used to treat nausea and vomiting.
