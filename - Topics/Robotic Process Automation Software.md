- Robotic Process Automation (RPA) Software refers to tools that map data. Typically, these tools will take structured data and alter them. The data may also be changed so that it better fits with an array of other applications or websites. RPA software can be viewed as a process that makes data more understandable and usable to end-users or viewers of the data. These data changes occur via user interaction or via client programming.
