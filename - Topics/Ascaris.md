- $n$. a genus of parasitic nematode worms. A. lumbricoides, widely distributed throughout the world, is the largest of the human intestinal nematodes - an adult female measures up to 35 cm in length. Eggs, passed out in the stools, may be transmitted to a new host in contaminated food or drink. Larvae hatch out in the intestine and then undergo a complicated migration, via the hepatic portal vein, liver, heart, lungs, windpipe, and pharynx, before returning to the intestine where they later develop into adult worms (see also ASCARIASIS).
