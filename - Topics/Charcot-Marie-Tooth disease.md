- (peroneal muscular atrophy) a group of inherited diseases of the peripheral nerves, also known as hereditary sensorimotor neuropathy, causing a gradually progressive weakness and wasting of the muscles of the legs and the lower part of the thighs. The hands and arms are eventually affected. The genetic defect responsible for the most common form, type Ia, is a duplication on chromosome 17. The diagnosis is made by nerve conduction tests followed by genetic blood tests. \[J. M. Charcot; P. Marie (1853-1940), French physician; H. H. Tooth (1856-1925), British physician]
