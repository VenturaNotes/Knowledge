- $n$. a machine in which charged particles following a spiral path within a magnetic field are accelerated by an alternating electric field. It produces very high-energy charged particles for radiotherapy (proton therapy), which has been used in the treatment of certain cancers, particularly of the eye. Cyclotrons are used in the preparation of radioisotopes for imaging, particularly those for PET scanning (see POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY).
