- The second geological period of the Mesozoic era. It followed the Triassic, which ended about 201 million years ago, and extended until the beginning of the Cretaceous period, about 145 million years ago. It was named in 1829 by A. Brongniart after the Jura Mountains on the borders of France and Switzerland. Jurassic rocks include clays and limestones in which fossil flora and fauna are abundant. Plants included ferns, cycads, ginkgos, rushes, and conifers. Important invertebrates included ammonites (on which the Jurassic is zoned), corals, brachiopods, bivalves, and echinoids. Reptiles, notably the dinosaurs, dominated the vertebrates and the first flying reptiles$\textemdash$the pterosaurs$\textemdash$appeared. The birdlike dinosaur, Archaeopteryx, also made its appearance.
