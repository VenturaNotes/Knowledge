- The proportion of the DNA of a eukaryotic cell that consists of copies of nucleotide sequences, often in large numbers. For example, in humans these sequences can vary in length from 5 to over 300 bp, which are repeated in tandem $10^{5}$ to $10^{6}$ times. It occurs mainly around the centromeres and telomeres of the chromosomes. The highly repetitive nature of this DNA fraction gives it a distinctive base composition, and consequently when samples of DNA are centrifuged it forms so-called 'satellite bands' quite separate from the band representing the bulk of the cell's DNA. See repetitive DNA. Compare microsatellite DNA; variable number tANDEM REPEats.
