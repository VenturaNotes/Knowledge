- To press and release a button on a mouse or similar device, or (as a noun) the action of pressing and releasing a button. This will be interpreted by the current program as a request for some action to be performed. Most mice have one, two, or three buttons, so the prefixed forms left click, right click, middle click are often used. The double-click consists of two clicks of the same button in quick succession; when performed too quickly or too slowly then the user's intention is misunderstood and, typically, no action is performed. To click and drag involves holding a button down while moving the mouse; this technique is often used first to select (click) and then to move (drag) an object on the screen (see DRAG AND DROP).
