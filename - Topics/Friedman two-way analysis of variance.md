- $n$. A distribution-free statistical test of the null hypothesis that several related samples are distributed similarly. For each subject or case, the scores are ranked across samples, and the test statistic is based on these ranks. The standard equivalent distribution-dependent test is one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Also called Friedman two-way ANOVA. \[Named after the prominent US economist Milton Friedman (1912-2006) who developed it in 1937]
