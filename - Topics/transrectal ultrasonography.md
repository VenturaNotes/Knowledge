- (TRUS) an ultrasonography technique for examination of the prostate gland and seminal vesicles by placing an ultrasound probe through the anus to lie directly behind these structures in the rectum. Because of the close proximity of the probe, excellent detail is seen. The technique enables transrectal or transperineal biopsies of the prostate to be taken in a systematic manner in the diagnosis of cancer. See also VESICULOGRAPHY.
