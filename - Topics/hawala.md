- A remittance system that operates parallel to standard banking or financial channels. It was developed in India before the introduction of western banking practices. Hawala is distinguished from other remittance systems by its reliance on trust and the extensive use of family relationships and regional affiliations. Transfers of money take place based on communication between members of a network of hawaladars (hawala dealers) with minimal use of negotiable instruments.
