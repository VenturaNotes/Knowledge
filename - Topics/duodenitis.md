- $n$. inflammation of the duodenum. Duodenitis is commonly caused by infection with Helicobacter pylori, NSAIDs, smoking, and alcohol. Clinical symptoms are nonspecific (vague abdominal discomfort may be present), or the findings of duodenal inflammation may be noted at gastroscopy in an asymptomatic patient. Treatment may include antibiotics for H. pylori infection, antisecretory agents, and the withdrawal of implicated drugs (such as diclofenac).
