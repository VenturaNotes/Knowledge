## Source [^1]
- An insight engine is software designed to search, find, and analyze data. The software can index all types of data, including structured and unstructured. Structured data is data that is stored in a defined format, such as spreadsheets and databases, whereas unstructured data doesn't have a defined format, such as Word processor files and video files. When handling data, insight engines use machine learning and natural language processing for the best results.
