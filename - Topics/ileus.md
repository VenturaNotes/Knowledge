- $n$. intestinal obstruction, usually obstruction of the small intestine (ileum). Clinical symptoms include abdominal pain and distension, vomiting, and absolute constipation. Paralytic or adynamic ileus is functional obstruction of the ileum due to loss of intestinal movement (peristalsis), which may be caused by abdominal surgery (see LAPAROTOMY); spinal injuries; electrolyte abnormalities, particularly of potassium (hypokalaemia); peritonitis; or ischaemia. Treatment consists of intravenous administration of fluid and removal of excess stomach secretions by nasogastric tube until peristalsis returns (the 'drip and suck' approach). If possible, the underlying condition is treated. Mechanical ileus may be caused by gallstones entering the bowel through a fistula or widened bile duct (gallstone ileus); tumor; intussusception; intestinal volvulus; foreign bodies; thickened meconium in newborn babies (meconium ileus); or parasitic infestation, for example with the threadworm Enterobius vermicularis (verminous ileus).
