- An input device that responds to the touch of a stylus, which may be a finger, so that the stylus position on the screen may be estimated. It is thus a touchsensitive locator. The stylus could be used, say, to make selections from a number of displayed options. A typical tablet or smartphone touchscreen is based on detecting and locating changes in screen capacitance caused by the contact of one or more of a user's fingers.
