- Remote work refers to employees performing tasks, working on projects, or conducting business outside of a physical company location. These employees might work from home full-time or only a few days each week with occasional in-office work or meetings. Working anywhere in the world without reporting to a physical office is another meaning of remote work. Most remote work is not physical labor. It is also called WFH (work from home).
