- A programming language originally developed for implementation of the UNIX operating system. C is the preferred language for systems software development in the UNIX environment, and is widely used on personal computers. It combines the control and data structures of a modern high-level language with the ability to address the machine hardware at a level more usually associated with assembly language. The terse syntax is attractive to professional programmers, and the compilers generate very efficient object code. C is derived from BCPL, via a short-lived predecessor B.

- (1) The Banach space of convergent (real or complex) sequences with norm $\left\|\left(x_{n}\right)\right\|=$ $\sup \left|x_{n}\right|$. The Banach space of sequences which converge to 0 is denoted $c_{0}$. Both are closed subspaces of $l^{\infty}$.
- (2) The symbol for the cardinality of the set of real numbers
- (3) $\mathbb{C}$: The set of complex numbers. The symbol also denotes the field of complex numbers, and $\mathbb{C}^*$ denotes the multiplicative group of non-zero complex numbers
- (4) $\mathbb{C}_\infty$: The extended complex plane 
- (5) C: The roman numeral for 100, and the number 12 in hexadecimal representation
- (6) $C^0$: $C^0(X)$ denotes the vector space of real-valued continuous functions on a space X
- (7) $C^*$: $C^*(X)$ denotes the vector space of real-valued continuous, bounded functions on a space X.
- (8) $C^1$: $C^1(X)$ denotes the vector space of real-valued continuously differentiable functions on a space X
- (9) $C^\infty$: $C^\infty(X)$ denotes the vector space of real-valued functions on a space X which have continuous derivatives of all orders.
- (10) $C^\upomega$: $C^\upomega(X)$ denotes the vector space of real-valued analytic functions on a space X

- A language used to program computers. It was developed in the mid-1970s by the Bell laboratories in the USA. An extension of C, called C++, is widely used.
