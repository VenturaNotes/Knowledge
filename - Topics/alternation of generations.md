- The occurrence within the life cycle of an organism of two or more distinct forms (generations), which differ from each other in appearance, habit, and method of reproduction. The phenomenon occurs in some protists and simple multicellular organisms, certain lower animals (e.g. cnidarians and parasitic flatworms), and in plants. The malaria parasite (Plasmodium), for example, has a complex life cycle involving the alternation of sexually and asexually reproducing generations. In plants the generation with sexual reproduction is called the gametophyte and the asexual generation is the sporophyte, either of which may dominate the life cycle, and there is also alternation of the haploid and diploid states. Thus in vascular plants the dominant plant is the diploid sporophyte; it produces spores that germinate into small haploid gametophytes. In mosses the gametophyte is the dominant plant and the sporophyte is the spore-bearing capsule. See INTERPOLATION HYPOTHESIS; TRANSFORMATION HYPOTHESIS.
