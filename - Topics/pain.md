- $n$. an unpleasant sensation ranging from mild discomfort to agonized distress, associated with real or potential tissue damage. Pain is a response to impulses from the peripheral nerves in damaged tissue, which pass to nerves in the spinal cord, where they are subjected to a gate control. This gate modifies the subsequent passage of the impulses in accordance with descending controls from the brain. Because attention is a crucial component of pain, distraction can act as a basis for pain therapy. On the other hand, anxiety and depression focus the attention and exaggerate the pain. If the nerve pathways are damaged, the brain can increase the amplification in the pathway, maintaining the sensation as a protective mechanism.

- Severe physical or mental discomfort or distress. Pain of a physical origin arises through detection of noxious stimuli or tissue injury by specific sensory neurons in the affected part of the body, which relay signals to the thalamus in the brain (see nOCICEPTION). However, perception of and susceptibility to pain are determined by higher centers in the cortex and can be influenced by such factors as emotional state.
