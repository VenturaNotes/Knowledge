- Clinical context object workgroup (CCOW) refers to a type of internet protocol. These protocols allow for computer programs to operate in synchronicity, meaning that a user who is logged in on one computer can then use other machines. Users are able to gain access to any linked workspaces. CCOW allows programs to be "context-aware," meaning that they are operating in synchronicity with each other. They are commonly used in medical and healthcare settings. For example, a medical professional who logs into a CCOW machine can then use other machines in the computer network.
