- n. 
- (1) the surgical removal of a part of the body. Extraction of teeth is usually achieved by applying elevators and extraction forceps to the crown or root of the tooth to dislocate it from its socket. When this is not possible, for example because the tooth or root is deeply buried within the bone, extraction is performed surgically by removing bone and, where necessary, dividing the tooth. 
- (2) the act of pulling out a baby from the body of its mother during childbirth.
