- An international agreement signed in 1997, designed to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases in the interests of controlling global warming. Some critics have denounced the protocol as quite inadequate for its declared purpose. It has been ratified by the European Union, but not by the US, which considers the reductions proposed to be impracticable. In 2011 the parties to the Protocol agreed to finalize a more stringent successor treaty by 2015; however, in 2012 the Protocol was extended to 2020 .
