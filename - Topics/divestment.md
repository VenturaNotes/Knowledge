- The disposal of part of its activities by a firm. This sometimes reflects the commercial judgement that the activity concerned would be more profitable operating independently or run by another firm. In other cases, divestment is required by anti-monopoly regulators to reduce a firm's monopoly power.

- A business strategy in which a part of a business is sold off. It may be motivated either by a firm's decision to focus on certain aspects of its operation by selling those parts that no longer fit, or by the need to reduce costs and improve the profitability of the business by selling unprofitable parts. Competitors may seek to increase their market position by buying a divested business, or other companies may purchase a divested business as part of a diversification strategy.
