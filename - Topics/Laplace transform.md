- An integral transformation $\mathscr{L}$ of a function $f(x)$ into another function $\mathscr{L}f$ or $\overline f$ of a different variable $p$. The Laplace transform $\overline{f}(p)$ of $f(x)$ is defined as $$\overline{f}(p) = \int_0^{\infty}f(x)e^{-px}dx.$$The transform is useful in solving differential equations, as it handles derivatives well; for example, the transform of $f'(x)$ equals $p\overline f(p) - f(0)$. At its simplest, a differential equation in $f(x)$ is transformed into an algebraic equation involving $\overline {f}(p)$ which is solved to find $\overline {f}(p)$; by recognizing $\overline{f}(p)$ as the transform of a function, or by applying an inverse transform theorem, the solution $f(x)$ can then be found. For a list of Laplace transforms, see APPENDIX 10. See also FOURIER TRANSFORM
