## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Refers to the inconsistency in the time it takes for data packets to travel across a network
- Essentially the variation in delay between packets arriving at their destination, which can lead to issues like choppy audio or video in real-time applications like video calls or online gaming when the delay is significant
- Measured in milliseconds and often caused by [[network congestion]] or unstable network conditions
## Source[^2]
- Jitter is the variation in time delay between when a signal is transmitted and when it's received over a network connection, measuring the variability in [[ping]]
- Delay caused by
	- [[Network congestion]]
	- Poor hardware performance
	- Not implementing [[packet prioritization]]
