## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Refers to the inconsistency in the time it takes for data packets to travel across a network
- Essentially the variation in delay between packets arriving at their destination, which can lead to issues like choppy audio or video in real-time applications like video calls or online gaming when the delay is significant
- Measured in milliseconds and often caused by [[network congestion]] or unstable network conditions
## Source[^2]
- Jitter is the variation in time delay between when a signal is transmitted and when it's received over a network connection, measuring the variability in [[ping]]
- Delay caused by
	- [[Network congestion]]
	- Poor hardware performance
	- Not implementing [[packet prioritization]]

## Source[^3]
- The variations in the arrival time of a supposedly synchronous signal. Jitter may be caused by the fact that the original source of the signals has variations from its ideal periodic time, or by variations in the transit time from the signal source to the point at which the arrival times are actually observed, caused either by variations in the path length or in the speed at which the signal travels. In practice it is likely that all three effects contribute, and jitter is nearly always present.
