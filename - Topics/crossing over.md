## Source [^1]
- A process that happens during cell division when chromosomes exchange genetic material
## Source[^2]
- A cellular process that happens during [[meiosis]] when chromosomes of the same type are lined up
## Source[^3]
- Exchanging of chromosomes between [[Homologous chromosome|homologous chromosomes]] that results in genetic variation
## Source[^4]
- (in genetics) the exchange of sections of chromatids that occurs between pairs of homologous chromosomes, which results in the recombination of genetic material. It occurs during meiosis at a chiasma.
## Source[^5]
- An exchange of portions of chromatids between homologous chromosomes. As the chromosomes begin to move apart at the end of the first prophase of meiosis, they remain in contact at a number of points (see chiasma). At these points the chromatids break and rejoin in such a way that sections are exchanged (see illustration). Crossing over thus alters the pattern of genes in the chromosomes. See recombination.

## Source[^6]
- $n$. The interchange or swapping of homologous sections of paired chromosomes during meiosis (1), producing variability in the hereditary characteristics of the offspring. Also called crossover or breakage and reunion . See also DNA RECOMBination, Linkage.
