- A timing device used to guard against errors caused by the lack of an expected response to a processor action within some maximum permitted time. One example would be if no acknowledgment is received to the transmission of a message from one processor to another. After some time interval it would be assumed that the transmission had failed and should be repeated. See also TIMEOUT.
