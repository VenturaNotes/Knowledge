- In communication theory, the use of a code to improve the efficiency of a communication system in which noise is absent or negligible. Noiseless coding is thus generally the same as source coding. Note that the process of coding is itself usually noiseless: there is no need for encoders or decoders to introduce noise, so the term noiseless coding is not used to imply the absence of such noise.
