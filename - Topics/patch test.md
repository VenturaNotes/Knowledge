- a specialist test to discover which allergen is responsible for contact dermatitis in a patient. Very low (validated) concentrations of potentially relevant allergens are applied under patches on the back. These are removed after two days and the underlying skin is examined then, and again after a further two days. International criteria exist for interpreting results. A positive test will show an eczematous reaction, although differentiating allergic from irritant reactions is sometimes difficult. The commonest allergens are nickel (e.g. from costume jewellery), fragrances (from toiletries), preservatives, and hair dye chemicals. Establishing the relevance of the reactions is critical.
