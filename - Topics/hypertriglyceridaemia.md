- hypertriglyceridaemia $n$. an excess of triglyceride lipids in the serum, which can be caused by a genetic predisposition with or without a high-fat diet (see also LIPOPROTEIN LIPASE), excessive alcohol intake, or poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. The condition can predispose to cardiovascular disease and, in its extreme form, to acute pancreatitis. Lipid-lowering drugs, including fibrates, are used in treatment.
