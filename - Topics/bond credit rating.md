- A graded assessment of the creditworthiness of a bond issue, which measures the perceived likelihood of the issuer, such as a company or government, defaulting on its debt. The higher the credit rating, the lower the risk associated with the bond and the lower the return on the investment. Ratings, which are issued by private credit rating agencies such as Moody's or Standard and Poor's, range from AAA (the most secure) to C or D. On this basis bonds can be divided into those that are 'investment-grade'$\textemdash$relatively safe$\textemdash$and those that are more or less speculative ('junk' bonds).
