- (intrinsic rate of increase) Symbol $r$. The number of offspring of an individual organism that would survive to reproductive age under ideal conditons. It is a measure of an individual's reproductive potential, although this is seldom fully realized under natural conditons. Organisms with a high biotic potential undergo $r$ selection. Compare REPRODUCTION RATE.
