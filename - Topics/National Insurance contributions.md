- (NICs) Payments made by those with earned income that contribute to the National Insurance Fund, from which benefits are paid. These benefits include retirement pensions, unemployment pay, widow's benefits, invalidity benefit, and certain sickness and maternity benefits. There are six different classes of National Insurance contributions; the class applicable to a person depends on the type of earned income received by that person.
- Class 1 is paid by those with earnings from employment. There are two parts to class 1 , primary contributions paid by the employee and secondary contributions paid by the employer. The rates of contributions depend on the level of earnings and also whether or not the employee is a member of a contracted-out occupational, personal, or stakeholder pension scheme; for employees the standard rate is $12 \%$ on weekly earnings between $£ 155$ and $£ 827$ and $2 \%$ on weekly earnings thereafter (2016-17 figures). Employers also pay Class 1 contributions at a standard rate of $13.8 \%$; there is currently (2016-17) an allowance of $£ 3,000$.
- Class 2 was a flat-rate contribution paid by the self-employed; it was abolished from April 2016.
- Class 3 is voluntary, and is paid at a flat rate $-£ 14.10$ per week for 2016-17. It is paid by those wishing to maintain their contribution record even though they may be unemployed or their level of earnings is below that for mandatory contributions.
- Class 4 is paid by the self-employed at a rate of $9 \%$ on income between a lower limit of $£ 8,060$ per year and an upper limit of $£ 43,500$ per year and $2 \%$ on yearly income thereafter.
- Class 1A was introduced in 1991 and is payable by employers who provide their employees with benefits in kind (typically cars for private as well as business use). The current rate is $13.8 \%$ of the cash equivalent figure.
- Class 1B is payable by employers in value of any items included in a PAYE settlement with HM Revenue and Customs.

- (NICs) Charges levied in the UK on employees, employers, and the self-employed to help pay for social security. These contributions are levied as fixed percentages of wages, with exemptions for very low incomes. NICs form part of the tax wedge between the cost of labour to employers and the cash benefit of working to their employees.
