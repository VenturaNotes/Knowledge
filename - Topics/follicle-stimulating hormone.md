## Source [^1]
- (FSH) a hormone (see GONADOTROPHIN) synthesized and released by the anterior pituitary gland. FSH stimulates ripening of the follicles in the ovary and formation of sperm in the testes. It is administered by injection to treat sterility due to lack of ovulation, amenorrhoea, and decreased sperm production. Stimulation of ovulation by FSH may, in some cases, lead to multiple pregnancy.
## Source[^2]
- (FSH; follitropin) A hormone, secreted by the anterior pituitary gland in mammals, that stimulates, in female mammals, ripening of specialized structures in the ovary (Graafian follicles) that produce ova and, in males, the formation of sperm in the testis. It is a major constituent of fertility drugs, used to treat failure of ovulation and decreased sperm production. See also GONADOTROPHIN.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A gonadotrophic hormone that is secreted by the anterior pituitary and that stimulates the growth of Graafian follicles in females and production of spermatozoa in males. See also oestrous CYCLE. Compare LUTEINIZING HORMONE. FSH abbrev.
