- $n$. the hard extremely dense connective tissue that forms the skeleton of the body. It is composed of a matrix of collagen fibres impregnated with bone salts (chiefly calcium carbonate and calcium phosphate; see HYDROXYAPATITE), in which are embedded bone cells (see OSTEOCYTE). Compact (or cortical) bone forms the outer shell of bones; it consists of a hard virtually solid mass made up of bony tissue arranged in concentric layers (Haversian systems). Spongy (or cancellous) bone, found beneath compact bone, consists of a meshwork of bony bars (trabeculae) with many interconnecting spaces containing marrow. (See illustration overleaf.)

- Individual bones may be classed as long, short, flat, or irregular. The outer layer of a bone is called the periosteum. The medullary cavity is lined with endosteum and contains the marrow. Bones not only form the skeleton but also act as stores for mineral salts and play an important part in the formation of blood cells.

- The hard connective tissue of which the skeleton of most vertebrates is formed. It comprises a matrix of collagen fibers ($30 \%$) impregnated with bone salts ($70 \%$), mostly calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite, $\mathrm{Ca}_{10}\left(\mathrm{PO}_{4}\right)_{6}(\mathrm{OH})_{2}$), in which are embedded bone cells: osteoblasts (which secrete the matrix) and osteocytes. Bone generally replaces embryonic cartilage and is of two sorts$\textemdash$compact bone and spongy bone. The outer compact bone is formed as concentric layers (lamellae) that surround small holes (Haversian canals): see illustration. The inner spongy bone is chemically similar but forms a network of bony bars. The spaces between the bars may contain bone marrow or (in birds) air for lightness. Bone is resorbed by cells called osteoclasts, which work in dynamic interaction with the bone-forming osteoblasts to remodel bone during growth or repair, e.g. following injury or in response to changes in loads. See also BONE MORPHOGENETIC PROTEIN; CARTILAGE BONE; MEMBRANE BONE; PERIOSTEUM.
