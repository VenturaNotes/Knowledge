## Synthesis

- A material, such as silicon or germanium, whose electrical conductivity increases with temperature and is intermediate between metals and insulators. In pure semiconductors this effect is due to the thermal generation of equal numbers of negative charge carriers (electrons) and positive charge carriers (holes). These materials are called intrinsic or i-type semiconductors.
- The introduction of specific types of impurity atoms into a pure semiconductor can significantly increase its conductivity: donor impurities, which belong to group 5 of the periodic table, greatly increase the number of conduction electrons and produce an n-type semiconductor; acceptor impurities, which belong to group 3, greatly increase the number of holes and produce a p-type semiconductor. These materials are called extrinsic semiconductors. The conductivity of an extrinsic semiconductor depends on the type and the amount (or doping level) of impurity present
- Semiconductors of different conductivity$\textemdash$n-type, p-type, highly doped n- and p-type, i-type$\textemdash$can be brought together to form a variety of junctions, which are the basis of semiconductor devices used as electronic components. The term semiconductor is frequently applied to the devices themselves.
