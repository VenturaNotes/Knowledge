- The acquisition or takeover of a company whose shares are valued below their asset value, and the subsequent sale of the company's assets. Having identified a suitable company, an entrepreneur or investment company acquires a controlling interest in it by buying its shares; after revaluation, properties or other assets held can be sold for cash, which is distributed to shareholders (now including the entrepreneur).
- Subsequently, the entrepreneur can either revitalize the management of the company and later sell off the acquired shareholding at a profit or, in some cases, close the business down. Because the asset stripper is heedless of the welfare of the other shareholders, the employees, the suppliers, or creditors of the stripped company, the practice is generally deprecated.
