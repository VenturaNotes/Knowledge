- Terms of trade in which a supplier will post goods to a customer, provided the customer pays the postman or delivery man the full invoice amount when they are delivered. It was extensively used in mail order (see MAIL-ORDER HOUSE), but the use of telephone and Internet ordering using credit cards has reduced the amount of COD business.
