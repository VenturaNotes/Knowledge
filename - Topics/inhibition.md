- (1) (in physiology) the prevention or reduction of the functioning of an organ, muscle, etc., by the action of certain nerve impulses. 
- (2) (in psychoanalysis) an inner command that prevents one from doing something forbidden. Some inhibitions are essential for social adjustment, but excessive inhibitions can severely restrict one's life.

- (1) (in biochemistry) (enzyme inhibition) A reduction in the rate of an enzyme-catalysed reaction by substances called inhibitors. Competitive inhibition occurs when the inhibitor molecules resemble the substrate molecules and bind to the active site of the enzyme, so preventing normal enzymatic activity. Competitive inhibition can be reversed by increasing the concentration of the substrate. In noncompetitive inhibition the inhibitor binds to a part of the enzyme or enzyme-substrate complex other than the active site, known as an allosteric site. This deforms the active site so that the enzyme cannot catalyze the reaction. Noncompetitive inhibition cannot be reversed by increasing the concentration of the substrate. The toxic effects of many substances are produced in this way. Inhibition by reaction products (feedback inhibition) is important in the control of enzyme activity. See also allosteric enzyme. 
- (2) (in physiology) The prevention or reduction of the activity of neurons or effectors (such as muscles) by means of certain nerve impulses. Inhibitory activity often provides a balance to stimulation of a process; for example, the impulse to stimulate contraction of a skeletal muscle may be accompanied by an inhibitory impulse to prevent contraction of its antagonist.

- $n$. 
- (1) The act or process of restraining or preventing something, or the state of being restrained or prevented. 
- (2) A stopping or checking of a physiological process, as when the action of a neuron, organ, or gland is interrupted by the action of a nerve impulse or a hormone. See also inhibitory postsynaptic potential. Compare excitation. 
- (3) The weakening of a conditioned response by extinction (2) or an unconditioned response by habituation (2) or by the occurrence of a distracting stimulus. See also reciprocal inhibition. Compare excitation. 
- (4) A psychological state or condition characterized by lack of confidence and restriction of the range of expressive behavior. See also avoidant personality disorder, REACTIVE ATTACHMENT DISORDER. 
- (5) In psychoanalysis, the unconscious restraint of a drive or impulse. See also AIM-INHIBITION. inhibit vb. \[From Latin inhibere, inhibitum to restrain, from habere to have + -ion indicating an action, process, or state]
