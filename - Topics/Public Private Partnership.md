- (PPP) An arrangement for collaboration between the public and private sectors for the provision of policies, services, and infrastructure. The contribution of the public sector in a PPP is typically in the form of grants, subsidies, or tax breaks, and sometimes in the form of existing assets or provision of services. The private partner company makes an investment in infrastructure (called a Private Finance Initiative) or provides a public service, and assumes the risk in the project.
