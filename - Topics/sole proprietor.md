- A person running a business without partners or incorporation. The advantage of sole proprietorship is unity of control, as the owner and management are the same. The drawback of sole proprietorship is that in many industries economies of scale are such that the minimum efficient scale of a business is well beyond the capacity of a single individual to provide sufficient capital and manage the functioning of the business.
