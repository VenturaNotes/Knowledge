- $n$. The white crystalline alkaloid central nervous system stimulant that is present in coffee, tea, cocoa, cola, chocolate, and many analgesic and tonic medicines and that dilates blood vessels and prevents adenosine from inhibiting glutamate release. It is the most common and the most potent of the three pharmacologically active xanthine derivatives, the others being theobromine and theophylline. Its major psychological effects when taken in moderate dosages include a decrease in fatigue and drowsiness, an increase in speed and efficiency, and a reduction in the number of errors (especially in an overlearned task such as typing); large dosages cause insomnia, tachycardia, diuresis, tremor, and possibly cardiovascular and respiratory failure, and there is evidence of caffeine dependence (2), abrupt discontinuation after repeated and regular moderate or high dosages tending to lead to headaches, drowsiness, depression, and sometimes nausea and vomiting.

Addiction to caffeine, or habitual excessive caffeine ingestion. decaffeinated adj. With all or most of the caffeine removed. Also spelt caffein .
