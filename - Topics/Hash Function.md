## Source [^1]
- Takes an input (message) and produces a fixed-length hash value (digest)

## Source[^2]
- Any algorithm that maps data of variable length to a hash value which serves as a safeguard against accidental corruption and provides a means for efficient searching of the data. Checksums are a very simple example, but more sophisticated hash functions may be one-way functions and so provide some information security
