- (flavin adenine dinucleotide) a coenzyme, derived from riboflavin, that takes part in many important oxidation-reduction reactions. It consists of two phosphate groups, adenine, and ribose.
## Source[^3]
- (flavin adenine dinucleotide) A coenzyme important in various biochemical reactions. It comprises a phosphorylated vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{2}$ (riboflavin) molecule linked to the nucleotide adenine monophosphate (AMP). FAD is usually tightly bound to the enzyme forming a flavoprotein. It functions as a hydrogen acceptor in dehydrogenation reactions, being reduced to $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$. This in turn is oxidized to FAD by the electron transport chain, thereby contributing to the generation of ATP (1.5 molecules of ATP per molecule of $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$ ).
