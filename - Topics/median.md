- A typical value that is identified by arranging a set of numbers in an ascending or descending scale and selecting the middle number (if there is an odd number in the set) or the arithmetic mean of the middle two numbers (if there is an even number). This can give a more representative average in some circumstances than an arithmetic mean or a geometric mean.
