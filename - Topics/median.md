- A typical value that is identified by arranging a set of numbers in an ascending or descending scale and selecting the middle number (if there is an odd number in the set) or the arithmetic mean of the middle two numbers (if there is an even number). This can give a more representative average in some circumstances than an arithmetic mean or a geometric mean.
## Source[^2]
- The median of the distribution of a random variable $X$ is the value $m$ such that $P[X \leq m] \geq 1 / 2$ and $P[X \geq m] \geq 1 / 2$. A median of a sample is an order statistic that gives the 'middle' value of the data, that is, the value such that there is an equal number of observations below and above it, if the sample size is odd, or the average of the two such central values, if the sample size is even. As a measure of central tendency of the data it is sometimes preferred to the mean, since it is not affected by outliers.

- (1) (in anatomy) situated in or denoting the median plane, which divides the body into right and left halves. See ANATOMICAL POSITION.

- The middle number or value in a series of numbers or values.

- $n$. In descriptive statistics, a measure of central tendency that is the middle value of the set of scores arranged in order of magnitude, or the mean of the two middle scores if there is an even number of scores and therefore no single middle score. Compare MEAN, MODE. median adj. \[From Latin medius middle]
