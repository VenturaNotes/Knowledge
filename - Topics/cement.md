Glass ionomer cements are used for filling, whereas zinc phosphate, zinc polycarboxylate, and glass ionomer cements are used for luting. Zinc oxide-eugenol cements are widely used as temporary fillings or as an impression material. Advances in bonding have resulted in the development of universal resin cements that may be chemical curing or light-cured.
