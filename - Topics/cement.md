- $n$. 
- (1) any of a group of materials used in dentistry either as fillings or as lutes for crowns. Glass ionomer cements are used for filling, whereas zinc phosphate, zinc polycarboxylate, and glass ionomer cements are used for luting. Zinc oxide-eugenol cements are widely used as temporary fillings or as an impression material. Advances in bonding have resulted in the development of universal resin cements that may be chemical curing or light-cured. 
- (2) (bone cement) a fast-setting material used to fix prostheses (e.g. artificial hips) in place and immobilize fractures. 
- (3) see CEMENTUM.
## Source[^2]
- (cementum) A thin layer of bony material that fixes teeth to the jaw. It covers the dentine of the root of a tooth, below the level of the gum, and is attached to the periodontal membrane lining the tooth socket in the jawbone.
## Source[^3]
- Any of various substances used for bonding or setting to a hard material. Portland cement is a mixture of calcium silicates and aluminates made by heating limestone ($CaCO_3$) with clay (containing aluminosilicates) in a kiln. The product is ground to a fine powder. When mixed with water it sets in a few hours and then hardens over a longer period of time due to the formation of hydrated aluminates and silicates.
