- $n$. An attribute that is inherent in a phenomenon, without which the phenomenon cannot occur or exist. For example, amplitude is an integral attribute of any sound, because without amplitude there can be no sound wave and therefore no sound, but frequency (1) is not an integral attribute of sound, because noise (1) is sound without any definite frequency. In the visual modality, lightness is an integral attribute of color, but saturation (1) is not. Compare SEPARAble ATTRIBUTE.
