- $n$. the main female reproductive organ, which produces ova (egg cells) and steroid hormones in a regular cycle (see MENSTRUAL CYCLE) in response to hormones (gonadotrophins) from the anterior pituitary gland. There are two ovaries, situated in the lower abdomen, one on each side of the uterus (see REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM). Each ovary contains numerous follicles, within which the ova develop (see illustration), but only a small proportion of them reach maturity (see Graafian follicle; oogenesis). The follicles secrete oestrogen and small amounts of androgen. After ovulation a corpus luteum forms at the site of the ruptured follicle and secretes progesterone. Oestrogen and progesterone regulate the changes in the uterus throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. $\textemdash$ovarian adj.

## Source[^2]
- (1) The reproductive organ in female animals in which eggs (ova) are produced. In most vertebrates there are two ovaries (in some fish the ovaries fuse together to form a single structure and in birds the left ovary only is functional). As well as eggs, they produce steroid hormones (see oestrogen; Progesterone). In mammals each ovary is situated close to the opening of a fallopian tube; it contains numerous follicles in which the eggs develop and from which they are released in a regular cycle. See also GRAAFIAN FOLLICLE; MENSTRUAL CYCLE; OOGENESIS; OVARIAN CYCLE; OVULATION; REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM. 
- (2) The hollow base of the carpel of a flower, containing one or more ovules. After fertilization, the ovary wall develops into the fruit enclosing the seeds. In some species, the carpels are fused together to form a complex ovary.
