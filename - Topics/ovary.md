- $n$. the main female reproductive organ, which produces ova (egg cells) and steroid hormones in a regular cycle (see MENSTRUAL CYCLE) in response to hormones (gonadotrophins) from the anterior pituitary gland. There are two ovaries, situated in the lower abdomen, one on each side of the uterus (see REPRODUCTIVE SYSTEM). Each ovary contains numerous follicles, within which the ova develop (see illustration), but only a small proportion of them reach maturity (see Graafian follicle; oogenesis). The follicles secrete oestrogen and small amounts of androgen. After ovulation a corpus luteum forms at the site of the ruptured follicle and secretes progesterone. Oestrogen and progesterone regulate the changes in the uterus throughout the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. $\textemdash$ovarian adj.
