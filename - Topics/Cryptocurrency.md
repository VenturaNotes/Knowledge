- Cryptocurrency is any digital currency that uses cryptography to secure transactions and verify the exchange of currency ownership. Cryptocurrencies are decentralized networks based on immutable blockchain technology, making them immune to government interference or manipulation.
- The first cryptocurrency brought into existence was Bitcoin, which was founded in 2009. Cryptocurrency units are created through a process called mining, where computer nodes solve complicated mathematical equations that generate coins. However, most cryptocurrency users receive their cryptocurrency by exchanging or purchasing it from other users.
