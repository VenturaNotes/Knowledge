## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A distance-vector routing protocol developed by [[Cisco]] that uses a classful network addressing scheme to calculate routing metrics.
	- This means it considers the network class (A, B, C) when determining the best path to a destination
	- It is considered outdated due to its limitations and is largely replaced by more advanced, [[classless protocols]] like [[Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol|EIGRP]]
### Key Points
- Operates based on the traditional classful network addressing system, which is no longer widely used 
- Calculates routes by exchanging information with neighboring [[routers]]
