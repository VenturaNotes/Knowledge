- $n$. one of the two types of light-sensitive cells in the retina of the eye (compare ROD). The human retina contains 6-7 million cones; they function best in bright light and are essential for acute vision (receiving a sharp accurate image). The area of the retina called the fovea contains the greatest concentration of cones. Cones can also distinguish colors. It is thought that there are three types of cone, each sensitive to the wavelength of a different primary color - red, green, or blue. Other colours are seen as combinations of these three primary colors.
