- The affine subspaces of 3-dimensional Euclidean space are the points, lines, planes, and whole space. The translations of these subspaces are all vector spaces. Formally an affine space is a map $S \times X \to S$ where $S$ is a set and $X$ is a vector space $X$, and where we write $s + x$ for the image of $(s, x)$, satisfying
	- (i) $s + 0 = s,$
	- (ii) $(s + x) + y = s + (x + y).$
	- (iii) given $s, t \in S$, there is a unique $x \in X$ such that $s + x = t$ 
- The solutions of an inhomogeneous linear equation form an affine space. For example, the solutions to the ODE $y''-y = 1$ has a solution set S and the vector space X is the solution space of $y''-y = 0$. Any vector space $V$ is an affine space with $S = X = V$
