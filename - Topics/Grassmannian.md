- The Grassmannian G(k, n), named after Hermann Grassmann (1809 - 77), is a smooth manifold parameterizing all the k-dimensional subspaces of $\mathbb{R}^n$. When k=1, this is (n-1)-dimensional real projective space. When k = 2, a subspace can be determined by a basis $v_1,v_2.$ Unfortunately, there are many different bases for the same subspace. However, if $\land$ denotes the exterior product, then $$(av_1 +bv_2) \land (cv_1 + dv_2) = (ad-bc)v_1 \land v_2,$$and so any two bases give the same product in $\land^2\mathbb{R}^n$ up to a scalar multiple. This means that G(2, n) can be considered as a submanifold of the projective space $\mathbb{P}(\land^2\mathbb{R}^2)$ and more generally $G(k,n) \subseteq \mathbb{P}(\land^k\mathbb{R}^n)$. The dimension of G(k, n) equals k(n-k).
