	- #question What is meant by cross-functional team? Give an example
	- #question Are the tasks or user stories always from a backlog?
	- #question What is a user story?
	- Sprint Planning: The team selects items from the product backlog to work on during the sprint and plans how to accomplish them.
	- Daily Scrum (Stand-up): A short daily meeting where team members synchronize their activities and plan for the next 24 hours.
		- #question What is a scrum?
	- Development and Testing: The team designs, codes, tests, and integrates the selected features.
