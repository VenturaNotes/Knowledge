## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. an iron-containing compound (a porphyrin) that combines with the protein globin to form haemoglobin, found in the red blood cells.
## Source[^2]
- (heme) An iron-containing molecule (see formula) that binds with proteins as a cofactor or prosthetic group to form the haemoproteins. These are haemoglobin, myoglobin, and the cytochromes. Essentially, haem comprises a porphyrin with its four nitrogen atoms holding the iron(II) atom as a chelate. This iron can reversibly bind oxygen (as in haemoglobin and myoglobin) or (as in the cytochromes) conduct electrons by conversion between the iron(II) and iron(III) series.
