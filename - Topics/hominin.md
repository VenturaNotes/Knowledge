- Any member of the clade or tribe (Hominini) that contains modern humans and their recent ancestors in the genus Homo plus other closely related extinct bipedal hominids, including members of the genera Australopithecus, the ardipithecines, and Paranthropus. Fossil evidence shows that the early hominins diverged from chimpanzees about 7-6 million years ago (mya) in Africa, and evolved the ability to walk upright on two legs. However, some make the contentious claim that the earliest hominin was Graecopithecus, which lived in eastern Europe around 7.20 mya. This is based on recent analysis of a fossil tooth and jawbone.
