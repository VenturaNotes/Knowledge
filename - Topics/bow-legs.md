- pl. n. abnormal out-curving of the legs, resulting in a gap between the knees on standing. A certain degree of bowing is normal in small children, but persistence into adult life, or later development of this deformity, results from abnormal growth of the epiphysis or arthritis. The condition can be corrected by osteotomy. Medical name: genu varum.
