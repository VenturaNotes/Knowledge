- Samuelson rule An equation describing the set of Pareto-efficient allocations in an economy with public goods. In an economy with one public good, one private good, and $H$ consumers, the Samuelson rule requires that$$\sum_{h=1}^{H} M R S_{G, x}^{h}=M R T_{G, x}$$where $M R S^{h}{ }_{G, x}$ is the marginal rate of substitution for consumer $h$ between the public good, $G$, and the private good, $x$, and $M R T_{G, x}$ is the marginal rate of transformation between $G$ and $x$. The marginal rate of substitution should be interpreted as a measure of marginal benefit, and the marginal rate of transformation as a measure of marginal cost. The marginal benefits are summed since an additional unit of the public good benefits all consumers.
