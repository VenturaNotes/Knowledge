- A specified sum paid regularly to a person who has reached a certain age or retired from employment. It is normally paid from the date of reaching the specified age or the retirement date until death.
- In the UK, contributory retirement pensions are usually paid by the state from the normal retirement age (until 201065 for men and 60 for women, now gradually adjusting to 65 for both in 2018 and 67 for both in 2028) irrespective of whether or not the pensioners have retired from full-time employment. A widow who was bereaved before 9 April 2001 may also receive a state pension based on her husband's contributions.
- From 1978 state pensions were augmented by the State Earnings-Related Pension Scheme (SERPS); this was subsequently replaced by a non-earnings-related scheme, the State Second Pension (SSP). From April 2016 new pensioners receive the New State Pension, a single payment to replace both the basic state pension and the SSP.
- The private sector of the insurance industry also provides a wide variety of occupational pension schemes, personal pension schemes, and stakeholder pension schemes, as well as annuities and endowment assurances. Financial analysts predict a major pensions crisis in the mid-21st century, since demographic trends will produce an ever-growing number of people beyond retirement age drawing on insufficient state and personal provision.

- A regular income paid by the state to people above pensionable age, by former employers to people who have retired from employment, or by a personal pension fund to a contributor. State pensions may be conditional on having made contributions to an insurance fund during one's working life. Occupational pensions may be contributory or noncontributory. Pension schemes normally give members pensions for their own lives; they vary in their provision for surviving spouses and other dependants. Personal pensions can also be purchased from insurance companies. See also OCCUPATIONAL PENSION; PAY-AS-YOU-GO PENSION; PORTABLE PENSION.
