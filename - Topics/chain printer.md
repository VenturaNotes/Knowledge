- An obsolete type of solid-font line printer in which the font was etched or engraved on small plates linked together to form a chain. The chain carrying the type font moved continuously at high speed relative to the paper, and the characters were printed by briefly impacting the paper and an inked ribbon against the moving type font. The chain printer was superseded by the train printer.
