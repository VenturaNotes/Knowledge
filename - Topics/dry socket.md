- (alveolar osteitis) a painful dental condition in which the normal healing of a tooth socket has been disturbed. Instead of being filled with a blood clot the socket is empty as a result of a nonspecific event; treatment consists of flushing out the socket, placement of medicated dressings, pain relief, and self-care. The condition normally resolves within 14 days.
