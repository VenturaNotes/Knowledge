- (RPI) An index of the prices of goods and services in retail shops purchased by average households, expressed in percentage terms relative to a base year, which is taken as 100 . For example, if 1987 is taken as the base year for the UK (i.e. average prices in January $1987=100$ ), then in 1946 the RPI stood at 7.4, and in May 2015 at 258.5. The RPI is published by the Office for National Statistics on a monthly basis and includes the prices of some 650 goods and services in 11 groups. The prices of the goods are checked every month and individual items and groups are weighted to reflect their relative importance. Weightings are regularly updated by the Family Expenditure Survey. Although the RPI is still widely used and quoted, it is no longer the main official measure of the rate of inflation (see Consumer Price Index).
