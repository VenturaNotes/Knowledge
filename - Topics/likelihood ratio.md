- the degree to which a test result will change the odds that a patient has a disease. The likelihood ratio for a positive test expresses the degree to which the odds that a patient has a disease increase following a positive test. The likelihood ratio for a negative test expresses the degree to which the odds that a patient has a disease decrease following a negative test. Likelihood ratios depend on the sensitivity and specificity of the test.

- $n$. 
- (1) In statistics, the ratio of two likelihood functions at a given value, especially the ratio of a likelihood function to the maximum likelihood, or in Bayesian inference, the ratio between (a) the probability of an observation or datum conditional on a hypothesis and (b) the probability of the same observation or datum conditional on an alternative hypothesis: $P\left(D \mid H_{1}\right) / P\left(D \mid H_{2}\right)$. 
- (2) In signal detection theory, the ratio (at a particular cutoff or criterion level of sensory activation) given by the probability of a response being due to signal plus noise divided by the probability of its being due to noise alone. Symbol: $\beta$.
