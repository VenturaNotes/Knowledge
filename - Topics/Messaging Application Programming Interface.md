- A messaging application programming interface (MAPI) is a programming interface that allows an application to transmit or receive email over the Microsoft Mail system. Fortunately, the MAPI system easily integrates with many programs. There are many programs that are MAPI compliant. This includes Microsoft Outlook, Scalix, Zimbra, HP Open Mail, and many more.
