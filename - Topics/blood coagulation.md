- (blood clotting) the process whereby blood is converted from a liquid to a solid state. The process may be initiated by contact of blood with a foreign surface (intrinsic system) or with damaged tissue (extrinsic system). These systems involve the interaction of a variety of substances (coagulation factors) and lead to the production of the enzyme thrombin, which converts the soluble blood protein fibrinogen to the insoluble protein fibrin, forming the blood clot. Finally, fibrin is broken down by the action of plasmin. Anticoagulants and tissue plasminogen activators act by inhibiting or activating various pathways in this cascade (see illustration). Blood coagulation is an essential mechanism for the arrest of bleeding (haemostasis). See also PLATELET ACTIVATION.
