## Source[^2]
- A strip of ectoderm, above the notochord, that lies along the central axis of the early embryos (see GASTRULA) of chordates and develops into the central nervous system. Under the influence of chordamesoderm, the neural plate folds and forms the neural tube; this process is called neurulation. During the stage when the neural tube is forming the embryo is known as a neurula. Cells along each side of the neural plate become detached and lie between the neural tube and the overlying epidermis as neural crest cells. Subsequently they migrate away to give rise to a variety of cell types, including neurons and other cells of the peripheral nervous system, bones, and connective tissues of the head, and melanocytes in the skin.
