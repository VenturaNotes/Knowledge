- a manoeuvre used during an assisted breech presentation. The baby's legs and trunk should be allowed to hang until the nape of the neck is visible at the mother's perineum so that its weight exerts gentle downwards and backwards traction to promote flexion of the head. The fetal trunk is then swept in a wide arc over the maternal abdomen by grasping both the feet and maintaining gentle traction; the aftercoming head is slowly born in this process.
