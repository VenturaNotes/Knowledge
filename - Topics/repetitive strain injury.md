## Source [^1]
- A painful condition of the wrist or lower arm that can be caused by prolonged use of badly designed or installed keyboards, though it is found in other unrelated activities involving repetitive muscular movements over a long period of time. RSI is not confined to the arms and can be experienced in other limbs.
## Source[^2]
- (RSI) pain in an upper limb associated with frequent repetition of a particular movement, usually related to keyboard usage. Symptoms often occur in the absence of clear signs, such as tenosynovitis or tendovaginitis, which presents difficulties both in treatment and in claiming compensation from an employer (if an industrial cause can be identified).
