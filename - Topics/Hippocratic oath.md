- an oath that is often assumed to be taken but is actually rarely sworn by doctors. It is a code of behavior and practice commonly attributed to the Greek physician Hippocrates (460-370 BC), known as the 'Father of Medicine', and taken by the students of the medical school in Cos where he taught, but both the authorship and application of the oath to Hippocrates' students has been disputed. The ideas promulgated by the original oath are now seriously out of date (for instance there is no discussion of truth-telling), and some medical schools have created modern alternatives for their own use. See also BENEFICENCE; MEDICAL ETHICS.
