- In activity-based costing, a collection of indirect costs grouped according to the activity involved. To identify the costs of each activity, cost pool managers will have to ask questions such as:
	- What staff are involved with the activity?
	- What machinery, equipment, vehicles, and computers are used by staff?
	- What materials are used for the activity?
- Each activity cost pool has one or more relevant activity measures (or cost drivers) that are used in allocating costs: for some common examples, see the table.

| Activity Cost Pool       | Activity Measure          |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| Order processing         | Number of orders          |
| Product design           | Number of product designs |
| Deliveries               | Number of deliveries      |
| Other costs not included | Not applicable            |
- Activity cost pool. Some common cost pools with relevant activity measures.
- The size of a particular cost pool will vary widely from one organization to another. For example, a cost pool for order processing may include hundreds of staff in a large organization, whereas a smaller organization may not have a separate cost pool for this activity as it involves only one or two staff. Note that some costs may not be included in any activity cost pool, usually because they are too minor or too difficult to allocate in this way.
