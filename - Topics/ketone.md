## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. any member of a group of organic compounds consisting of a carbonyl group (=CO) flanked by two alkyl groups. The ketones acetoacetic acid, acetone, and $\beta$-hydroxybutyrate (known as ketone (or acetone) bodies) are produced during the metabolism of fats. See also KETOSIS.
## Source[^2]
- Any one of a group of organic compounds that contain the carbonyl group ( $\text{>C=O}$) linked to two hydrocarbon groups. The ketone group is a carbonyl group with two single bonds to other carbon atoms ($-\mathrm{CO}-$). Examples are acetone (propanone), $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COCH}_{3}$, and methyl ethyl ketone (butanone), $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{COC}_{2} \mathrm{H}_{5}$. See also KETONE BODY.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A chemical compound consisting of a carbonyl group joined to two like or unlike alkyl radicals and containing volatile substances that are psychotropic when inhaled. See also inhalant-related disorders, Solvent ABUSE. \[German Keton, from Aketon acetone]
