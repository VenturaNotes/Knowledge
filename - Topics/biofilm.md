- $n$. an organized layer of microorganisms in which the cells stick to each other as well as to a surface. Biofilm may be implicated in several disease processes, including dental infections (see PLAQUE), endocarditis, infections of surgical implants, lung infections in people with cystic fibrosis, and glue ear. Its organized structure makes the biofilm resistant to attack.
