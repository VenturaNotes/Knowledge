- $n$. inflammation in the tissues around the bladder, causing pain in the pelvis, fever, and symptoms of cystitis. It usually results from infection in the Fallopian tubes or uterus, but can occasionally arise from severe infection in a diverticulum of the bladder itself. Treatment of pericystitis is directed to the underlying cause and usually involves antibiotic therapy. Pericystitis associated with a pelvic abscess clears when the abscess is surgically drained.
