## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- An event or condition in which an entire computer system or some part of it is unable to perform one or more prescribed functions. The failure may be due to a random process causing the hardware to cease to function, in which case hardware maintenance is required. Failure may also be due to a systematic cause such as an unrevealed or uncorrected fault in hardware or software. The fault may be due to an error, i.e. a mistake, occurring during (for example) design, specification, or operation. Each fault built into the hardware or software may be later revealed through a variety of processes such as review, static analysis, testing, or failure during operation of the computer. The result of revealing the fault at any time is a failure event for the hardware or software. Whether the failure is significant depends on the consequences and the timing.
- There is thus a relationship between failure, fault, and error. Note however that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. See also FAULT-TOLERANT SYSTEM.
