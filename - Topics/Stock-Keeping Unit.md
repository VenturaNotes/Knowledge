- An SKU is a code linked to a particular product. These codes are generally alphanumeric. On many retail products, the code also appears as a bar code. These barcodes can be scanned to provide SKU information such as product name, cost, and volume or amount. SKUs are used for intangible products too, such as labor at an automotive garage or services from a managed IT services provider.
