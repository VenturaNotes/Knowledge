- A sales team structure refers to the way a business organizes its sales team. For example, a business might have employees in different sales-related roles, departments, and locations. Businesses organize their sales teams in a specific way so they can maximize productivity, streamline resources, reduce labor costs, and maintain successful workflows. When creating a sales team structure, an organization might use a sales coverage model that places sales agents and other employees in particular roles or locations so they can target the highest value accounts.
