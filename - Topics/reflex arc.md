- the nervous circuit involved in a reflex, being at its simplest a sensory nerve with a receptor, linked at a synapse in the brain or spinal cord with a motor nerve, which supplies a muscle or gland (see illustration). In a simple reflex (such as the patellar reflex) only two neurons may be involved, but in other reflexes there may be several interneurons in the arc.
