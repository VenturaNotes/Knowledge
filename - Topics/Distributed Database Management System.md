## Source [^1]
- A DDBMS enables end users or application programmers to view a collection of physically separate databases as if they were stored on one computer. A DDBMS regularly synchronizes the data and ensures that updates and data deletion transfers to the data that is stored in other locations. This service prevents conflicting information from appearing at different locations in a business network.
