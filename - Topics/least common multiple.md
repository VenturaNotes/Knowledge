- For two non-zero integers $a$ and $b$, an integer that is a multiple of both is a common multiple. Of all the positive common multiples, the least is the least common multiple (lcm), denote by $[a,b]$ or $lcm(a,b)$. The $lcm$ of $a$ and $b$ has the property of dividing any other common multiple of $a$ and $b$. If the prime decompositions of $a$ and $b$ are known, the $lcm$ is easily obtained: for example, if $a = 168 = 2^3*3*7$ and $b = 180 = 2^2*3^2*5$, then the lcm is $2^3*3^2*5*7 = 2520$. For positive integers $a$ and $b$, the lcm is equal to $ab/(a,b),$where $(a,b)$ is the [[greatest common divisor]] (gcd). The gcd can be efficiently found using the Euclidean Algorithm.
- Similarly, any finite set of non-zero integers, $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ has an lcm denoted by $[a_1, a_2, ..., a_n].$
