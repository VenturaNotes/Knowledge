- A temporary storage location where a section cut or copied from displayed textual or graphical information is held until it can be pasted into another location. The technique can be used within a text editor or word processor session to move or copy within a given document, or in a graphical user interface to move items between one application and another. For instance, part of a spreadsheet display could be copied into the clipboard and then inserted into a word processor document.
