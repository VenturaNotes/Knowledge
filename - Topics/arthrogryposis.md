- $n$. congenital limitation of joint movement due to contractures affecting two or more joints. This is accompanied by joint stiffness, cylindrical limbs, and absence of skin creases. The most common of such syndromes is arthrogryposis multiplex congenita, a congenital condition of multiple contractures in which muscles are replaced by fibrous tissue, resulting in narrow limbs. Treatment, which begins soon after birth, consists initially of manipulation and splintage of deformed joints followed by contracture release and osteotomies.
