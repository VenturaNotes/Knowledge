## Source [^1]
- It consists of three major divisions: the [[medulla oblongata]], [[pons]], and [[midbrain]]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the enlarged extension upwards within the skull of the spinal cord, consisting of the medulla oblongata, the pons, and the midbrain. The pons and medulla are together known as the bulb, or bulbar area. Attached to the midbrain are the two cerebral hemispheres. See BRAIN.
## Source[^3]
- The part of the brain comprising the medulla oblongata, the midbrain, and the pons. Superficially it resembles and is continuous with the spinal cord. The midbrain controls and integrates reflex activities (such as breathing and swallowing) that originate in higher centers of the brain. The reticular formation (sometimes called the reticular activating system) is a network of neural fibres and cell bodies that extends the length of the brainstem. It receives sensory inputs of all kinds and regulates how much attention we give to them by acting as a sensory filter. It also influences muscle tone, and is thus a crucial part of the system governing arousal, wakefulness, and sleep. Ascending fibres of the reticular formation connect with neurons in the adjacent thalamus and hypothalamus, which in turn influence the cerebral cortex.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. The stalklike structure at the bottom of the brain between the cerebral hemispheres and the spinal cord, consisting of the midbrain, the pons, and the medulla oblongata, containing the nuclei of most of the cranial nerves and controlling consciousness and certain vegetative functions such as breathing and the operation of the heart and lungs. Also written brain stem.
