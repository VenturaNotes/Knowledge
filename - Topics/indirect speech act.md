- $n$. An utterance whose communicative purpose is masked by its grammatical form. For example, the utterance Would you like to set the table? is grammatically a question, but it masks the speaker's real communicative purpose, which is not to enquire about the listener's likes or dislikes but to tell the listener to do something. See also SPEECH ACT.
