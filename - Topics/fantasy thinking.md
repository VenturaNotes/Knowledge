- $n$. In analytical psychology, a form of thinking based on fantasy (1) that relies on imagery, emotion, and intuition, without logical or moral constraints. It is closely related to the primary process of psychoanalysis, and it occurs in dreams and mythology; it is debatable whether it should be called thinking. Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) contrasted it with directed thinking (Collected Works, 5, paragraphs 4-46).
