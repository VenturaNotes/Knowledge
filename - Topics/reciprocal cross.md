- A cross reversing the roles of males and females to confirm the results obtained from an earlier cross. For example, if the pollen (male) from tall plants is transferred to the stigmas (female) of dwarf plants in one cross, the reciprocal cross would use the pollen of dwarf plants to pollinate the stigmas of tall plants.
