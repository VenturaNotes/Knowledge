- The study of bacteria, including their identification, form, function, genetics, reproduction, and classification. Much attention is focused on the role of bacteria as agents of disease in animals, including humans, and in plants, and on methods of controlling pathogenic bacteria in the food chain and elsewhere in the environment. However, bacteriologists also investigate the many benefits of bacteria, e.g. in the production of antibiotics, enzymes, and amino acids, and in sewage treatment. See biOTECHNOLOGY.
