- Frequency reuse is the process by which frequencies are allocated to new users. A cellular region, which is isolated to a certain geographic area, is allotted a certain number of frequencies. Within this region, cellular frequencies can be reused under certain circumstances. This has many benefits. The chief benefit is that system capacity can be increased without increasing the bandwidth of frequencies.
