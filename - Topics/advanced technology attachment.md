- A parallel interface used for attaching storage devices and supported by the IBM PC BIOS (see also IDE, EIDE). ATA was followed by ATA-2, used in the EIDE interface; the current version is ATA-7. ATA is now called [[Parallel ATA]] (PATA) to distinguish it from Serial ATA, which has largely superseded it.
