- $n$. A component of a complex tone, having a frequency that is an integral multiple of the fundamental frequency. The first overtone, also called the second harmonic, has twice the frequency of the fundamental and is therefore an octave higher; the second overtone or third harmonic has three times the frequency of the fundamental; and so on. Also called a harmonic. See also MISSING FUNDAMENTAL ILLUSION.
