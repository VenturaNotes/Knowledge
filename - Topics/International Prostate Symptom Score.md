- (IPSS) a self-administered questionnaire, completed by men with lower urinary tract symptoms, which consists of seven questions based on the extent of symptoms and a single quality-of-life question. It gives a numerical score, on a scale of 0 to 35 , to indicate the severity of the patient's symptoms. A score of $0-7$ indicates mild symptoms, 8-19 moderate symptoms, and 20-35 severe symptoms. The quality-of-life question is scored from $0-6$.
