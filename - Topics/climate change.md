- A significant and lasting change in the statistical distribution of meteorological elements (e.g. wind speeds, temperatures, precipitation) calculated for different periods but relating to the same area. The timescale of climate change may range from decades to millions of years. Climate change can result from natural factors such as changes in solar activity, long-period changes in the Earth's orbital elements (eccentricity, obliquity of the ecliptic, precession of equinoxes), or natural internal processes of the climate system. Climate change occurring through the activities of mankind is termed anthropogenic climate change. See also GLOBAL WARMING.

- Any alteration in the earth's climate whether due to natural causes or human (i.e. anthropogenic) activities. Evidence from the fossil record and geophysical data shows that the earth's climate has undergone periods of warming and cooling throughout geological time, due primarily to shifts in the earth's orbit around the sun. These fluctuations are linked with changes in global glaciation levels, and in some cases mass extinctions of organisms. In the period since 1850 the earth has been warming at a rate unprecedented in recent geological history, a fact attributed chiefly to anthropogenic emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases from the burning of fossil fuels (see GREENHOUSE EFFECT). The average temperature of both the atmosphere and oceans has risen, and energy in the global climate system has increased. Besides melting glaciers, reducing the extent of snow and ice, and raising sea levels, global warming is changing rainfall patterns, with longer dry spells and bouts of more intense precipitation, and this trend is projected to accelerate in future. Average global temperatures are predicted to rise by $1.5-5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ by the end of the 21st century, depending on future carbon emissions. These changes are reflected in natural communities worldwide. Average temperature ranges are shifting rapidly towards the poles, and species that cannot adapt quickly enough must either extend their range, migrate, or die. This particularly affects organisms living on islands or mountains, where physical limits to extension of species' ranges are quickly reached. The impact on agriculture is variable: some crops are able to grow in hitherto unsuitable areas, whereas other areas are becoming more prone to droughts, affecting farming practices. Pests also may move into new regions, threatening established agriculture and forestry. Warmer temperatures and increased atmospheric dioxide mean that more carbon dioxide is dissolving in the oceans as carbonic acid. For example, coral organisms are harmed by both warming and acidification, with damaging consequences for the wider marine ecosystems and local fisheries. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was set up in 1988 by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Association to review the current state of knowledge about climate change and its potential environmental and socioeconomic impacts. It draws information from scientists around the world and periodically publishes Assessment Reports, intended to inform the national policies of its 195 member countries to reduce carbon emissions and mitigate the effects of climate change.
