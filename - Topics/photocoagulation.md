- $n$. the destruction of tissue by heat released from the absorption of light shone on it. In eye disorders the technique is used to destroy diseased retinal tissue, occurring, for example, as a complication of diabetes (diabetic retinopathy) and macular degeneration; and to produce scarring between the retina and choroid, thus binding them together, in cases of retinal detachment. Photocoagulation of the retina is usually done with an argon or diode laser.
- Photocoagulation is also a method of arresting bleeding by causing coagulation, usually using an infrared light source.
