- (PTH-RP) a protein that is secreted by certain malignant tumors and is the main cause of malignant hypercalcaemia. PTH-RP, which has effects similar to parathyroid hormone, stimulates generalized bone resorption and excessive calcium reabsorption in the kidney tubules. It is most commonly produced by lung tumours, squamous-cell carcinomas of other organs, melanomas, and tumors of the breast, liver, pancreas, bladder, and prostate.
