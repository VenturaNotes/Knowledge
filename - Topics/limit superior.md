- Given a real sequence $(a_n)$ which is bounded above, the sequence $b_n = \text{sup}\{a_n, a_{n+1}, a_{n+2},...\}$ is decreasing and converges to a limit, the limit superior, denoted as limsup$a_n$. Similarly if $(a_n)$ is bounded below, the sequence $c_n = \text{inf}\{a_n,a_{n+1},a_{n+2},...\}$ is increasing and converges to a limit, the limit inferior, denoted as liminf$a_n$. If $b_n$ or $c_n$ tends to $\pm \infty$, then we define limsup $a_n$ or liminf $a_n$ accordingly. Equivalently, limsup $a_n$ (liminf $a_n$) is the greatest (least) limit point of the sequence $(a_n)$. Note limsup $a_n =$ liminf$a_n$ if and only if the sequence $a_n$ converges (including to $\pm \infty$).
