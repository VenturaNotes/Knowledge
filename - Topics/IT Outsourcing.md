- IT outsourcing is when SMBs give IT-related tasks to an external company. These tasks might include:
	- Server management
	- Cloud computing
	- Networking
	- Cybersecurity
	- Infrastructure management
	- Data governance
	- Administrative tasks
	- Software management (Software-as-a-Service or SaaS)
- Outsourcing helps to free up the resources required to manage and maintain IT processes or equipment such as servers, networks and data centers. Businesses negotiate contracts with external providers, resulting in service-level agreements (SLAs) that detail the requirements for outsourced tasks.
