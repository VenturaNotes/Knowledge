- An externality that is felt through prices rather than through quantities. For example, migration of workers into a country will increase labour supply and lower wages. This is a pecuniary externality for the native workers of the country who suffer from reduced real income. In the presence of competitive markets such an externality does not result in inefficiency, because the price is adjusting to ensure a Pareto-efficient outcome.
