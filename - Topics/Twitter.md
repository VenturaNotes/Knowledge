- A social-media platform, first launched in 2006, that enables users to post and read short messages over the Internet. Messages, known as tweets, may be up to 140 characters in length and are received by all users who have chosen to 'follow' the sender. As those who receive messages may opt to 'retweet' them to their followers, and so on, a popular tweet may quickly reach a very large readership. Twitter now has over 313 million active users (2017) and is widely used by businesses for marketing and publicity.
