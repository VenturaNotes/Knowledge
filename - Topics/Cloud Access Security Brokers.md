- CASBs are digital gatekeepers between an organizationâ€™s network and any cloud-based services they may use. A CASB is a layer of security protection that helps companies enforce their security policies even when connecting to a third-party vendor or service. CASBs may include or offer extra security features such as firewalls for malware protection and data loss prevention (DLP). Many use a range of authentication protocols to ensure only authorized parties can access the relevant company services. CASBs may also highlight high-risk web-based applications. They often use credential mapping or data encryption as well as standard username and password security.
