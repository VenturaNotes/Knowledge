## Source [^1]
- Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication enables wired and wireless devices to exchange information. This process automates data transmission and measurement between devices and transfers data to a network. The most popular components of an M2M system are:
	- Field-deployed wireless devices with embedded sensors
	- RFID-Wireless communication networks with wireline access
- Examples of M2M communication include Wi-Fi, WiMAX, wireless LAN (WLAN), cellular communication, generic DSL (xDSL) and fiber to the x (FTTx). This type of communication typically includes two endpoints that use hardware to enable access to a network. These endpoints collect information and transfer it to the network.
