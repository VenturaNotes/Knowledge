- the development of a small area of avascular bone on the surface of a joint, most commonly the knee, which typically occurs in males aged between 10 to 20 years. Sometimes the area with its overlying articular cartilage can become loose and may eventually detach. Symptoms include activity-related pain, localized tenderness, stiffness, and swelling. In children, spontaneous healing may occur, but adults usually require surgery to reattach or remove the fragment.
