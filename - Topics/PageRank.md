- An algorithm used by the search engine Google to evaluate the importance of any individual web page. In simple terms, it does this by gauging the number of relevant and useful links between the page in question and other sites, on the assumption that this reflects the value of the page to Internet users. As PageRank determines the prominence of a page in Google's search-result listings, businesses will often take deliberate steps to secure a higher rank for their website. See SEARCH-ENGINE OPTIMIZATION.
