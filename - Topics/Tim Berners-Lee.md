- (1955- ) British software developer who invented the World Wide Web. After graduating in physics from Oxford University he worked as a computer programmer. While working briefly for CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) at Geneva in 1980 he developed a hypertext system for sharing information. Returning to CERN (1984), in 1989 he proposed an Internet-hosted global hypertext system, for which he coined the term 'World Wide Web'. This concept was implemented by Berners-Lee himself: he created the first Web browser and Web server and in 1991 launched the first website. As the Web began its explosive growth, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 and remains its Director. He also holds the 3Com Founders Chair at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory. He became a director of the World Wide Web Foundation when it was launched in 2009, is President of the Open Data Institute, and leads the Alliance for Affordable Internet.
