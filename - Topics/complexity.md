- The ‘ease’ or ‘difficulty’ of solving computational problems, measured in terms of some resource consumed during computation. The resource can be an abstract measure, or something specific like space or time. The analysis of the complexity of computational problems is a very active and large area of research at present and has important practical implications. See also COMPLEXITY CLASSES, COMPLEXITY MEASURE.
