- A section or area of an organization under the responsibility of a manager for which budgets are prepared; these budgets are compared with actual performance as part of the budgetary control process. A budget center may be a function, department, section, individual, cost center, or any combination of these that the management wishes to treat as a budget center. It is usual to produce regular financial statements on the basis of each budget center so that each budget-center manager is aware of its budgeted and actual performance and any variances that arise.
