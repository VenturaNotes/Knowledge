- (3) (of statistics data) A change of scale used to improve the validity of statistical analyses. For data in which small values have smaller variance than large values a logarithmic or square-root transformation is often recommended. For data in the form of proportions, a transformation from the scale $(0,1)$ to an infinite scale is advisable before performing analysis of variance or regression analysis. Several transformations exist for proportions, such as the logistic or log-odds-ratio that is used in the analysis of generalized linear models. Appropriate transformations may be suggested by studying residuals in a regression analysis.
## Source[^2]
- (1) A permanent heritable change in a cell, particularly a bacterial cell, that occurs as a result of its acquiring foreign DNA. For example, nonvirulent bacterial cells can be transformed into virulent forms if cultured in a medium containing killed virulent bacteria. In cloning, the host cells are transformed by the insertion of recombinant DNA. See GENE Cloning. 
- (2) The conversion of a normal cell into a malignant cell (see CANCER), which is brought about by mutation of genes and consequent cellular changes, sometimes through the action of carcinogens or oncogenic viruses.
