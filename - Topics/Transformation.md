- (3) (of statistics data) A change of scale used to improve the validity of statistical analyses. For data in which small values have smaller variance than large values a logarithmic or square-root transformation is often recommended. For data in the form of proportions, a transformation from the scale $(0,1)$ to an infinite scale is advisable before performing analysis of variance or regression analysis. Several transformations exist for proportions, such as the logistic or log-odds-ratio that is used in the analysis of generalized linear models. Appropriate transformations may be suggested by studying residuals in a regression analysis.
