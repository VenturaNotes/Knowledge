## Source [^1]
- $n$. a compound formed by replacing the hydroxyl $(-\mathrm{OH})$ group of a sugar by another group. (If the sugar is glucose the compound is known as a glucoside.) Glycosides found in plants include some pharmacologically important products, such as the cardiac glycoside digoxin, derived from the foxglove (Digitalis). Other plant glycosides are natural food toxins, present in cassava, almonds, and other plant products, and may yield hydrogen cyanide if the plant is not prepared properly before eating.
