## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a compound formed by replacing the hydroxyl $(-\mathrm{OH})$ group of a sugar by another group. (If the sugar is glucose the compound is known as a glucoside.) Glycosides found in plants include some pharmacologically important products, such as the cardiac glycoside digoxin, derived from the foxglove (Digitalis). Other plant glycosides are natural food toxins, present in cassava, almonds, and other plant products, and may yield hydrogen cyanide if the plant is not prepared properly before eating.
## Source[^2]
- Any one of a group of compounds consisting of a pyranose sugar residue, such as glucose, linked to a noncarbohydrate residue (R) by a glycosidic bond: the hydroxyl group $(-\mathrm{OH})$ on carbon-1 of the sugar is replaced by -OR. Glycosides are widely distributed in plants; examples are the anthocyanin pigments and the cardiac glycosides, such as digoxin (see DIGITALIS) and ouabain, which are used medicinally for their stimulant effects on the heart.
