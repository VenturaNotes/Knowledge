- A plant that can tolerate a high concentration of salt (sodium chloride) in the soil. Such conditions occur in salt marshes and mudflats. Halophytes possess some of the structural modifications of xerophytes; for example, many of them are succulents. In addition, they are physiologically adapted to withstand the high salinity of the soil water: their root cells have a higher than normal concentration of solutes, which enables them to take up water by osmosis from the surrounding soil. Moreover, some have salt glands in the leaves that excrete salt. Examples of halophytes are mangrove trees (see MANGROVE SWAMP), thrift (Armeria), sea lavender (Limonium), and rice grass (Spartina). Compare HYDROPHYTE; MESOPHYTE.
