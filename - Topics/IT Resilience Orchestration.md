- IT resilience orchestration (ITRO) software products aim to improve workload recovery following unplanned outages. These solutions automate disaster recovery (DR) processes, particularly DR runbooks, support application resilience, and migrate workloads from on-premises data servers to public clouds. ITRO products can lower the costs of application dependency mapping, DR runbook creation, exercise efforts, and reporting.
