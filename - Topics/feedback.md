- Response to operator input that indicates that the input has been understood and the desired action accomplished. See also ACKNOWLEDGMENT, ECHOING, PROMPT.
## Source[^2]
- Information or opinions about the performance of a product, system, intervention (e.g. a management development or training program), or employee. Important sources of feedback include clients and customers, users of a product or system, and an employee's supervisors or fellow workers. Regular and reliable feedback is essential to employee evaluation and performance appraisal, and its absence may be detrimental to job satisfaction (see CORE JOB CHARACTERISTICS). Feedback also plays a key role in modern management philosophies of continuous improvement, such as total quality management. See MULTISOURCE FEEDBACK.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. (in physiology) the coupling of the output of a process to the input. Feedback mechanisms are important in regulating many physiological processes; for example, the production of hormones and neurotransmitters. In negative feedback, a rise in the output of a substance will inhibit a further increase in its production, either directly or indirectly (see NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP). In positive feedback, a rise in the output of a substance is associated with an increase in the output of another substance, either directly or indirectly.
## Source[^4]
- The use of part of the output of a system to control its performance. In positive feedback, the output is used to enhance the input; in negative feedback, the output is used to reduce the input. Many biological processes rely on negative feedback. As the population of a species expands, so its food supply per individual is diminished; the result is that the population then begins to fall. Many biochemical processes are controlled by feedback inhibition. Feedback mechanisms play an important role in maintaining a state of equilibrium within an organism (see HOMEOSTASIS).
## Source[^5]
- $n$. The return of part of a system's output to its input, usually as a means of achieving self-correction or modification of performance. In negative feedback an increase in output causes a decrease in input, as in a thermostat or other self-regulating mechanism and many homeostatic biological processes including EEG waves. In positive feedback an increase in output causes an increase in input, as in the howling of a public address system when a microphone is held too close to its loudspeaker. The term is also used informally for information given to research participants about their own performance or behaviour. See also CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL, CYBERNETICS, DELAYED AUDITORY FEEDBACK, OPEN-LOOP CONTROL, TOTE. Compare FEEDFORWARD.
