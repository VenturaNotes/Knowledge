- Information or opinions about the performance of a product, system, intervention (e.g. a management development or training program), or employee. Important sources of feedback include clients and customers, users of a product or system, and an employee's supervisors or fellow workers. Regular and reliable feedback is essential to employee evaluation and performance appraisal, and its absence may be detrimental to job satisfaction (see CORE JOB CHARACTERISTICS). Feedback also plays a key role in modern management philosophies of continuous improvement, such as total quality management. See MULTISOURCE FEEDBACK.
