- Information or opinions about the performance of a product, system, intervention (e.g. a management development or training program), or employee. Important sources of feedback include clients and customers, users of a product or system, and an employee's supervisors or fellow workers. Regular and reliable feedback is essential to employee evaluation and performance appraisal, and its absence may be detrimental to job satisfaction (see CORE JOB CHARACTERISTICS). Feedback also plays a key role in modern management philosophies of continuous improvement, such as total quality management. See MULTISOURCE FEEDBACK.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. (in physiology) the coupling of the output of a process to the input. Feedback mechanisms are important in regulating many physiological processes; for example, the production of hormones and neurotransmitters. In negative feedback, a rise in the output of a substance will inhibit a further increase in its production, either directly or indirectly (see NEGATIVE FEEDBACK LOOP). In positive feedback, a rise in the output of a substance is associated with an increase in the output of another substance, either directly or indirectly.
