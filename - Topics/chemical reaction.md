## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A change in which one or more chemical elements or compounds (the reactants) form new compounds (the products). All reactions are to some extent reversible; i.e. the products can also react to give the original reactants. However, in many cases the extent of this back reaction is negligibly small, and the reaction is regarded as irreversible. See also ENDERGONIC REACTION; EXERGONIC REACTION.
