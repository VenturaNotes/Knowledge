- (pl. plastoglobuli) A densely staining droplet found, often in large numbers, in plastids of plant cells. Plastoglobuli consist of lipid pigment and are especially prominent in coloured plastids (chromoplasts), for example in ripening fruits. Plastoglobuli also occur in chloroplasts, but are masked by the green chlorophyll. When the chlorophyll breaks down as the leaves start to die in autumn, the pigmented plastoglobuli become apparent as the red or yellow 'fall' colours.
