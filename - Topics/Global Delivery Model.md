- Global delivery model (GDM) refers to the resources and methods used when an organization's service provider sources skills from around the world for IT and business-related tasks. It can include IT skills, labor, tools, procedures, policies, management, human-resource functions, delivery processes, and infrastructure. All of these assets and methodologies come together toÂ increase the success of an enterprise's projects. A GDM should consist of a secure and scalable global infrastructure supported by investments to manage or mitigate risks within an organization.
