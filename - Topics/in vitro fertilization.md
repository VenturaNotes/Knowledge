- (IVF) fertilization of an ovum outside the body, the resultant zygote being incubated to the blastocyst stage and then implanted in the uterus. The technique, pioneered in Britain, resulted in 1978 in the birth of the first test-tube baby. IVF may be undertaken when a woman has blocked Fallopian tubes, unexplained infertility, endometriosis, or ovulation disorders; it is also carried out for purposes of surrogacy and egg donation. The mother-to-be is given hormone therapy causing a number of ova to mature at the same time (see SUPEROVULATION). Several of them are then removed from the ovary through a laparoscope. The ova are mixed with spermatozoa and incubated in a culture medium until the blastocyst is formed. The blastocyst is then implanted in the mother's uterus and the pregnancy proceeds normally. IVF is regulated by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 via the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority.
