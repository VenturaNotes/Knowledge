- (AFP) $n$. a protein that is formed in the liver and yolk sac of the fetus and is present in the fetal serum and secondarily in maternal blood. Maternal AFP is used as a marker in prenatal screening tests, which can be performed between the 15th and 20th weeks of pregnancy. Levels are elevated in open neural tube defects (e.g. spina bifida), open abdominal wall defects (e.g. gastroschisis), fetal death, and multiple pregnancy. Levels of AFP are decreased in Down's syndrome. However, AFP levels are affected by the length of gestation and the mother's weight, and these factors must be considered when interpreting the results. When levels are unexpectedly high or low, further investigations (for example detailed ultrasonography) are indicated.
- Alpha-fetoprotein is also produced by certain tumours, including malignant teratomas and primary liver tumours (hepatomas). See TUMOUR MARKER.
