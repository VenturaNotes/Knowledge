- (biomimetics) The science of applying or emulating designs found in living organisms to make materials, devices, or machines for use in engineering, construction, technology, medicine, and other fields. For example, the properties and shapes of natural surfaces, such as insect wings, birds' feathers, or leaves, have inspired many innovations in materials science and aerodynamics. Moreover, nature typically employs materials that have minimal environmental impact and uses them in a resource-efficient way. Biomimicry is increasingly seen as a source of more sustainable design in many areas.
