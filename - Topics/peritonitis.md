- $n$. inflammation of the peritoneum. Primary peritonitis is caused by bacteria spread via the bloodstream: examples are pneumococcal peritonitis and tuberculous peritonitis. Symptoms are diffuse abdominal pain and swelling, with fever and weight loss. Fluid may accumulate in the peritoneal cavity (see ASCITES) or the infection may complicate existing ascites (see SPONTANEOUS BACTERIAL PERITONITIS). Secondary peritonitis is due to perforation or rupture of an abdominal organ (for example, a duodenal ulcer, the gall bladder, or the vermiform appendix), allowing access of bacteria and irritant digestive juices to the peritoneum. This produces sudden severe abdominal pain, first at the site of rupture but later becoming generalized. Shock develops, and the abdominal wall becomes rigid; X-ray examination may reveal gas within the peritoneal cavity. Treatment is usually by surgical repair of the perforation, but in some cases conservative treatment using antibiotics and intravenous fluid may be used. Subphrenic abscess is a possible complication. Meconium peritonitis occurs in newborn infants as a result of a perforated intestine; it is initially a sterile contamination of the peritoneum.
