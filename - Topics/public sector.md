## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- That part of the economy that involves the activities of the government and local authorities. This includes education, the health and social services, the police, local public services, etc., as well as stateowned industries and public corporations. Compare PRIVATE SECTOR.
## Source[^2]
- Those parts of the economy which are not controlled by individuals, voluntary organizations, or privately owned companies. The public sector thus includes government at all levels, national and local; government-owned firms; and quasi-autonomous non-governmental organizations. When government money is provided to bodies such as charities or housing associations, or privately owned public utilities are subject to close regulation by government-appointed bodies, the distinction between the public and private sectors is not clear-cut.
