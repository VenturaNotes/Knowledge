- One of the assets that appears in the balance sheet of a bank. It includes funds lent to discount houses, money brokers, the stock exchange, bullion brokers, corporate customers, and increasingly to other banks.At call money is repayable on demand, whereas short notice money implies that notice of repayment of up to 14 days will be given. After cash, money at call and short notice are the banksâ€™ most liquid assets. They are usually interest-earning secured loans but their importance lies in providing the banks with an opportunity to use their surplus funds and to adjust their cash and liquidity requirements.
