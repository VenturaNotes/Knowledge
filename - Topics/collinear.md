## Synthesis
- Two vectors are collinear if they lie on the same line 
	- This means one vector is a scalar multiple of the other
- Collinear vectors can
	- point in the same direction ($v$ and $2v$) 
	- point in opposite directions ($v$ and -$v$).
- If two vectors are collinear and at least one of them is non-zero, then they both lie on the same line that passes through the origin. 
	- Any scalar multiple of a vector ($kv)$ will lie on the line defined by $v$ and passing through the origin
		- #question Why are we restricting it to pass through the origin?
	- #question Why does one of them need to be non-zero for this to be true?
	- #question Why can't both lines be shifted away from the origin?
