- A person involved in setting up and funding a new company, including preparing its articles of association and memorandum of association, registering the company, finding directors, and raising subscriptions. The promoter is in a position of trust with regard to the new company and may not make an undisclosed profit or benefit at its expense. A promoter may be personally liable for the fulfilment of a contract entered into by, or on behalf of, the new company before it has been formed.

- (in protein synthesis) The region of a DNA molecule that signals the start of transcription. In eukaryote genes, the promoter typically has a core promoter very near to the transcription start site, often containing the base sequence TATA (hence it is called the TATA box). Other promoter elements are located 'upstream' of the core promoter and start site. Proteins called transcription factors bind to the promoter and ensure that the enzyme responsible for transcription, RNA polymerase, also binds correctly to the promoter with respect to the coding region of the gene. In prokaryotes and viruses, several genes can share the same promoter in units called operons. Prokaryote promoters have their own characteristic base sequence, the Pribnow box.
