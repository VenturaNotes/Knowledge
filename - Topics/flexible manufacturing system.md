- (FMS) An automated and computerized production line that can be reprogrammed to produce more than one product line. Use of a flexible manufacturing system enables companies to lower costs and vary production quickly in response to changes in consumer demand. The ability to reprogramme machines by means of software rather than the physical set-up makes FMS particularly applicable to handling batches of a fairly small range of products.
