- Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) is a term for software technologies that help organizations automatically handle IT security alerts and gather data about security threats. As the name suggests, SOAR tools fall under three categories: orchestration (integrating and connecting different applications), automation (analyzing massive amounts of logs and other data), and response (reporting and reacting to security threats once detected).
