## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (biological medical product) $n$. in the widest sense, any therapeutic agent isolated or semisynthesized from a living source, as opposed to a totally synthesized drug. This would include blood and blood components, vaccines, and antibodies. However, the term is now mainly used to mean agents produced for clinical use by genetic engineering, such as interferon, interleukin, monoclonal antibodies, and cytokine inhibitors. Such products are often referred to as biologics. See also BIOLOGICAL THERAPY; BIOSIMILAR; BIOTECHNOLOGY.
