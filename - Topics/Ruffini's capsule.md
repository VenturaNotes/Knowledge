- (Ruffini's corpuscle) A specialized nerve ending, found in skin and in joint capsules and ligaments, that responds to pressure and stretching, providing information about certain types of touch stimuli and movements of joints and limbs. Named after Italian histologist Angelo Ruffino (1864-1929), it consists of a highly branched unmyelinated nerve ending within a spindle-shaped capsule, which is filled with a mesh of collagen fibres. The nerve endings weave around the collagen fibres and are activated by movement of surrounding tissues.
