- Acronym for projects in controlled environments. A method of project management, used by government information technology departments, that provides a shell within which to control a project throughout its life cycle. To the extent that this enables standardized procedures to be used, it allows managers to concentrate on content rather than process. It also permits a more structured and comparative evaluation of a process to be made.
