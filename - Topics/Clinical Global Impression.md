- (CGI) rating scales commonly used by clinicians to measure symptom severity and treatment response in treatment studies of patients with psychiatric illnesses. Many researchers consider them to be a good tool to measure the clinical utility or relevance of a given treatment. The Clinical Global Impression-Severity scale (CGI-S) is used to rate the severity of the patient's symptoms relative to the clinician's past experience with patients who have the same diagnosis. Scores range from 1 (normal) to 7 (extremely ill). The Clinical Global Impression-Improvement scale (CGI-I) measures change in the patient's presentation from baseline. Scores range from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse). A score of 4 indicates no change.
