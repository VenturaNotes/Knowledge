- Also known as account provisioning, user provisioning is the process of creating, managing, and maintaining user accounts and profiles. User provisioning can also refer to updating, modifying, or deleting an account or user profile. A company's email system is an example of user provisioning in use; a new email address is created when an employee joins the company and deleted when that employee leaves, thus updating their account/user information.
