## Synthesis
- A programming paradigm that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing state and mutable data
	- #question I'm confused. Is it saying we're trying to avoid changing mutable data or that it just involves mutable data? Would just like a better definition
## Source [^1]
- A programming paradigm where programs are constructed by applying and composing functions. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements.
