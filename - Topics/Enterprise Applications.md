- Enterprise Applications (EA) refers to a wide range of software system platforms that are designed for use by an entire organization rather than one individual user. While there are a plethora of them available, one enterprise application typically includes multiple different programs that are integrated into one and designed to work together. This means that the HR department, accounting, and the sales team, for instance, can all use the same application but for different needs.
