- Identity and access management (IAM) is a blanket term for the tools, processes, and policies designed to verify user identities and allow access to tools and information while restricting unauthorized access. IAM includes two related activities: authentication (verifying user identity) and authorization (giving authenticated users access to resources). IAM platforms use techniques such as single sign-on (SSO), which allows users to provide the same set of login credentials to multiple websites or applications, and multi-factor authentication (MFA), which requires users to verify their identity using more than one method of verification.
