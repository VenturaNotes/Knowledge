- A BTA is a geographical area used to determine where a personal communications service can operate. The Rand McNally 1992 Commercial Atlas and Marketing Guide coined the term. The FCC uses BTAs to issue 800MHz licenses to mobile service providers in:
	- United States
	- Puerto Rico
	- Guam
	- American Samoa
	- Northern Mariana Islands
	- U.S. Virgin Islands
- Each metropolitan trading area (MTA) comprises several BTAs. For example, Minneapolisâ€”St. Paul. As of 2021, there are 487 BTAs in the U.S., according to the FCC.
