- Any policy that aims to maximize current profits rather than long-term development and wealth. For example, cutting back on research and development reduces immediate costs but may lead to products becoming obsolescent in the future. A company may well experience problems of this kind if managers' salaries or bonuses are linked too closely to short-term results. Similarly, institutional and individual shareholders often overreact to a company's short-term results and policies, causing the company to lose the longer-term focus that is ultimately in the interests of all stakeholders.

- The conduct of a business with too much regard to short-run relative to longer-run results. For industry, this means spending too little on research and development, staff training, and investment in projects with a long lag in bringing in profits; for financial institutions, it means putting too much weight on short-term capital gains. Short-termism thus means discounting the future too heavily. The concept is necessarily subjective, as there is no objective way of deciding the correct rate at which future costs and benefits should be discounted.
