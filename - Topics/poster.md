- A placard or bill exhibited in a public place as an advertisement. Although there are over 200,000 legal poster sites in the UK, poster advertising accounts for less than $10 \%$ of the total advertising expenditure. Illegal attachment of posters or bills to empty shop windows, company hoardings, etc., is called flyposting. Flyposting is often undertaken at night by a small number of companies, all of whom jealously guard their regular territories. Flyposting is particularly popular with record companies, underground magazines, and some film companies.
