- The main stock exchange in Switzerland, based in Zurich. It was created as SWX Swiss Exchange in 1995, when the exchanges in Zurich, Geneva, and Basle adopted a single fully automated system for trading, clearing, and settlement (the Berne exchange remains independent). The price level is given daily by the Swiss Market Index (SMI). In 2001-02 it acquired the London-based electronic exchange virt-x, which became known as SWX Europe until all trading was moved to the Zurich exchange in 2009. SWX became SIX in 2008, when it merged with the SIS and Telekurs groups.
