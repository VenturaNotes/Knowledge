## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A nuclear reaction in which two nuclei, each of which has a low atomic number, combine to form a heavier nucleus, with the emission of a great deal of energy. The nucleosynthesis of many chemical elements occurs by nuclear fusion, which is the process that powers the stars. Because atomic nuclei are positively charged, it is necessary to have very high kinetic energies for nuclear fusion to occur, although the energy to overcome the repulsive electrostatic barrier is not as high as might be supposed from classical physics because of the quantum-mechanical tunnel effect through the barrier.
