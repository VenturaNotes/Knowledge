- (noncoding strand; template strand) The strand in duplex DNA that by convention contains the sequence of bases that is complementary to that of the messenger RNA (mRNA) transcribed from the DNA (except that the RNA has uracil substituting for thymine). It is the strand used as a template for mRNA assembly during transcription, and is complementary to the other strand of the DNA molecule, the coding strand. See also ANTISENSE DNA; NEGATIVE-SENSE.
