## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Measures amount of computing resources (time and space) that an algorithm consumes when it runs
	- Determines
		- How fast an algorithm will run
		- How much memory it will require
- It's a continuum
	- Some algorithms require linear time, quadratic, or even exponential time
	- Far end of continuum lie [[intractable problems]]
		- Solutions that can't be efficiently implemented
		- [[Heuristic algorithms]] are sought after to almost solve the problem and run in a reasonable amount of time
	- Further away exists algorithmic problems that can be stated but not solved
		- A good example is the [[halting problem]]
