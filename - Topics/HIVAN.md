- human immunodeficiency virus-associated nephropathy: a condition associated with HIV infection. The patient usually presents with nephrotic-range proteinuria (see NEPHROTIC SYNDROME) with microscopic haematuria, without oedema but with a rapid decline in renal function. Enlargement of the kidneys on ultrasound examination is a common finding, and HIVAN may precede other manifestations of HIV infection. Typical renal pathological findings are of a collapsing form of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. The clinical course is usually one of rapid decline in renal function.
