- Business process outsourcing (BPO) occurs when organizations outsource IT-related functions to an external company. These functions include:
	- Outsourcing customer service duties to a call center
	- Sub-contracting cybersecurity responsibilities to a third-party company
	- Delegating server management tasks to a managed service provider (MSP)
- An external service provider manages delegated tasks for a business, freeing up resources and labor in that organization. There are two categories of BPO services:
	- Horizontal services that external providers leverage across industries. For example, server management services for companies in all sectors.
	- Vertical-specific services that require specific industry knowledge. For example, outsourced social media management services for marketing companies.
