- A system of making payments by transferring money through a bank. The payer gives instructions naming the receiver and giving the receiver's sort code and account number. Several receivers may be listed and settled by a single transaction. The popularity of this system in the UK led the banks to introduce a credit-clearing system in 1961 and the Post Office to do so in 1968. The Bankers' Automated Clearing System (now Bacs) was introduced in 1969 (see UK Payments Administration). See also bank GIRO CREDIT; GIRO.
