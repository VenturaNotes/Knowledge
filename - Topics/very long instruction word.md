## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An architecture for parallel multi-core processors that is based on instruction-level parallelism (ILP). The instructions for each processor are merged together, indicating that they execute at the same time. VLIW is an architecture that simplifies hardware scheduling, at the expense of making the compiler more complex.
- VLIW: A VLIW machine is one in which a number of normal instructions are combined and are capable of simultaneous execution using parallel functional units. The instruction may be hundreds of bits long. A compiler must ensure that operations packaged in a VLIW do not have data dependencies that would be violated by their parallel execution. See also SUPERSCALAR.
