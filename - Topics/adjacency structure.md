- A means of representing a graph. The adjacency structure corresponding to a path $G$ is the set$$\{\text{Adj}(v)\mid v\text{ is a vertex in } G\}$$If $G$ is an undirected graph, then a vertex $w$ is in $\operatorname{Adj}(v)$ if and only if there is an edge in $G$ between $v$ and $w$; if $G$ is a directed graph, then $w$ is in $\operatorname{Adj}(v)$ if and only if there is an edge in $G$ directed from $v$ to $w$.
