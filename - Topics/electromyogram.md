- (EMG) A recording of the electrical activity of muscle fibers. It is obtained by means of electrodes inserted into the muscle, where they detect the action potentials of individual muscle units. The electrical signals are amplified by an apparatus (electromyograph) and displayed on an oscilloscope. Electromyograms are used in experimental muscle physiology and in diagnosing various nerve and muscle disorders.
