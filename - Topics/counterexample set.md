- $n$. In logic, the premises of an argument, followed by the conclusion with 'It is not true that' in place of 'Therefore'. For example, this is an argument: Pensioners who live in rented accommodation are eligible for the maximum tax rebate. I am a pensioner. I live in rented accommodation. Therefore I am eligible for the maximum tax rebate. The counterexample set of this argument is: Pensioners who live in rented accommodation are eligible for the maximum tax rebate. I am a pensioner. I live in rented accommodation. It is not true that I am eligible for the maximum tax rebate. An argument is valid precisely if its counterexample set is inconsistent, as this counterexample set obviously is.
