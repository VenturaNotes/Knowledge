- A Certified ScrumMaster (CSM) is a business professional that has obtained an entry-level Scrum Master certification. Certified professionals will typically have a good understanding of Scrum values, such as emphasizing accountability, teamwork, and using an iterative workflow to achieve set business goals.
- To receive this certification, business professionals must attend a course led by a Certified Scrum Trainer (CST) or be coached by a Certified Agile Coach (CAC). In addition to this, they are also required to complete 14 hours of hands-on online or in-person training with a CST or 25 hours of interaction with a CAC. Certified professionals can then fill the role of a Scrum Master or a Scrum team member.
