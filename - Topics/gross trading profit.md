- The profit of a company before deducting depreciation allowances, taxation, or debt interest. This is the profit derived from a company's trading activities. Debt interest has to be deducted from it to get gross profit. A company with high gearing and a large interest bill may make a loss overall, even if its gross trading profits are positive.
