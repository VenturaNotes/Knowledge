- $n$. A severe form of childhood epilepsy, twice as common in boys than girls, that appears during the first year of life and is characterized by frequent convulsions or seizures, accompanied initially by fever and resistant to conventional anticonvulsant medication. It is a rare disorder, with an incidence of about 1 in 30,000, and is believed to be caused by a non-inherited genetic defect affecting sodium channel and GABA receptor functioning. Children with Dravet syndrome typically manifest poor language development, ataxia, hyperactivity, and difficulty relating to others. Also called severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy (SMEI). DS abbrev. \[Named after the French neuropsychiatrist Charlotte Dravet (born 1936) who first described it in an article in the journal La Vie MÃ©dicale in 1978]
