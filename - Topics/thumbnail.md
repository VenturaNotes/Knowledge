- A thumbnail is a reduced version of an image or screenshot of a video that often contains a link to a larger version of the represented image. Thumbnails provide a preview of an image or video file, which is helpful when searching through various multimedia files at once. Instead of having to remember a file name or open each individual file to view its contents, users can simply scroll through the thumbnails and find the one that matches the image they wish to view.
