- Given a function $f: S \to S$, a subset A of S is invariant of $f(A) \subseteq A$. Note that this is a much weaker condition than requiring that $f(a) = a$ for all $a \in A$. For example, if $f$ reflects $\mathbb{R}^2$ in the x-axis, then the x-axis is invariant in the latter sense $\textemdash$ every point is fixed $\textemdash$ but any line parallel to the y-axis is an invariant set
