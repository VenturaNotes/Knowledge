- $n$. A non-technical name for muscle dysmorphia. The word was first used in People magazine on 12 August 1985, and the US psychiatrist Harrison G. Pope Jr (born 1947) and several colleagues referred to it in an article in 1993 but initially renamed it reverse anorexia nervosa, before coining the term muscle dysmorphia a few years later. \[From big + (an)orexia, from Greek an- not or without + orexis appetite + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
