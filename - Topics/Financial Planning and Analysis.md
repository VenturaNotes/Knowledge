## Source [^1]
- FP&A is a series of practices that aid in improving the understanding of an organization's overall financial status. It consists of planning, budgeting, buying, reporting, and forecasting/modeling. By following these steps, business leaders can get a clear picture of their current expenses as well as those that may arise in the future. This enables them to make informed decisions based on the company's entire financial commitment, rather than just an initial purchase price.
