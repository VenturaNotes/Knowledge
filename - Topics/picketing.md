- A form of industrial action in which employees gather outside a workplace in which there is a trade dispute, usually a strike. The pickets so gathered often form a picket line, past which they attempt to discourage other workers, delivery lorries, and customers' collection lorries from passing. The purpose is to reinforce the effects of the strike and to encourage the maximum number of employees to join it. The right to peaceful picketing at one's own place of work is recognized in the Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992. It is not lawful if it has not first been authorized by a ballot of the union involved and if the reason for the action is because the employer involved is employing a non-union employee. Secondary picketing, i.e. picketing other people's place of work is a civil offence under the Act. In particular so-called flying pickets, who join a picket line although they are neither employees of the organization being picketed nor union representatives of employees, have no immunity from civil action.
