- (learning difficulty) delayed or incomplete intellectual development combined with some form of social malfunction, such as educational or occupational failure or inability of individuals to look after themselves. The disability may be classified according to the intelligence quotient (IQ) as mild (IQ 50-70), moderate to severe (IQ 20-50), and profound (IQ less than 20). Mildly disabled people often make a good adjustment to life after special help with education. The moderately and severely disabled usually need much more help and most are permanently dependent on other people, while the profoundly disabled usually need constant attention. There are very many causes of learning disability, including Down's syndrome, autism, inherited metabolic disorders, brain injury, and gross psychological deprivation; some are preventable or treatable. Individuals with learning disability are at greater risk of developing mental illnesses, such as schizophrenia and dementia. Good education alters the course of the disability, and a specialty of psychiatry provides treatment for patients who have a learning disability as well as a mental illness.
