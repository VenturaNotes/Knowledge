- The absence of trade. For any economy autarchy refers to the situation in which there is no internal trade. For an open economy autarchy can also refer to the absence of external trade. The term is also applied to the policy aim of reducing a country's dependence on foreign trade, for example by tariffs and quotas, even when foreign trade cannot be entirely eliminated.
