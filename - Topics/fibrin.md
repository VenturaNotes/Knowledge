## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. the final product of the process of blood coagulation, produced by the action of the enzyme thrombin on a soluble precursor fibrinogen. The product thus formed (fibrin monomer) links up (polymerizes) with similar molecules to give a fibrous meshwork that forms the basis of a blood clot, which seals off the damaged blood vessel.
## Source[^2]
- The insoluble protein that forms fibers at the site of an injury and is the foundation of a blood clot. See BLOOD CLOTTING.
