- n. A term that usually refers to Gödel's first incompleteness theorem, the proposition that, in any formal system rich enough to incorporate arithmetic, it is possible to formulate statements that are true but that cannot be proved within the system. Slightly more precisely, in such a system $S$, there must be a sentence $p$ such that if $S$ is consistent, then neither $p$ nor its negation (not-p) can be proved within $S$. This theorem is a genuine paradox, has far-reaching implications for the foundations of arithmetic and logic, and has (controversially) been used, informally by the Czech-born US philosopher Ernest Nagel (1901-85) and James R(oy) Newman (1907-66) in their book Gödel's Proof (1958), more formally by the British philosopher John R(andolph) Lucas (born 1929) in an article in the journal Philosophy in 1961, and most formally by the mathematical physicist Roger Penrose (born 1931) in his book The Emperor's New Mind (1989) and especially in his later book Shadows of the Mind (1994), to argue against the strong AI position that conscious thought can be explained in terms of computational principles, and also against the weak AI position that conscious thought can be simulated by computational procedures, and in favor of the view that a fundamental difference therefore exists between human and artificial intelligence. Gödel's second incompleteness theorem is the proposition that the consistency of a formal system rich enough to incorporate arithmetic cannot be proved within the system itself. \[Named after the US logician and mathematician Kurt Gödel (1906-78), born in Brno, Austria-Hungary (now in the Czech Republic), who published it in the journal Monatshefte für Mathematik und Physik in 1931]
