- (insider trading) Dealing in company securities with a view to making a profit or avoiding a loss while in possession of price-sensitive information that is not generally known (insider information). Under the UK Companies Securities (Insider Dealing) Act 1985 those who are or have been connected with a company (e.g. the directors, the company secretary, employees, and professional advisers) are prohibited from such dealing on or, in certain circumstances, off the stock exchange if they acquired the information by virtue of their connection and in confidence. The prohibition extends to certain unconnected persons to whom the information has been conveyed. Similar laws on insider dealing now operate in most developed countries.
