- (1) The arrangement of veins (vascular bundles) in a leaf. The leaves of dicotyledons have a central main vein (midrib) with side branches that themselves further subdivide to form a network (net or reticulate venation). The leaves of monocotyledons have parallel veins (parallel venation). 
- (2) The arrangement of the veins in an insect's wing, which is often important in classification.
