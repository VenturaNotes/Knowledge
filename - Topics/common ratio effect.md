- $n$. A famous violation of expected utility theory that seems intuitively appealing to many human decision makers, a typical example being as follows. An urn contains 100 chips numbered 1 to 100. First, you are given a choice between the following pair of options:
	- Option $A$ : A chip is drawn at random from the urn. If it is numbered 1-20, you receive nothing; if it is numbered $21\text{-}100$, you receive $£ 16$.
	- Option B: You receive $£ 10$ with certainty.
		- Now you face a choice between a second pair of options:
	- Option C: A chip is drawn at random from the urn. If it is numbered 1-80, you receive nothing; if it is numbered $81\text{-}100$, you receive $£ 16$.
	- Option $D$ : A chip is drawn at random from the urn. If it is numbered 1-75, you receive nothing; if it is numbered $76\text{-}100$, you receive $£ 10$.
- Many people prefer $B$ to $A$, because it guarantees a substantial payoff without the risk associated with $A$, and many of the same people also prefer $C$ to $D$, because it offers the prospect of a higher payoff than $D$ with only slightly greater risk. But it is easy to show that this pattern of preferences violates expected utility theory. Writing $u(16)$ for the utility of $£ 16$ and $u(10)$ for the utility of $£ 10$, the preference of $B$ over $A$ implies that $.80 \times$ $u(16)<u(10)$, which means that $u(16)<1.25 \times u(10)$. But the preference of $C$ over $D$ implies that $.20 \times u(16)>.25 \times u(10)$, which simplifies to $u(16)>$ $1.25 \times u(10)$, a contradiction. In general, if $x>y>z$ are sums of money, and $p$ and $q$ are non-zero probabilities, then the common ratio effect occurs if a decision maker prefers the prospect $p y+(1-p) y$ to $p x+(1-p) z$, and also prefers $p(1-q) x+(1-p)(1-q) z+q z$ to $p(1-q) y+(1-p)(1-q) y+q z$.
