- n. 
- (1) any of the cone-shaped prominences on teeth, especially the molars and premolars. 
- (2) a pocket or fold of the membrane (endocardium) lining the heart or of the layer of the wall of a vein, several of which form a valve. When the blood flows backwards the cusps fill up and become distended, so closing the valve.
## Source[^2]
- (1) A sharp raised protuberance on the surface of a molar tooth. The cusps of opposing molars (i.e. on opposite jaws) are complementary to each other, which increases the efficiency of grinding food during chewing. 
- (2) A flap forming part of a valve.
