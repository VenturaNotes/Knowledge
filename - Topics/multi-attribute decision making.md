- $n$. Decisions made from sets of alternatives that vary on a number of attributes, aspects, or criteria. Familiar examples include choosing a house by comparing alternatives according to price, location, and number of rooms; selecting a marriage partner by comparing suitors on attributes such as physical attractiveness, intelligence, and sense of humor; and hiring an employee by comparing candidates on various qualifications. According to the standard linear additive valuemaximization model, the decision maker simply weights the attributes according to their perceived importance, then sums the weights, then finally chooses the alternative with the highest aggregate weight; but there is evidence to suggest that human decision makers do not always behave according to this model. Also called multi-attribute choice or multiplecriteria decision making or choice. See elimination by aspects, LEXICOGRAPHIC CHOICE, LEXICOGRAPHIC SEMIORDER. MADM abbrev.
