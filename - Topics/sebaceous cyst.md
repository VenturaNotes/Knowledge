- (1) a pale or flesh-coloured dome-shaped cyst that commonly occurs in adults, especially on the face, neck, or trunk. It is firm, with a central dot, and contains keratin, not sebum; such cysts are therefore more correctly referred to as epidermoid cysts. They are usually removed surgically. 
- (2) a cyst of the sebaceous glands occurring in multiple form in a rare inherited condition, steatocystoma multiplex.
