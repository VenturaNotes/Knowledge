- A basic algorithm in artificial intelligence, in particular when constructing programs to play games such as chess. A tree of possible moves, alternating with possible opponent's moves, is constructed to some depth. Evaluation of the positions at the leaves is then passed back up the tree, choosing always the minimum evaluation for the opponent and the maximum for the program itself. See also COMPUTER CHESS.

- The objective in decision theory of minimizing the maximum loss. See also MAXIMIN.

- $n$. In two-person game theory, a strategy (2) that minimizes the maximum payoff to the co-player. In a two-person zero-sum game, it is equivalent to a maximin strategy, because each player's gains are the co-player's losses.
