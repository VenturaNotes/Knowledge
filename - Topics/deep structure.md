- A notion that is central to transformational grammar's (Chomsky 1965) description of the syntax of natural language. Deep structure is where the predicate$\textemdash$argument relationships are expressed, and both relates the words of a sentence to its meaning and expresses grammatical generalizations. Within the 'standard theory' of transformational grammar the context-free base generates deep structures and a set of transformations that map these to the surface structure. In natural-language processing, sentences can be analyzed by either fully or partially running transformations in reverse.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A representation of a sentence at a fundamental level, with the grammatical relations between its parts explicitly shown, before any of the transformational rules have been applied to produce the surface structure. In a famous example suggested by the US linguist and philosopher (Avram) Noam Chomsky (born 1928), the sentences John is eager to please and John is easy to please have similar surface structures but completely different deep structures, because the first involves John pleasing someone and the second John being pleased by someone.
