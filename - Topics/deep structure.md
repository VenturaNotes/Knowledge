- A notion that is central to transformational grammar's (Chomsky 1965) description of the syntax of natural language. Deep structure is where the predicate$\textemdash$argument relationships are expressed, and both relates the words of a sentence to its meaning and expresses grammatical generalizations. Within the 'standard theory' of transformational grammar the context-free base generates deep structures and a set of transformations that map these to the surface structure. In natural-language processing, sentences can be analyzed by either fully or partially running transformations in reverse.
