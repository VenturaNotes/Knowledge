- $n$. inflammation of the prostate gland. This may be due to bacterial infection and can be either acute or chronic. In acute prostatitis the patient has all the symptoms of a urinary infection, including pain in the perineal area, temperature, and shivering. Treatment is by antibiotic administration. In chronic prostatitis, patients commonly complain of pain in the area between the scrotum and the anus, accompanied by lower urinary tract symptoms. Some of these cases are due to bacterial infection, in which case antibiotics are required. In others, no bacterial infection is demonstrated, although there may be evidence of inflammation. Treatment in these cases involves alpha blockers, anti-inflammatory agents, and occasionally antibiotics. In some men, vigorous prostate massage performed under a general anaesthetic can significantly alleviate symptoms.
