- A person or firm that makes a welcome takeover bid for a company on improved terms to replace an unacceptable and unwelcome bid from a black knight. If a company is the target for a takeover bid from a source of which it does not approve or on terms that it does not find attractive, it will often seek a white knight, whom it sees as a more suitable owner for the company, in the hope that a more attractive bid will be made. Compare GREY KNIGHT.
