- A person or firm that makes a welcome takeover bid for a company on improved terms to replace an unacceptable and unwelcome bid from a black knight. If a company is the target for a takeover bid from a source of which it does not approve or on terms that it does not find attractive, it will often seek a white knight, whom it sees as a more suitable owner for the company, in the hope that a more attractive bid will be made. Compare GREY KNIGHT.
## Source[^2]
- A purchaser for a company, willing to rescue it from an unwanted takeover bid by another buyer. A company threatened with takeover may welcome a competitive bid by a white knight as a means of improving the terms offered by the first bidder, whether or not the alternative bid is ultimately accepted.
