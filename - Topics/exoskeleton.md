- A rigid external covering for the body in certain animals, such as the hard chitinous cuticle of arthropods. An exoskeleton protects and supports the body and provides points of attachment for muscles. The cuticle of arthropods must be shed at intervals to allow growth to occur (see ECDYSIS). Other examples of exoskeletons are the shells of molluscs and the bony plates of tortoises and armadillos. Compare ENDOSKELETON.
