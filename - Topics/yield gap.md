- The difference between the average annual dividend yield on equities and the average annual yield on long-dated fixed-income bonds. Before the 1960s yields obtained from UK equities usually exceeded the yields provided by long-dated UK gilts, reflecting the greater degree of risk involved in an investment in equities. In the 1960s, however, rising equity prices led to falling dividend yields causing a reverse yield gap. This was regarded as acceptable, as equities were seen to provide a better hedge against inflation than fixed-interest securities (i.e. their greater risk element was compensated by the possibility of higher capital gains). The yield from UK equities once more overtook that from bonds in the 2000s.

- The difference between the average dividend yield on equities and the average yield on long-dated government bonds. During periods of stable prices the yield on equities usually needs to be greater to compensate investors for their relative riskiness, so the yield gap is positive. During periods of high inflation the fact that equities are expected to provide capital gains to compensate for inflation, while bonds are not, can lead to a reverse yield gap, with returns on government bonds above those on equities. See also REVERSE YIELD GAP.
