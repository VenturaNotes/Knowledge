- The difference between the average annual dividend yield on equities and the average annual yield on long-dated fixed-income bonds. Before the 1960s yields obtained from UK equities usually exceeded the yields provided by long-dated UK gilts, reflecting the greater degree of risk involved in an investment in equities. In the 1960s, however, rising equity prices led to falling dividend yields causing a reverse yield gap. This was regarded as acceptable, as equities were seen to provide a better hedge against inflation than fixed-interest securities (i.e. their greater risk element was compensated by the possibility of higher capital gains). The yield from UK equities once more overtook that from bonds in the 2000s.
