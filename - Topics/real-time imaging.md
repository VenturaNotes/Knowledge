- the rapid acquisition and manipulation of ultrasound information from a scanning probe by electronic circuits to enable images to be produced on TV screens almost instantaneously. The operator can place the scanning probe accurately on the region of interest in order to observe its structure and appreciate moving structures within it (see Doppler Ultrasound). Using similar techniques, the instantaneous display of other imaging modalities, such as computerized tomography scanning and magnetic resonance imaging, can now be achieved. Realtime imaging is useful in guiding interventional radiology procedures, for example, allowing a needle to be guided accurately as it is passed into the body. It is also useful for observing dynamic physiological activity.
