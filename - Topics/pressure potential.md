- Symbol $\Psi_{\mathrm{p}}$. The component of water potential due to the hydrostatic pressure that is exerted on water in a cell. In turgid plant cells it usually has a positive value as the entry of water causes the protoplast to push against the cell wall (see TURGOR). In xylem cells there is a negative pressure potential, or tension, as a result of transpiration. Water at atmospheric pressure has a pressure potential of zero.
