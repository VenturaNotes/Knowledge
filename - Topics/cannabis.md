- $n$. a recreational drug prepared from the Indian hemp plant (Cannabis sativa), also known as pot, marijuana, hashish, and bhang. Smoked or swallowed, it produces euphoria and affects perception and awareness, particularly of time; high doses may cause hallucinations. In the UK cannabis is currently classified as a class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 (as amended). The medical use of cannabis products for those with 'exceptional clinical need' was legalized in 2018; this has so far been taken to include people with epilepsy and those suffering particularly severe effects from chemotherapy. A particular extract of cannabis containing its principal psychoactive ingredient, tetrahydrocannabinol, had already (2010) been licensed for treating spasticity in patients with multiple sclerosis. See Appendix 12 for a list of street names for illicit drugs.
