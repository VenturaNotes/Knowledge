- Payments to the owners of natural resources such as minerals or oil, made by mine operators. Royalties are so called because the owner is frequently a sovereign, or a state. Royalties are governed by agreements, which may specify them in amounts per unit extracted, or as a percentage of revenue. The term is also used for payments by publishers to authors, and by recording companies to composers.
