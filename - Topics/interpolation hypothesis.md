- A hypothetical account for the emergence of a sporophyte generation during the evolution of vascular plants. It postulates that early plants were exclusively haploid gametophytes. At some point a zygote 'germinated' mitotically instead of meiotically, producing a rudimentary diploid sporophyte. Hence, a sporophyte generation was 'inserted', or interpolated, into the life cycle. The sporophyte evolved to become increasingly elaborate and the more prominent form$\textemdash$as in modern seed plants$\textemdash$while the gametophyte became progressively reduced.
