- (of a transitive binary relation $R$ ) A relation $R^{}$ defined as follows:

  

$$

x R^{} y

$$

  

if there exists a sequence

  

$$

x=x_{0}, x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}=y

$$

  

such that $n>0$ and

  

$$

x_{i} R x_{i+1}, i=0,1,2, \ldots, n-1

$$

  

It follows from the transitivity property that

  

$$

\text { if } x R y \text { then } x R^{} y

$$

  

and that $R$ is a subset of $R^{}$.

[[Reflexive closure]] is similar to transitive closure but includes the possibility that $n=0$. Transitive and reflexive closures play important roles in parsing and compiling techniques and in finding paths in graphs.
