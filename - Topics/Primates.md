- An order of mammals that includes the monkeys, apes, and humans. Primates evolved from arboreal insectivores, known as proto-primates, probably some 55-65 million years ago. Living primates are characterized by thumbs and big toes that are opposable (i.e. capable of facing and touching the other digits), which permits manual dexterity, and forward-facing eyes allowing binocular vision. The brain, particularly the cerebrum, is relatively large and well-developed, accounting for the intelligence and quick reactions of these mammals. The young are usually produced singly and undergo a long period of growth and development to the adult form. See also HOMININ.
