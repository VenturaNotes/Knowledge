- (FOB) An Incoterm denoting an export contract in which the seller pays for sending the goods to the port of shipment and loading them on to the ship. Thereafter all costs and risks are assumed by the buyer. The seller is responsible for arranging export documentation. If the goods are to travel by air or rail the terms FOB Airport or Free On Rail (FOR) are sometimes used, although these are not recognized Incoterms. Compare FREE ALONGSIDE SHIP. See also FREE CARRIER.

- (f.o.b.) A term used to refer to a quoted price for a good that is placed on a ship, lorry, or aeroplane by the seller, ready to leave a country. F.o.b. thus includes costs of production and of transport to the port of embarkation, but does not include the costs of freight and insurance in getting them to their foreign destination. F.o.b. is contrasted with c.i.f. (cost, insurance, and freight), the value of goods on arrival at a foreign port, which includes freight and insurance.
