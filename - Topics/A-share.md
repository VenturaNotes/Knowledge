- An ordinary share in a company which, while it receives the same dividends as other ordinary shares, does not give its holder any voting rights. A-shares are issued to enable the group controlling a company to raise capital from outside without parting with control. Because A-shareholders are excluded from control, these shares generally trade at a lower price than voting ordinary shares in the same company.
