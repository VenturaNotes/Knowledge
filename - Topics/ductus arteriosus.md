- a blood vessel in the fetus connecting the pulmonary artery directly to the ascending aorta, so bypassing the pulmonary circulation. It normally closes after birth. Failure of the ductus to close (patent ductus arteriosus) produces a continuous murmur, and the consequences are similar to those of a septal defect. It may close spontaneously in childhood but often requires surgical closure.
## Source[^2]
- A channel that connects the pulmonary artery with the aorta in the mammalian fetus and therefore allows blood to bypass the inactive lungs of the fetus. Derived from the fifth aortic arch, it normally closes soon after birth.
