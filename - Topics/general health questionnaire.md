- $n$. A self-rating questionnaire that takes between six and eight minutes to fill in and is designed to provide a rough-and-ready screening device for a wide range of mental disorders excluding psychoses (1). It comprises 60 items, each describing a symptom and being accompanied by four response categories indicating personal experience of the symptom (less than usual, no more than usual, rather more than usual, much more than usual) from which the respondent chooses one. Shorter versions containing 20, 28, and 30 items have also been constructed. It was developed by the English psychiatrist David (Paul Brandes) Goldberg (born 1934) and published initially in monograph form in 1972; this was followed by a co-authored article in the journal Psychological Medicine in 1979 describing a scaled version of the questionnaire.
