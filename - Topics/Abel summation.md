- A method of computing the sum of a possibly divergent series of complex numbers $\{a_k\}$ as the limit, as $z$ approaches 1 from below, of the power series $\sum(a_kz^k)$, assuming the series $\{a_k\}$ has radius of convergence = 1. Abel summation is consistent with, and more general than, Ces√†ro summation.
