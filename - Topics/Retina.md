- $n$. the light-sensitive layer that lines the interior of the eye. The outer part of the retina (retinal pigment epithelium; RPE), next to the choroid, is pigmented to prevent the passage of light. The inner part, next to the cavity of the eyeball, contains rods and cones (light-sensitive cells) and their associated nerve fibres (see illustration). A large number of cones is concentrated in a depression in the retina at the back of the eyeball called the fovea. $\textemdash$retinal adj.
