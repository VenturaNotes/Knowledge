- $n$. the light-sensitive layer that lines the interior of the eye. The outer part of the retina (retinal pigment epithelium; RPE), next to the choroid, is pigmented to prevent the passage of light. The inner part, next to the cavity of the eyeball, contains rods and cones (light-sensitive cells) and their associated nerve fibers (see illustration). A large number of cones is concentrated in a depression in the retina at the back of the eyeball called the fovea. $\textemdash$retinal adj.

## Source[^3]
- (pl. retinas or retinae) The light-sensitive membrane that lines the interior of the eye. The retina consists of two layers. The outer layer (pigment epithelium) is pigmented, which prevents the back reflection of light and consequent decrease in visual acuity. The inner layer contains nerve cells, blood vessels, and two types of light-sensitive cells (rods and cones). Light passing through the lens stimulates individual rods and cones, which generates nerve impulses that are transmitted through bipolar and ganglion cells to the optic nerve, and hence to the brain, where the visual image is formed. Information can also be transferred horizontally within the retina via a network of horizontal and amacrine cells (see illustration). The retinal neurons are supported by glia called MÃ¼ller cells.
