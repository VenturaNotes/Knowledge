- An official document that must be submitted to the Registrar of Companies when a new company is formed.
- Until 1 October 2010, when the Companies Act 2006 came into force, the memorandum formed part of the company's constitution and included such information as the objects of the company, the type of company (e.g. public limited company), and the authorized share capital. The memorandum is now a much shorter document stating simply that the members wish to form a company. See also ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION.
