## Synthesis
- Refers to how strictly a programming language enforces type rules
	- #question What are type rules?
- In a strongly typed language
	- Every variable and expression has a specific type
		- #question What is the difference between a variable and expression in programming?
	- Can't perform operations on mismatched types without explicit conversion
- Characteristics of Strong Typing
	- Type Safety: Operations involving different types require explicit conversions (adding string to a number)
## Source [^1]
- A feature of some programming languages that requires the type of each data item to be declared, precludes the application of operators to inappropriate data types, and prevents the interaction of incompatible types.
