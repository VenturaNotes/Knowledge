- In chartist analysis, a movement in the market price of a security above or below the limits within which it has recently fluctuated. When a security's price moves to a level above the usual price ceiling or below the usual price floor, this is thought to herald a continuing move in the same direction. See also RESISTANCE LEVEL.
