## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- This is a value function, or a configuration of pay-offs, in a cooperative game that minimizes the maximum dissatisfaction of every possible coalition. Dissatisfaction is measured by the 'excess' which is the difference between the potential pay-off of a coalition and the sum of the individual pay-offs to that coalition's members for a given proposed allocation.

- n. (pl. nucleoli) a dense spherical structure within the cell nucleus that disappears during cell division. The nucleolus contains RNA for the synthesis of ribosomes and plays an important part in RNA and protein synthesis.
## Source[^3]
- (pl. nucleoli) A small dense round body within the nucleus of a nondividing eukaryotic cell that is the site of ribosome assembly. It forms around the nucleolar organizer, which encodes most of the segments of ribosomal RNA. Ribosomal proteins migrate to the nucleolus from their assembly sites in the cytoplasm and are packaged into ribonucleoproteins, which then return to the cytoplasm where they become mature ribosome particles. Two or more nucleoli may be present, depending on the species of organism and stage of the cell cycle.
