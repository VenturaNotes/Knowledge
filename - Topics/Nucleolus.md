- This is a value function, or a configuration of pay-offs, in a cooperative game that minimizes the maximum dissatisfaction of every possible coalition. Dissatisfaction is measured by the 'excess' which is the difference between the potential pay-off of a coalition and the sum of the individual pay-offs to that coalition's members for a given proposed allocation.
