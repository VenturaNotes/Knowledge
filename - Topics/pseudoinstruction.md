- pseudoinstruction (pseudo-operation, directive) An element in an assembly language that is similar to an instruction but provides control information to the assembler as opposed to generating a particular instruction. Examples are:
	- generate absolute code/generate relative addresses;
	- start a new segment;
	- allocate space for constants or variables.
