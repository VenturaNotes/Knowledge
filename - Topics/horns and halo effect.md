- An effect in which one person's judgment of another is unduly influenced by a first impression; it may be either unfavorable (horns) or favorable (halo). The effects can be misleading when interviewing job applicants. For example, a well-qualified candidate who arrives late for an interview, for a good reason, may be passed over as a bad timekeeper, while a poorly qualified but punctual and well-groomed candidate may be offered the job.
