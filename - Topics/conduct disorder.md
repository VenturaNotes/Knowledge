- a repetitive and persistent pattern of aggressive or otherwise antisocial behavior. It is usually recognized in childhood or adolescence and may include such behaviors as unusually frequent and severe temper tantrums, arguing with adults, defying rules, being angry and resentful, cruelty to animals, lying or breaking promises, use of weapons, sexual aggression, destroying property, truancy, bullying, and general delinquency. It can lead to antisocial personality disorder. Treatment is usually with behavior therapy or family therapy, although there is some debate as to whether it should be seen as a social rather than a medical problem.
