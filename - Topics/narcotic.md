- $n$. a drug that induces stupor and insensibility and relieves pain. Now largely obsolete in medical contexts, the term was used particularly for morphine and other derivatives of opium (see OPIATE) but also referred to other drugs that depress brain function (e.g. general anaesthetics and hypnotics). In legal terms a narcotic is any addictive drug subject to illegal use.
