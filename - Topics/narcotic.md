- $n$. a drug that induces stupor and insensibility and relieves pain. Now largely obsolete in medical contexts, the term was used particularly for morphine and other derivatives of opium (see OPIATE) but also referred to other drugs that depress brain function (e.g. general anaesthetics and hypnotics). In legal terms a narcotic is any addictive drug subject to illegal use.

- adj. n. (Of or relating to) a class of drugs that produce narcosis, or at least drowsiness, torpor, and numbness, and are sometimes prescribed medicinally as analgesics (1), anaesthetics (1), or hypnotics (2) and sometimes taken as street drugs, high dosages leading to depressed respiration, convulsions, coma, and death, and prolonged use often resulting in addiction or dependence (2). The word is often misapplied, even by government agencies, to addictive drugs in general, excluding alcohol but including stimulant drugs such as cocaine or amphetamine, or to illegal drugs in general, including cannabis and LSD, whether or not they have narcotic or depressant effects, but such abuses of language are avoided in careful usage.
