These include administering the NHS pension scheme, issuing European Health Insurance Cards to UK residents, and issuing penalty charge notices to patients who falsely claim to be exempt from paying prescription charges. NHSBSA also hosts NHS Prescription Services, which provides pharmacies with reimbursement for items supplied under NHS prescriptions.
