- an extra electrical conduction pathway between the atria and ventricles, anatomically separate from the atrioventricular node, that predisposes to re-entry tachycardia. The pathway conducts faster than the atrioventricular node, giving rise to pre-excitation recognized by a characteristic delta wave at the beginning of the QRS complex on the electrocardiogram in normal rhythm. The presence of this pathway, with the occurrence of intermittent tachycardias, is known as the Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.
