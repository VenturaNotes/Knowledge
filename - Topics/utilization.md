- (system utilization) The ratio of the actual output of an operating system to its designed capacity. For example, if the designed capacity of a plant is 4,000 units per week and the output is 3,000 units per week, the utilization is $75 \%$. However, it is important to remember that $75 \%$ represents the utilization of the most restricted part of the operating system, i.e. the bottleneck. If other parts of the plant are capable of more than 4,000 units per week their utilization will be lower.
