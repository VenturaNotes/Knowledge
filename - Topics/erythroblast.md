- $n$. any of a series of nucleated cells (see NORMOBLAST; PROERYTHROBLAST) that pass through a succession of stages of maturation to form red blood cells (erythrocytes). Erythroblasts are normally present in the blood-forming tissue of the bone marrow, but they may appear in the circulation in a variety of diseases (see ERYTHROBLASTOSIS). See also ERYTHROPOIESIS.
## Source[^2]
- Any of the cells in the myeloid tissue of red bone marrow that develop into erythrocytes (red blood cells). Erythroblasts have a nucleus and are at first colorless, but fill with haemoglobin as they develop. In mammals the nucleus disappears. See ERYTHROPOIESIS.
