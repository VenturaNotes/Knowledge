- An algebra formed by removing some of the operations, and possibly carriers, of another algebra. Let $A$ be an algebra of signature $\Sigma_{0}$ and let $\Sigma$ be a subsignature of $\Sigma_{0}$. Then the reduct $A\mid_\Sigma$ of $A$ with respect to $\Sigma$ is the algebra formed by removing from $A$ the carriers, constants, and operations of $A$ not named in $\Sigma$.
