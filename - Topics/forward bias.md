- The d.c. voltage required to maintain current flow in a bipolar transistor or diode or to enhance current flow in a field-effect transistor. For example, a silicon diode will conduct current only if its anode is at a positive voltage compared to its cathode; it is then said to be forward biased. This voltage will be approximately 0.6 volts. Compare REVERSE BIAS.
