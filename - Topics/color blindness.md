- any of various conditions in which certain colors are confused with one another. True lack of color appreciation is extremely rare (see MONOCHROMAT), but some defect of color discrimination is present in about $8 \%$ of Caucasian males, and $0.4 \%$ of Caucasian females. The most common type of color blindness is Daltonism (protanopia) -red-blindness $\textendash$ in which the person cannot distinguish between reds and greens. Occasional cases are due to acquired disease of the retina but in the vast majority it is inherited. The defect is thought to be in the functioning of the light-sensitive cells in the retina responsible for color perception (see CONE). See also DEUTERANOPIA; TRICHROMATIC.

- Any disorder of vision in which colors are confused. The most common type is red-green color blindness. This is due to a recessive gene carried on the X chromosome (see SEX LINKAGE), and therefore men are more likely to show the defect although women may be carriers. It results in absence or malfunctioning of one or more of the three types of cone cell responsible for colour vision. In protanopia the individual lacks cones sensitive to red light; in deuteranopia cones sensitive to green light are absent. Tritanopia is a rare form of colour blindness in which the individual cannot distinguish between blue and green due to a lack of cones sensitive to blue light.
