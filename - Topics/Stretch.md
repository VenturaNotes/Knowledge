- A monster computer chartered by the US Government and built in the late 1950s by IBM as its IBM 7030; it was designed to ‘stretch the technique of computer building to its limits’. It had a pipelined instruction unit with address lookahead, and a 64-bit word length with double precision arithmetic if required. Addressing was down to the bit over a two-million word memory. It was capable of variable word length working and, in fact, almost anything that could be expected of hardware. A limited number of 7030s were built for atomic energy and similar research establishments.
