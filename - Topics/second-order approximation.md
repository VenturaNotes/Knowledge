- Approximation of an arbitrary function by its expansion in a Taylor's series keeping only linear and quadratic terms and assuming that the terms of the higher order are negligible. It is used, for example, in models of individual choice under uncertainty to capture risk aversion, or in welfare models to capture the effect of income distribution. See also LINEAR APPROXIMATION.
