- Paid social is a practice used in marketing and advertising where paid ads or sponsored content are displayed on social media platforms. The goal is to reach a specific audience to promote a product or service, or to raise brand awareness. Typically, paid social uses a cost-per-click (CPC) payment method where those who create the ads are charged for the advertisement based on how many clicks it generates.
