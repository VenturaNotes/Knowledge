- a medical specialty in which radionuclides (especially technetium-99m) are used as tracers to study the structure and function of organs of the body. The radionuclide is attached to a compound suitable for the particular test and then injected, inhaled, or ingested. When concentrated in the organ under investigation, the tracer can be imaged using a gamma camera, revealing the structure or demonstrating the function of the organ. Alternatively, blood or urine samples may be analyzed. See also NUCLEAR CARDIOLOGY.
