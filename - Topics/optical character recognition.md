- (OCR) The recognition of printed characters by a light-sensitive optical scanner. The scanner recognizes the shape of a letter by scanning it with a very fine point of light. It then uses a computer to compare the pattern of reflected light with the patterns of the letters of the alphabet stored in its memory. OCR is often used to read responses on questionnaires, thus reducing human error and increasing the speed of analysis.
