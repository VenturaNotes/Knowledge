- Any of various types of cheap memory device, normally produced in integrated circuit form, that are used for storing binary data patterns in digital electronic circuits. They consist internally of arrays of latches constructed of semiconductor devices such as bipolar transistors or MOSFETs. The memory capacity of a single chip is increasing by a factor of four every few years. See also DIMM.
- Solid-state memory is another name for semiconductor memory
