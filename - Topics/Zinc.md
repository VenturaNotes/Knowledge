- $n$. a trace element that is a cofactor of many enzymes: it is important in the immune response and has structural properties in some proteins. Deficiency is rare with a balanced diet but may occur in alcoholics and those with kidney disease; symptoms include lesions of the skin, oesophagus, and cornea, alopecia, and (in children) retarded growth. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is $9.5 ~\mu \mathrm{g} /$day for men and $7.0 ~\mu \mathrm{g} /$day for women (an additional $6 ~\mu \mathrm{g}$ is needed during lactation). Symbol: Zn.
## Source[^2]
- Symbol Zn. A blue-white metallic element that is a trace element (see ESSENTIAL ELEMENT) required by living organisms. It functions as the prosthetic group of a number of enzymes and in plants is required for auxin production. Certain plant species can accumulate very high concentrations, and flourish on land heavily contaminated with zinc (see HYPERACCUMULATOR).
