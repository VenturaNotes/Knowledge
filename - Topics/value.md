- (1) Value $=$ price $\times$ quantity. For example, if between two years prices quadruple and quantities in the economy increase by 25 per cent, the money value of gross domestic product rises to $4 \times 1.25=5$ times its former level.
- (2) A synonym for price. The theory of value is concerned with explaining the relative prices of goods.
- (3) A general term of praise, used in a phrase such as 'good value'. Value in this sense refers to something similar to price but more important and more permanent. Advertisers claim that their goods represent 'value for money'; politicians claim the same for their policies.
- (4) The magnitude of a variable or parameter.
