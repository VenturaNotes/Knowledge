- The geometric mean of the base-weighted or Laspeyres index and the current-weighted index (Paasche index) for the same period. Irving Fisher (1867-1947), an American economist, labelled it as ideal because it has the property of consistency across two periods: if the value of the index between periods $s$ and $t$ is $I_{s t}$ then the value of the index in the reverse direction from $t$ to $s$ satisfies $I_{t s}=1 / I_{s t}$. See also DROBISCH PRICE INDEX.
