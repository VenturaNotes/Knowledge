- An electronic logic gate whose output is logic 1 (true) only when all (two or more) inputs are logic 1 , otherwise it is logic 0 (false). It therefore implements the logical AND operation on its inputs and has the same truth table. The diagram shows the usual circuit symbol and the truth table of a two-input gate.
