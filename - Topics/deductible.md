- The amount deducted from a claim in an excess policy; whereas 'excess' is the usual word in motor-vehicle and householders' policies, 'deductible' is used in large commercial insurances. It is an amount that is deducted from every claim that is paid. If a claim is made for a figure below the deductible no payment is made. Deductibles are usually applied to policies in return for a premium reduction.
