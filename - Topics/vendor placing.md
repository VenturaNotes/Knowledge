- A type of placing used as a means of acquiring another company or business. For example, if company X wishes to buy a business from company Y , it issues company X shares to company Y as payment with the prearranged agreement that these shares are then placed with investors in exchange for cash. Vendor placings have been popular with companies in recent years as a cheaper alternative to a rights issue. See also BOUGHT DEAL.
