- $n$. a rhythmical and alternating movement that may affect any part of the body. The physiological tremor is a feature of the normal mechanism for maintaining posture. It may be more apparent in states of fatigue or anxiety or when the thyroid gland is overactive. Essential tremor is slower and particularly affects the hands and arms when held out or holding a teacup. It can be embarrassing and inconvenient but it is not accompanied by any other symptoms. A similar tremor may also occur in several members of one family and also in elderly people. Alcohol reduces the intensity of essential tremor. Treatment is with beta blockers, such as propanolol. Primary orthostatic tremor affects the legs when standing still, causing unsteadiness if the position is maintained. Resting tremor is a prominent symptom of parkinsonism. An intention tremor occurs when a patient with disease of the cerebellum tries to touch an object. The closer the object is approached the wilder become the movements.
