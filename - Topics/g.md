- abbrev. General factor of ability or intelligence, a concept first proposed in an article by the English psychologist Charles Edward Spearman (1863-1945) in the American Journal of Psychology in 1904 on the basis of factor analysis to explain the correlations between scores on diverse intelligence tests and subtests. Spearman interpreted it as mental energy, but others reinterpreted it as abstract reasoning ability or as neural processing speed, and some, starting in 1916 with the English psychologist Godfrey H(ilton) (later Sir Godfrey) Thomson (1881-1955), viewed it as a mere statistical abstraction devoid of psychological meaning. Also called general ability. See also factorial VALidity. Compare primary mental abilities.
