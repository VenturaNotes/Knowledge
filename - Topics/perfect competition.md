- A market in which no buyer or seller has the power to influence prices, which result solely from an equilibrium of supply and demand. For such a market to exist there would have to be a multiplicity of small buyers and sellers, no barriers to entry, and a state of perfect information about prices; moreover, the goods offered by the various sellers would have to be undifferentiated to prevent the development of monopolistic competition. The idea of pure competition is mainly useful as a tool for analyzing the ways in which real-world markets diverge from such a model. Probably, no such market has ever truly existed: the nearest approximations would be certain markets for agricultural products and some types of competitive auction (including online auctions).

- An idealized market situation in which all information is known to all market participants, and both buyers and sellers are so numerous that each is a price-taker, able to buy or sell any desired quantity without affecting the market price. It was once thought that these were the assumptions necessary to describe a competitive economy. This is not the case. Provided all market participants have symmetric information (but not necessarily complete information) and act as if they were price-takers, the competitive equilibrium will emerge.
