- a congenital heart disorder in which the left side of the heart, particularly the left ventricle, is underdeveloped. The first part of the aorta may also be abnormal. Affected babies usually develop severe heart failure within the first few days of life. Diagnosis can be confirmed on echocardiography. Prognosis is generally very poor $\textendash$ most babies die within the first few weeks $\textendash$ but milder cases may be amenable to surgery. It is the commonest cause of death in the neonatal period due to heart disease.
