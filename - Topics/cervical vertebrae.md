- the seven bones making up the neck region of the backbone. The first cervical vertebra - the atlas - consists basically of a ring of bone that supports the skull by articulating with the occipital condyles (see OCCIPITAL BONE). The second vertebra $\textendash$ the axis $\textendash$ has an upward-pointing process (the odontoid process or dens) that forms a pivot on which the atlas can rotate, enabling the head to be turned. See also VERTEBRA.
