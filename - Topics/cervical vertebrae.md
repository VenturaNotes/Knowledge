- the seven bones making up the neck region of the backbone. The first cervical vertebra - the atlas - consists basically of a ring of bone that supports the skull by articulating with the occipital condyles (see OCCIPITAL BONE). The second vertebra $\textendash$ the axis $\textendash$ has an upward-pointing process (the odontoid process or dens) that forms a pivot on which the atlas can rotate, enabling the head to be turned. See also VERTEBRA.

- The vertebrae of the neck. The number of cervical vertebrae varies: for example, most mammals (including humans) have 7. Their main functions are to support the head and to provide articulating surfaces against which it can move relative to the backbone. See atlas; AXIS.
