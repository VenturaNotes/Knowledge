- X-ray crystallography that is carried out at low temperatures of about 100 K. At such temperatures the atoms in a crystal vibrate less, meaning that the intensities of the X-ray diffraction spots are greater. This, in turn, means that the crystal structures can be determined at higher resolution than at room temperature. Cryocrystallography is particularly useful in studying molecules of biological interest, as such molecules are frequently destroyed rapidly by beams of X-rays at room temperature.
