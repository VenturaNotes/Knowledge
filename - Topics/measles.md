- $n$. a highly infectious virus disease that tends to appear in epidemics every 2-3 years and mainly affects children. After an incubation period of $8-15$ days, symptoms resembling those of a cold develop accompanied by a high fever. Small red spots with white centers (Koplik's spots) may appear on the inside of the cheeks. On the third to fifth day a blotchy slightly elevated pink rash develops, first behind the ears then on the face and elsewhere; it lasts 3-5 days. The patient is infectious throughout this period. In most cases the symptoms soon subside but patients are susceptible to pneumonia and middle ear infections. Complete recovery may take 2-4 weeks. Severe complications include encephalitis (one in 1000 cases) and subacute sclerosing panencephalitis. Measles is a common cause of childhood mortality in malnourished children, particularly in the developing world. Vaccination against measles provides effective immunity (see MMR VACCINE). Medical names: rubeola, morbilli.
