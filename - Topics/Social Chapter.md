- The section of the founding treaty of the European Union that reflects the agreement of member states with respect to social policy. The objectives of the Social Chapter are to promote employment, improve living and working conditions, establish dialogue between management and workers by means of works councils, implement proper social protection, and develop human resources with a view to lasting high employment. After much resistance, the British government finally agreed to the incorporation of these social aims and objectives into the main body of the treaty in 1997. This has led to a number of changes to UK law, including the implementation of unpaid parental leave and new rights for part-time workers (who are now entitled to be treated no less favorably than comparable full-time workers in their contractual terms and conditions).
