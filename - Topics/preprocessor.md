- Prepares source code for compiler proper
- Example in C/C++
	- Consumes all directives starting with # symbol
		- The \#include directive causes preprocessor to open named file and insert its contents into source code
		- A \#define directive causes preprocessor to substitute a value when a macro name is encountered

## Source[^2]
- A program that performs modifications to data in order to make it suitable for input to another program, especially a compiler. The modifications may be simple changes of format, or may include macro expansions.
