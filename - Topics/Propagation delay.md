## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- The time it takes for a signal to travel from one point to another in a communication system

## Source[^2]
- The amount of time required for a signal to be received after it has been sent
	- It is caused by the time it takes for the [[signal]] to travel through a [[medium]]

## Source[^3]
- The time required for a change in the input to a logic gate or logic circuit to produce a change in the output. It is usually very brief. It is inherent in any gate or circuit, being caused by unavoidable delays in transistor switching and propagation of electric signals through passive components.
