- A surface of constant energy in the reciprocal lattice of a crystal, with this energy being the energy of the Fermi level. In the case of free electrons, the Fermi surface is the surface of a sphere. However, the Fermi surface is generally much more complicated and will depend on the crystal lattice. The Fermi surface determines the electrical, magnetic, and thermal properties of metals. Fermi surfaces can be investigated experimentally in several ways.
