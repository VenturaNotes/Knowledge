- Digital rights management (DRM) is a systematic approach to protecting digital media copyrights. DRM uses technology and takes measures to control and manage access to digital copyrighted material. DRM aims to prevent unauthorized redistribution and restricts the ways consumers can copy purchased content by embedding codes in the digital content that prevent duplicating and specify the duration content can be accessed, as well as limiting the number of devices on which the media can be retrieved.
