- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a neurosis with a phobia as its central symptom. The term was introduced in 1908 by the Austrian psychiatrist Wilhelm Stekel (1868-1940) in his book Nervöse Angstzustände und ihre Behandlung (Neurotic Anxiety States and their Treatment) specifically to emphasize its structural resemblance to conversion hysteria (now called dissociative disorder). See also TRANSFERENCE NEUROSIS (1).
