- A market of the London Stock Exchange that opened in June 1995 to replace the Unlisted Securities Market, with the object of allowing small growing companies to raise capital and have their shares traded in a market, without the expense of a full market listing. Since its formation nearly 3000 smaller companies have traded their shares on this market and the number of institutions investing in the market is increasing.
