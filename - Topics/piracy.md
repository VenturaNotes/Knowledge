- (1) An illegal act of violence, detention, robbery, or revenge committed on a ship or aircraft. It excludes acts committed for political purposes and during a war. In marine insurance it extends to include any form of plundering at sea. 
- (2) Infringement of copyright. The usual remedy is for the copyright holder to obtain an injunction to end the infringement. This may not be possible in a foreign country and many British and American books are pirated in foreign countries by copying them photographically and printing them cheaply.
