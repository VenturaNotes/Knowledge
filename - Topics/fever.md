- (pyrexia) $n$. a rise in body temperature above the normal, i.e. above an oral temperature of $98.6^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(37^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ or a rectal temperature of $99^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ $\left(37.2^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$. Fever is generally accompanied by shivering, headache, nausea, constipation, or diarrhoea. A rise in temperature above $105^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\left(40.5^{\circ} \mathrm{C}\right)$ may cause delirium and, in young children, convulsions too. Fevers are usually caused by bacterial or viral infections and can accompany any infectious illness, from the common cold to malaria. An intermittent fever is a periodic rise and fall in body temperature, often returning to normal during the day and reaching its peak at night, as in malaria. A remittent fever is one in which body temperature fluctuates but does not return to normal. See also RELAPSING FEVER.
