- imaging of the bile duct and pancreatic duct. A catheter is carefully manipulated into the ducts via direct puncture through the abdomen under radiological guidance. Contrast material is flushed through the catheter to delineate the ducts (see also CHOLANGIOGRAPHY). This procedure is often performed in cases of obstructive jaundice prior to insertion of a biliary drain or stent when ERCP is not possible.
