- $n$. a radioactive metallic element that emits alpha and gamma rays during its decay into other elements. The gamma radiation was formerly employed in radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Because radon, a radioactive gas, is released from radium, the metal was enclosed in gas-tight containers during use. Radium is stored in lead-lined containers, which give protection from the radiation. Symbol: Ra.
