- (1) (resistor-transistor logic) An early logic family, usually produced in integrated-circuit form, whose principal component parts consist of integrated resistors and bipolar transistors. Despite its low power dissipation, RTL is now little used since it has a relatively slow switching speed and small fan-out. 
- (2) Abbrev. for register transfer language.
