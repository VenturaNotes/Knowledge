- The background illumination applied to all objects in a scene. The lighting model assumes an imaginary light hits each point of every object in the scene with the same colour and intensity. Ambient light approximates the overall diffuse interreflections in the scene. Ambient light does not need to be specified if the lighting model takes account of the diffuse reflection of light between surfaces.
