- A virtual local area network (VLAN) is used to logically group or segment systems within a single LAN, letting them communicate as if they were on a separate LAN.Â This setup happens by using a router to segment the network or by using switches that support the creation of VLANs, allowing multiple devices to be grouped and treated as if they were all on the same network.
