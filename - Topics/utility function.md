- A mathematical equation used in economics to represent a consumer's preferences for different goods and services

## Source[^2]
- In economics, the utility function measures the welfare or satisfaction of a consumer as a function of the consumption of real goods, such as food or clothing
- This function is widely used in [[rational choice theory]] to analyze human behavior
- Utility function is essentially a "model" used to represent consumer preferences, so companies often implement them to gain an edge over the competition
	- Example: Studying consumers' utility can help guide management on anything from marketing and sales to product upgrades and new offerings
### Calculating Utility Function
- Utility functions are expressed as a function of the quantities of a bundle of goods or services
	- Often denoted as $U(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_n)$ 
- A utility function that describes a preference for one bundle of goods $(X_a)$ vs another bundle of goods $(X_b)$ is expressed as
	- $U(X_a, X_b)$ 
- When there are perfect complements, the utility function is written as $U(X_a,X_b) = MIN[X_a,X_b]$  where the smaller of the two as assigned the function's value
- In certain situations, the goods may be considered perfect substitutes for each other, and the appropriate utility function must reflect such preferences with a utility form of $U(X_a,X_b) = X_a + X_b$
