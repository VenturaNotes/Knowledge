## Synthesis
- A mathematical equation used in economics to represent a consumer's preferences for different goods and services
## Source[^1]
- In economics, the utility function measures the welfare or satisfaction of a consumer as a function of the consumption of real goods, such as food or clothing
- This function is widely used in [[rational choice theory]] to analyze human behavior
- Utility function is essentially a "model" used to represent consumer preferences, so companies often implement them to gain an edge over the competition
	- Example: Studying consumers' utility can help guide management on anything from marketing and sales to product upgrades and new offerings
### Calculating Utility Function
- Utility functions are expressed as a function of the quantities of a bundle of goods or services
	- Often denoted as $U(X_1, X_2, X_3, X_n)$ 
- A utility function that describes a preference for one bundle of goods $(X_a)$ vs another bundle of goods $(X_b)$ is expressed as
	- $U(X_a, X_b)$ 
- When there are perfect complements, the utility function is written as $U(X_a,X_b) = MIN[X_a,X_b]$  where the smaller of the two as assigned the function's value
- In certain situations, the goods may be considered perfect substitutes for each other, and the appropriate utility function must reflect such preferences with a utility form of $U(X_a,X_b) = X_a + X_b$ 
## Source[^2]
- A function that can either be the actual evaluation of an individual's utility or an economist's convenient representation of an individual's preferences. There is in principle no reason why an individual cannot evaluate the utility of different outcomes using a utility function. If they do, then the first interpretation applies. Note that 'an individual' can be broadly interpreted to include organizations, and an organization may employ a utility function to guide its decision-making. Economists employ utility functions as a convenient representation of preferences that permits mathematical analysis. A utility function represents a set of preferences if the function has a higher value for consumption bundle $x$ than for consumption bundle $y$ if, and only if, $x$ is preferred to $y$. The restrictions that must be placed on preferences to ensure a utility function exists that represents them are very weak. Moreover, a rational individual will act as if they maximize the utility function. See also INDIRECT UTILITY FUNCTION; SEPARABLE UTILITY FUNCTION.
