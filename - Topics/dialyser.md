- (dialyzer) n. a medical device designed to allow controllable transfer of solutes and water across a semipermeable membrane separating blood and dialysate solutions flowing countercurrent to each other. Most modern dialysers are based on hollow-fibre technology and are tubeshaped. Blood enters the top of the tube and travels, by capillary action, down a large number of hollow microfibres, which are embedded in polyurethane at each end of the dialyser tube for support. Dialysate enters the tube from the side, near the bottom of the tube. It runs in the opposite direction to the blood, around the hollow fibres and separated from the blood by the semipermeable membrane that constitutes the microfibre wall. A number of different dialyser membranes are in use, displaying a wide variety of permeabilities (related to pore size), biocompatibilities (not activating cytokine or alternate pathway complement responses in the blood), and costs.
