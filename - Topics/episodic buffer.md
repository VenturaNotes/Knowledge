- $n$. A third buffer store added to the working memory model by the English psychologist Alan (David) Baddeley (born 1934) in articles in the journals Trends in Cognitive Sciences (2000), American Psychologist (2001), and Behavioral and Brain Sciences (2001). It was intended to solve the problem of integrating items of information from the various subsystems of working memory and from long-term memory to enable their active maintenance and manipulation. It is assumed to be a limited-capacity buffer store capable of holding integrated scenes or episodes coded in multiple modalities, including especially visual and auditory codes. See also ePISODIC MEMORY.
