- The effective continuous noise power, the addition of which to a continuous signal has the same effect as the amplitude quantization to which the signal is subjected (see DisCrete and CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS). The effect of time quantization may also be described by the addition of noise, but in a more complex way. See also NyQUIST'S CRITERION.
