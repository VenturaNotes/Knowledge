- Penetration testing is an information security test in which an attacker attempts to gain unauthorized access to a system or network. The tester's goal may be any number of things: gathering intelligence, stealing data, disrupting operations, etc. Penetration testers are often hired by businesses to identify weaknesses that malicious actors might exploit so they can fix those vulnerabilities.
