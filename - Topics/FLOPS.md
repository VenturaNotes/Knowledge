- (floating-point operations per second) A commonly used measure of computer power for very powerful computers (supercomputers, vector processing computers) and array processors. The rating of a computer, which in very powerful machines is measured in tens of petaflops (i.e. tens of thousands of billions of flops), must be qualified by a statement of the precision to which the operations are carried out.
