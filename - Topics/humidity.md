- The concentration of water vapor in the atmosphere. The absolute humidity is the mass of water vapor per unit volume of air, usually expressed in $\mathrm{kg}~ \mathrm{m}^{-3}$. A useful measure is the relative humidity, the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the moisture in the air to the moisture it would contain if it were saturated at the same temperature and pressure.
