- (float) The difference between the amount of time an activity takes and the amount of time allocated to it in network modelling. Activities that constitute the critical path in a project are those for which there is no slack time. Activities not on the critical path have an earliest and a latest possible start and finish time. The difference between the two is the slack time.
