- A form of price discrimination in which different units of a product are sold at different prices. A discount for buying in bulk is an example of second-degree price discrimination. Another form of second-degree price discrimination is commoditybundling. Two products (such as a computer and the operating system) can be sold separately or as a bundle. Selling the bundle for less than the sum of prices of the two products is second-degree price discrimination. The benefit of bundling for the seller is that it may attract additional consumers who would not have purchased the separate products. See also FIRST-DEGREE PRICE DISCRIMINATION; THIRD-DEGREE PRICE DISCRIMINATION.
