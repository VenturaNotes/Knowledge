## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A molecule resulting from the oxidation reaction between the sulphydryl (-SH) groups of two cysteine molecules (see Amino aciD). This often occurs between adjacent cysteine residues in polypeptides. The resultant disulphide bridges ($\textendash\mathrm{S}\textendash\mathrm{S}\textendash$) are important in stabilizing the structure of protein molecules.
