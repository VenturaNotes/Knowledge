- Workers employed for low pay and often for long hours under poor working conditions. In many poor countries this is true of almost everybody who is employed at all. In more advanced countries, where such treatment is exceptional, workers treated in this way are often separated from the main labour markets by factors such as poor education and language differences, and sometimes by their status as illegal immigrants.
