- Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) is a server-to-server protocol that sends emails between email servers. It doesn't retrieve emails from a server. There are a few considerations to keep in mind with SMTP. It only supports text, not attachments such as PDFs or Word documents. SMTP also only supports negative delivery notifications (when an email is not delivered to a recipient), not positive delivery notifications (when an email is delivered). Because of this, SMTP doesn't comply with electronic data interchange (EDI), the standard for exchanging information over the internet.
