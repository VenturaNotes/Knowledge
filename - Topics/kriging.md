- A statistical technique for interpolating between points in space, developed originally in the mining industry for locating profitable minerals. The analysis involves modelling the relationship between deviations from the trend at neighbouring points in space in order to find the best predictor at any point that was not sampled. The covariance function may depend both on distance and on orientation.
