- (TNF) either of two proteins, TNF-$\alpha$ or TNF- $\beta$, that function as cytokines. Produced by macrophages, monocytes, T lymphocytes, and various other cells, they mediate many responses, including inflammation, and have a marked action against tumor cells. Anti-TNF drugs (see CYTOKINE INHIBITOR) are used in the treatment of several disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
## Source[^2]
- (TNF) Either of two proteins that act as cytokines, eliciting numerous responses in virtually all types of cells by activating cellular signaling pathways and promoting the expression of genes. They are involved in many aspects of the body's immune defences, notably in their ability to destroy tumor cells; they also assist in the killing of virally infected cells by natural killer cells. TNF-$\alpha$ is a glycoprotein produced chiefly by monocytes and macrophages, whereas TNF-$\beta$ (or lymphotoxin) is produced by T cells. Both bind to either of the cell-surface receptors$\textemdash$tumor necrosis factor receptors I and II (TNFR-I and TNFR-II). These proteins give their name to a family of related proteins that typically regulate aspects of immune responses and cell death.
