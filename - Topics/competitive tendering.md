- The system of purchasing goods or services by inviting bids or 'tenders' and choosing the supplier from among the bids received. Other things being equal, the cheapest tender will be chosen, but purchasers will also be guided by their views on the technical and financial capacity of the bidders to deliver the goods and services reliably.
- Competitive tendering is also used in selecting applicants to run franchises or contracted-out public services.
