The striae gravidarum (stretch marks) are the lines that appear on the skin of the abdomen of pregnant women, due to excessive stretching of the elastic fibers. Red or purple during pregnancy, they become white after delivery. The stria terminalis is a white band that separates the thalamus from the ventricular surface of the caudate nucleus in the brain.
