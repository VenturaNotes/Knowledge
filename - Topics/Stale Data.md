- Stale data is data that is not relevant to a company's daily operations and, therefore, does not help them make real-time business decisions. Stale data often exists in the form of irrelevant data files and folders housed on company computer systems. Businesses typically require fresh data (recently updated data) to make good business decisions based on current market conditions.
