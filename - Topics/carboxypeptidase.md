- Any enzyme that catalyses the hydrolysis of amino acid residues from the carboxyl terminus of a peptide or polypeptide (see exopeptidase). Pancreatic juice contains a carboxypeptidase that is secreted into the duodenum. The enzyme is secreted as an inactive precursor, procarboxypeptidase, which is activated by another pancreatic protease, trypsin. See also CHYMOTRYPSIN.
