- (cryptorchism) $n$. the condition in which the testes fail to descend into the scrotum and are retained within the abdomen or inguinal canal. The operation of orchidopexy is necessary to bring the testes into the scrotum, ideally before the age of two years, in order to allow subsequent normal development; it is thought that the higher temperature in the abdomen interferes with sperm production. -cryptorchid adj., $n$.
