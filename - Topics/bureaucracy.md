## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A hierarchical administrative system designed to deal with large quantities of work in a routine manner, largely by adhering to a set of strict and impersonal rules; it is characterized by its permanence and stability, its body of experience and precedent, and its absence of a reliance on individuals. Bureaucracies have sprung up all over the world in the public and private sectors of an economy, in government, and in the service industries. It is generally believed to be the only viable structure for large sophisticated organizations. However, the modern strategies of downsizing, business process re-engineering, and total quality management have to some extent undermined the inevitability of its structures.
