- An interview in which an employee who has handed in his or her resignation is questioned by personnel staff. Such interviews can be useful to the employer because they provide a means of finding out the reasons why the employee is leaving, which may be helpful in designing policies that can help to retain staff (e.g. by improving promotion opportunities or job satisfaction).
