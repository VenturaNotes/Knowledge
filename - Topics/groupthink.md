## Source[^2]
- $n$. A collective pattern of defensive avoidance, characteristic of group decision making in organizations in which group members develop rationalizations supporting shared illusions of their own infallibility and invulnerability within the organization. The US psychologist Irving Lester Janis (1918-90), who introduced the term in his book Victims of Groupthink (1972), listed eight characteristic features: an illusion of invulnerability; collective efforts to rationalize in order to discount warnings; an unquestioned belief in the group's inherent morality; stereotyped views of rivals and enemies; direct pressure on any member who dissents from the consensus view; self-censorship of disagreements with the apparent group consensus; a shared illusion of unanimity; and the emergence of self-appointed protectors of the group from adverse information that might undermine the existing complacency.
