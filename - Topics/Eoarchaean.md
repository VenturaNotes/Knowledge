- (Eoarchean) The earliest era of the Archaean eon, extending from around 4000 million years ago (mya) to about 3600 mya. It is marked by the accretion of rocks from the molten material that characterized the earth in the preceding Hadean eon. There is some evidence of biological life, inferred from isotopic ratios of certain rocks from this time.
