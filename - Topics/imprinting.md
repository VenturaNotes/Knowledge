- (1) (in animal behavior) a rapid and irreversible form of learning that takes place in some animals during the first hours of life. Animals attach themselves in this way to members of their own species, but if they are exposed to creatures of a different species during this short period, they become attached to this species instead. 
- (2) (in genetics) a phenomenon whereby gene expression depends on whether the chromosome is maternal or paternal in origin. For example, both PraderWilli syndrome and Angelman syndrome are caused by a deletion of the same part of chromosome 15. When the deletion involves the chromosome 15 that came from the father, the child has Prader-Willi syndrome; inheritance of the same deletion from the mother results in Angelman syndrome.

- (1) (in ethology) A specialized form of learning in which young animals, during a critical period (or sensitive period) in their early development, learn to recognize and approach some large moving object nearby. In nature this is usually the mother, though simple models or individuals of a different species (including humans) may suffice. Imprinting was first described by Konrad Lorenz, working with young ducks and geese. See LEARNING IN ANIMALS (Feature).

## Source[^3]
- $n$. In ethology, a form of rapid learning (1) that takes place during a critical period of development immediately or shortly after birth and is extremely resistant to extinction (2), the most familiar example being the behavior of newly hatched ducklings that become imprinted on, and subsequently follow around, virtually any moving object to which they are exposed during the critical period following hatching. It was first studied in detail in 1935 by the Austrian zoologist Konrad (Zacharias) Lorenz (1903-89). Also called filial imprinting. See also GENETIC IMPRINTING. Compare ATTACHMENT THEORY.
