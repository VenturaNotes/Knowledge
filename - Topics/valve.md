- $n$. a structure found in some tubular organs or parts that restricts the flow of fluid within them to one direction only. Valves are important structures in the heart, veins, and lymphatic vessels. Such a valve consists of two or three cusps fastened like pockets to the walls of the vessel. Blood flowing in the right direction flattens the cusps to the walls, but when flow is reversed the cusps become filled with blood or lymph and dilate to block the opening (see illustration). See also AORTIC VALVE; MITRAL VALVE; PULMONARY VALVE; TRICUSPID VALVE.

	- Valve. (A) Cut vein showing the two cusps of a valve; (B) action of a venous valve.
	- Parts
		- Valve open
		- direction of blood flow
		- blood pressure closes valve so preventing backflow
## Source[^2]
- (1) Any of various structures for restricting the flow of a fluid through an aperture or along a tube to one direction. Valves in the heart (see BICUSPID VALVE; SEMILUNAR VALVE; TRICUSPID VALVE), veins, and lymphatic vessels consist of two or three flaps of tissue (cusps) fastened to the walls. The cusps are flattened to the walls to allow the normal passage of blood or lymph, but a reverse flow causes them to block the vessel or aperture, so preventing further backflow. 
- (2) Any of the parts that make up a capsule or other dry fruit that sheds its seeds. 
- (3) One of the two halves of the cell wall of a diatom. 
- (4) Either of the two hinged portions of the shell of a bivalve mollusc.
