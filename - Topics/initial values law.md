- $n$. In the study of drug effects, the notion that the effect of a drug on a measurable variable may depend on the level of that variable at the time of administration or, more generally, that the dose-response curve of a drug may depend on the starting level of the effect variable. As an example, a central nervous system stimulant may have a strong positive effect on the arousal of a drowsy person but may have very little effect, or even a depressant effect, on a highly aroused person. In relation to behavior, the law is also called the rate-dependency effect. See also METHYLPHENIDATE (RITALIN).
