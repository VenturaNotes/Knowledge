- A class of theoretical models that describe the comovement of macroeconomic variables in an open or a closed economy. A typical DSGE model is based on microeconomic foundations with utility-maximizing consumers, profit-maximizing firms, and a price mechanism to ensure market clearing. The market structure is often modeled as monopolistic competition. DSGE models assume that economic fundamentals are subjected to random shocks which drive short-term fluctuations in the modelâ€™s variables. It is typical for models to include various real and nominal rigidities, such as habit persistence in consumption and sticky nominal prices and wages. Policy-makers are represented by a monetary authority that sets an interest rate according to some monetary rule, usually as a feedback rule in response to the deviation of the inflation rate and the output gap from their target values, and by a fiscal authority that chooses the level of government spending which is financed by either taxes or debt. DSGE models are a popular analytical tool in New Keynesian economics and are widely used in policy analysis and forecasting.
