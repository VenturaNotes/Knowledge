- a vaccine that gives protection against the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib). Before the introduction of the vaccine in the UK in 1992, Hib was the commonest cause of meningitis in children under the age of 2 years. The vaccine, which has an excellent safety record, is currently given with the primary vaccines at 2, 3, and 4 months of age and as a booster at 12 months of age to extend protection against Hib meningitis. See IMMUNIZATION.
