- Master content management (MCM)Â refers to the workflow processes that businesses and IT departments use to guarantee the accuracy, standardization, and accountability of shared data assets. Those assets include enterprise information such as customer intake forms and employee contracts.
- MCM also relates to a set of identifiers and attributes businesses apply to unstructured data. Organizations can incorporate these data sets into a content management system (CMS) and link that system to a master data management (MDM) application. By doing so, organizations can align data to their marketing, sales, and operational objectives.
