- (market-risk premium) 
- (1) The difference between the expected rate of return on an investment and the risk-free rate of return over the same period. If there is any risk element at all, the rate of return should be higher than if no risk were involved. See CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL. 
- (2) An addition to the normal price of a transaction to reflect any extra risk involved.

- (1) The amount that a risk-averse individual is willing to pay to avoid a risk. Consider an individual with initial wealth $W$ and facing a risky prospect that will lead to a final wealth, $\tilde{W}$, that is random. The risk premium, $\rho$, is defined by$$U(W-\rho)=E[U(W)]$$so that it equates the utility of the certain wealth level, $W-\rho$, to the expected utility of the risky wealth level, $\tilde{W}$. If $E[\tilde{W}]=W$ then $\rho>0$ when the utility function is strictly concave.
- (2) The additional return that a risky asset must pay over that paid by the risk-free security in order to induce risk-averse investors to purchase it. The risk premium is endogenously determined by the equilibrium in financial markets. For example, in the Capital Asset Pricing Model the risk premium on asset $i$ is given by $\beta_{i}\left(r_{m}-r_{f}\right)$, where $\beta_{i}$ is the beta coefficient of asset $i, r_{m}$ is the expected return on the market portfolio, and $r_{f}$ is the return on the risk-free security.
