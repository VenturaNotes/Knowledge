- (female circumcision) removal of the clitoris, labia minora, and labia majora for cultural reasons. The extent of excision varies between countries and ethnic groups. The anatomically least damaging form is clitoridectomy (removal of the clitoris); the next form entails excision of the prepuce, clitoris, and all or part of the labia minora. The most extensive form, infibulation, involves excision of clitoris, labia minora, and labia majora. The vulval lips are sutured together and a piece of wood or reed is inserted to preserve a small passage for urine and menstrual fluid. In the majority of women who are circumcised, episiotomy, often extensive, is required to allow delivery of a child. FGM removes most of the possibility of sexual pleasure for a woman, is unethical, and in children is a form of child abuse: it is prohibited under the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003.
