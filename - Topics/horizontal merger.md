- A merger between firms at the same stage of production. This may be desired because of cost savings from combined operation, or because a larger firm will be able to use monopoly power against its customers or monopsony power against its suppliers and workers. A horizontal merger is contrasted with a vertical merger, where a firm merges with a supplier or a customer.
