- $n$. plastic surgery of the breasts, in order to alter their shape or increase or decrease their size. In the case of sagging breasts skin and glandular tissue are removed and the remaining breast tissue is fixed in the normal position. After a mastectomy, or when the breasts are too small, a prosthesis (see BREAST IMPLANT) may be inserted to improve the contour.
