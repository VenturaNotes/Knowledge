- (1) The means by which an encoding process is effected (see CODE). It may be implemented in hardware or software, the process being algorithmic in nature.
- (2) A logic circuit, usually an integrated circuit, that generates a unique $n$-bit binary word, indicating which of its $2^{\mathrm{n}}$ input lines is active, i.e. at logic 1 . A [[keyboard encoder]], for example, may be required to generate a unique binary code indicating which key on the keyboard has been pressed.
- If two or more of the device inputs can be active simultaneously then a [[priority encoder]] is required, which usually encodes only the highest-order data input.
