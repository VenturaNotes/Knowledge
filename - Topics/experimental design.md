- A system of allocating treatments to experimental units so that the effects of the treatments may be estimated by statistical methods. The basic principles of experimental design are replication, i.e. the application of the same treatment to several units, randomization, which ensures that each unit has the same probability of receiving any given treatment, and blocking, i.e. grouping of similar units, each one to receive a different treatment. Factorial designs are used to allow different types of treatment, or factors, to be tested simultaneously. Analysis of variance is used to assess the significance of the treatment effects. See also FRACTIONAL REPLICATION, MISSING OBSERVATIONS.
