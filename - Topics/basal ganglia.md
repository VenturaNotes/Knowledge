- Basal ganglia receives information from the cerebral cortex and travels first to the caudate or putamen
## Source[^2]
- several large masses of grey matter embedded deep within the white matter of the cerebrum (see illustration). They include the caudate and lenticular nuclei (together known as the corpus striatum) and the amygdaloid nucleus. The lenticular nucleus consists of the putamen and globus pallidus. The basal ganglia have complex neural connections with both the cerebral cortex and thalamus: they are involved with the regulation of voluntary movements at a subconscious level. Diseases of the basal ganglia cause a range of disorders predominantly affecting movement, the commonest being parkinsonism.
