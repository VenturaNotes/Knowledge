- (BSI Group) An institution founded in 1901, which received a royal charter in 1929. Its function is to formulate technical standards for building, engineering, chemical, textile, and electrical products, etc., ensuring that they maintain a specified quality. Products certified by the BSI are entitled to use the Kitemark logo as a symbol of reliability. Manufacturers who use the Kitemark do so under licence on condition that products are subject to regular inspection. The BSI also operates the European Union's CE certification scheme in the UK for products that come under the relevant EU directives. Apart from maintaining quality and safety standards in this way, the BSI attempts to ensure that the design of goods is restricted to a sensible number of patterns and sizes for one purpose, to avoid unnecessary variety. In this work the BSI collaborates closely with the International Standards Organization.
- A subdivision of the group, BSI Management Systems, provides quality assessments of management systems worldwide and advises organizations on how to improve their efficiency, health and safety record, and environmental sustainability.
