- (tympanic cavity) the part of the ear that consists of an air-filled space within the petrous part of the temporal bone. It is lined with mucous membrane and is connected to the pharynx by the Eustachian tube and to the outer ear by the eardrum (tympanic membrane). Within the middle ear are three bones $\textendash$ the auditory ossicles $\textendash$ which transmit sound vibrations from the outer ear to the inner ear (see LABYRINTH).

- (tympanic cavity) The air-filled cavity within the skull of vertebrates that lies between the outer ear and the inner ear. It is linked to the pharynx (and therefore to outside air) via the Eustachian tube and in mammals contains the three ear ossicles, which transmit auditory vibrations from the outer ear (via the tympanum) to the inner ear (via the oval window).

- $n$. The sound-transmitting intermediate part of the ear, filled with air and containing the malleus, incus, and stapes, separated from the outer ear by the tympanic membrane and from the inner ear by the round window (fenestra rotunda) and oval window (fenestra ovalis). See also Eustachian tube.
