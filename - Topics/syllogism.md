## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- An argument consisting of three categorical propositions where the truth of the first two requires the third (the conclusion) also to be true. For example, 'All men are mortal; Socrates is a man; therefore Socrates is mortal.'
- Any syllogism must relate to three entities (which can be a group, an individual entity, or a concept$\textemdash$here 'men', Socrates', and 'mortality'), each of which appears exactly twice.
