- $n$. A paraphilia characterized by recurrent sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behavior associated with having a partner with an amputated leg. It is found among both heterosexual and homosexual men and women and should be carefully distinguished from apotemnophilia. People with acrotomorphilia often refer to themselves as devotees. Also called monopede mania, monopedophilia, or unipedophilia, but the latter two forms are liable to cause confusion with paedophilia. \[From Greek akron a tip + tome a cut + morphe a form or shape + philos loving, from phileein to love + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
