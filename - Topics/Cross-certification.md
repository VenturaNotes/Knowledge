- Cross-certification is the process of verifying the security of two or more organizations. This is done by exchanging cryptographic keys, which allows each organization to trust the other. This is essential for businesses to share confidential information with their partners. Cross-certification can be done manually or through a trusted third party. It is an important security measure because it helps to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks. This prevents an unauthorized person from intercepting and decrypting communications between two parties.
