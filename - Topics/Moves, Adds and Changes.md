- Moves, adds, and changes (MAC) is a term used in IT to describe the process of making changes to an existing network. This can include adding new devices or users, changing the configuration of existing devices, or moving equipment from one location to another. This process is often time-consuming and can be challenging to manage without the proper tools.
