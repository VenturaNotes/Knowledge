- The structure formed from the ovary of a flower, usually after the ovules have been fertilized (see also Parthenocarpy). It consists of the fruit wall (see pericarp) enclosing the seed(s). Other parts of the flower, such as the receptacle, may develop and contribute to the structure, resulting in a false fruit (see PSEUDOCARP). The fruit may retain the seeds and be dispersed whole (an indehiscent fruit), or it may open (dehisce) to release the seeds (a dehiscent fruit). Fruits are divided into two main groups depending on whether the ovary wall remains dry or becomes fleshy (succulent). Succulent fruits are generally dispersed by animals and dry fruits by wind, water, or by some mechanical means. See illustration. See also COMPOSITE FRUIT.
