- Hedge funds are actively managed pools of investments that take higher-risk investment approaches, with the goal of maximizing returns. The minimum investment amounts for such an approach are usually very high. Hedge funds have mixed success. Although they are on the rise, they don't always perform as well as expected. Hedge fund managers often invest in wildly differing industries in effort to ensure returns even in economically challenging times. Hedge fund strategies include short-selling, derivatives, and leverage.

- A unit trust that is subject to minimum regulation, typically a partnership or mutual fund that attempts to achieve large gains by exploiting market anomalies. These funds are often high-return and are regarded as speculative. Typically, they accept only accredited investors, require a high minimum level of investment ($Â£ 500,000$ or more), and pay high performance-related fees to managers. Many are domiciled in offshore financial centres.
