- Hedge funds are actively managed pools of investments that take higher-risk investment approaches, with the goal of maximizing returns. The minimum investment amounts for such an approach are usually very high. Hedge funds have mixed success. Although they are on the rise, they don't always perform as well as expected. Hedge fund managers often invest in wildly differing industries in effort to ensure returns even in economically challenging times. Hedge fund strategies include short-selling, derivatives, and leverage.
