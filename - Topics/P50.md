- n. An evoked potential in response to a brief auditory stimulus such as a click, occurring about 50 milliseconds after the stimulus. The P50 response usually decreases if the stimulus is repeated many times, and this is usually attributed to habituation, but many people with schizophrenia manifest abnormally persistent P50 responses, suggesting an impaired ability in such people of the brain to habituate to sensory stimulation. Also called the P50 potential or P50 wave. \[Fom p(ositive) 50 (milliseconds)]
