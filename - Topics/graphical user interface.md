- An interface between a user and a computer system that makes use of input devices other than the keyboard and presentation techniques other than alphanumeric characters. Typical GUIs involve the use of windows, icons, menus, and pointing devices. The windows can contain control objects such as dialogue boxes, slider bars, radio buttons, check boxes, and pick lists, as well as textual or graphical information. The objects forming the interface display have attributes such as the ability to be resized, moved around the display, shrunk down to an icon, or given different colours. Perhaps the best-known GUIs are those used on Microsoft Windows PCs and Apple Macintosh computers, although there are several others in common use.
## Source[^2]
- A graphical user interface (GUI) refers to a system that interacts with the user visually. This GUI includes things like menus, icons for programs and applications, and browser windows. Nearly all modern-day computer operating systems, including those found on smartphones, tablets, and laptops, use this interface to simplify usage. The alternative to a GUI is known as a CLI, or a command line interface. A CLI requires users to manage a system using text-based commands, which is not as user-friendly because users must have in-depth coding knowledge to operate it.
## Source[^3]
- (GUI) A system that enables the user of a computer or hand-held device to operate software without a keyboard or without needing to learn a command language. GUIs rely on graphically presented menus, button-bars, and icons, which are activated by using a mouse or touching the screen.
