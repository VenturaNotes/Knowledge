- An interface between a user and a computer system that makes use of input devices other than the keyboard and presentation techniques other than alphanumeric characters. Typical GUIs involve the use of windows, icons, menus, and pointing devices. The windows can contain control objects such as dialogue boxes, slider bars, radio buttons, check boxes, and pick lists, as well as textual or graphical information. The objects forming the interface display have attributes such as the ability to be resized, moved around the display, shrunk down to an icon, or given different colours. Perhaps the best-known GUIs are those used on Microsoft Windows PCs and Apple Macintosh computers, although there are several others in common use.
