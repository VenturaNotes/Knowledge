- increasing returns to scale In a production process, average productivity increasing with output. This means that increasing all inputs in the same proportion results in a more than proportional increase in output. Formally, consider the function $f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$. If the function satisfies the assumption of increasing returns to scale then$$f\left(\lambda x_{1}, \ldots, \lambda x_{n}\right)>\lambda f\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$$for any $\lambda>1$.
