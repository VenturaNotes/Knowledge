- a hereditary disorder characterized by craniosynostosis, underdevelopment of the midfacial tissues resulting in a sunken facial appearance, and syndactyly (fusion) of 2-5 digits ('mitten glove'). Variable mental deficits and cleft palate may result. The condition may be associated with Crouzon syndrome, in which case the fusion of the digits is less marked. See also ACROCEPHALOSYNDACTYLY. \[E. Apert (18681940), French physician]
