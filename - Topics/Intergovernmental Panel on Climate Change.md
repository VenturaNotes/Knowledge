- (IPCC) An international body established by the United Nations Environment Programme and the World Meteorological Organization. The role of the IPCC is to review and assess published scientific literature on climate change in order to provide regular reviews of the state of knowledge. The IPCC claims to be policy-neutral but has been criticized for pursuing an agenda that promotes the concept of climate change. It does not conduct independent research so is not in a position to verify or refute the research it reviews. See also CLIMATE CHANGE; GLOBAL WARMING; HOCKEY STICK.
