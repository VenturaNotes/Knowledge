- $n$. A metaphor proposed by the Hungarian-born US psychologist Egon Brunswik (1903-55) to highlight the probabilistic relationships between, on the one hand, an ecological criterion, and on the other, the sensory cues (2) of imperfect ecological validity (2) that an organism uses to judge the ecological criterion, the cues being focused by cognitive processes like rays of light on to the ecological criterion.
