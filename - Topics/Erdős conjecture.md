- The conjecture that if a subset S of the positive integers satisfies $$\sum_{n \in S} \frac 1n = \infty,$$then the set S contains arbitrarily long arithmetic progressions. The conjecture is unproven. The Green-Tao theorem proves the conjecture true in the special case when $S$ is the set of prime numbers.
