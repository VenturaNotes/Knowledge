## Source[^2]
- A muscle that runs along the large bone of the upper arm (humerus) and is connected to the radius at one end and the shoulder bone (scapula) at the other. Contraction of the biceps causes the arm to flex at the elbow joint (see FLEXOR). It works antagonistically with the triceps, which contracts to extend the arm (see ANTAGONISM). See also SKELETAL MUSCLE.
