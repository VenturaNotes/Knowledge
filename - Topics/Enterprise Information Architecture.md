- Enterprise information architecture (EIA) describes an enterprise's data structure and organization, including how employees collect, organize, and access information. An EIA can help improve business operations by streamlining a company's data management processes. While EIA deals with IT assets, it is a small part of a business's overall enterprise architecture, encompassing all aspects of the company, including its people, processes, and technologies.
