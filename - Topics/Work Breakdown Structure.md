- WBS is a project management tool used to break a project down into smaller, more manageable tasks. The WBS can be used by individuals or teams and helps ensure that all necessary steps are taken to complete a project. The WBS is often used in conjunction with other tools such as Gantt charts, which help visualize how each task in the WBS relates to each other.
