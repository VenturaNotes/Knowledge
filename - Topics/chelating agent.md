- a chemical compound whose molecules form complexes by binding metal ions. Some chelating agents, including desferrioxamine and penicillamine, are drugs used to treat metal poisoning: the metal is bound to the drug and excreted safely. Chelating agents often form the active centres of enzymes. The chelating agent ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) is used in dentistry to remove the smear layer before root canal filling.
