- A continuous choice of the sense of handedness in a space. A line may be assigned one or two directions. A simple, closed plane curve may be positively oriented or assigned an outward-pointing normal. Left- and right-handed systems are two different orientations of 3-dimensional space. Two bases of $\mathbb{R}^n$ give the same orientation if the change of basis matrix has positive determinant. Some spaces, such as the MÃ¶bius band and Klein bottle, are non-orientable and so have no orientation. See also STOKES' THEOREM

- $n$. (in psychology) awareness of oneself in time, space, and place. Orientation may be disturbed in such conditions as organic brain disease, toxic drug states, mental illness, and concussion.
