- A type of scanner in which a beam of light (usually from a laser) is deflected by a rotating hologram so that it scans a plane in a multitude of directions. Some of the light reflected from an object on or close to the plane is returned via the hologram and brought to focus on a sensor. The most widely known use is for reading bar codes at retail checkouts.
