## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The act of creating a model of something for a particular purpose, such as to describe it, understand it, or derive some properties. The process involves deciding which simplifications, idealizations, or abstractions to make, what kinds of representations to adopt, and how to express the selected properties of the referent. The context of a prospective system may be modeled as part of the systems analysis. A program or software-based system may be modeled to produce an abstract design or for nonfunctional properties such as performance.
