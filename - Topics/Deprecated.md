- Deprecated refers to a software program or programming language feature that is supported but not recommended for optimal performance. Usually, deprecated software attributes will be available to use until they are phased out by the company the software is owned by. Deprecated features are often faulty or outdated, resulting in them being replaced by more innovative, optimal features in the near future.
