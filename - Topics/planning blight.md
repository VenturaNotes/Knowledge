- Difficulty in selling or developing a site, building, etc., because it is affected by a government or local-authority development plan. Planning blight may be ended by a compulsory purchase by the government or local authority, but it may continue indefinitely if the government plans fail to mature or if the site itself is not required by the development but is rendered unsaleable or less valuable by its proximity to a development.
