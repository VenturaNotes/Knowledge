## Source[^2]
- (1) n. a group of cells (usually bacteria) descended from a single cell by asexual reproduction and therefore genetically identical to each other and to the parent cell. 
- (2) n. an organism derived from a single cell of its parent and therefore genetically identical to it. The first cloned animal, born in 1997, was produced by fusing a somatic nucleus of the parent with a denucleated egg cell of a second animal. The resulting 'embryo' was implanted into the uterus of a third animal to complete its development. 
- (3) n. (gene clone) a group of identical genes produced by genetic engineering. The parent gene is isolated using restriction enzymes and inserted, via a cloning vector (e.g. a bacteriophage), into a bacterium, in which it is replicated. See also VECTOR. 
- (4) vb. to form a clone. See also CLONING.
