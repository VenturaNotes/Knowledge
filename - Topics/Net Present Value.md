- Net present value (NPV) is a calculation to find the current value of an investment. It's the difference between total discounted cash flow and a current investment. If the calculation is positive, it means the current investment is probably a good one. If the calculation is negative, it means the opposite. Businesses need access to cash flow figures to calculate NPV.
## Source[^2]
- (NPV) A method of capital budgeting in which the value of an investment is calculated as the total present value of all cash inflows and cash outflows minus the cost of the initial investment. If the net present value is positive, the return will be greater than that required by the capital markets and the investment should be considered. A negative net present value indicates that the investment should be rejected. Many spreadsheet programs now include a calculator for NPV. See also DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW.

- The present value of a security or an investment project, taking into account both costs and receipts. The net present value is calculated by summing the discounted value of all present and future receipts and costs. If the net present value calculated is positive, it is worthwhile investing in the project or buying the security. If the receipts or outgoings are subject to uncertainty, the appropriate rate of discount has to include a risk premium that reflects the degree of risk.
