- Net present value (NPV) is a calculation to find the current value of an investment. It's the difference between total discounted cash flow and a current investment. If the calculation is positive, it means the current investment is probably a good one. If the calculation is negative, it means the opposite. Businesses need access to cash flow figures to calculate NPV.
