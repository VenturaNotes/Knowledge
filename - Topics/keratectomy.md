- $n$. an operation in which a part of the cornea is removed, usually a superficial layer. This procedure is now frequently done by an excimer laser, either to correct refractive errors (myopia, hypermetropia), by reshaping the surface of the cornea (photorefractive keratectomy; PRK), or to remove diseased corneal tissue (phototherapeutic keratectomy). See also AUTOMATED LAMELLAR KERATECTOMY.
