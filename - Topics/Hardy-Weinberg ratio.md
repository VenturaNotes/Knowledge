- The ratio of genotype frequencies that evolve when mating in a population is random. In the case where only two characteristics A and B are involved, with proportions $p$ and $1-p$ in the population, then the ratio of the three possible pairs of genes can be derived from simple combinatorial probabilities. AA, AB, and BB will occur in the ration $p^2$: $2p(1-p): (1-p)^2$ after a single generation
