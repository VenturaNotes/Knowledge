- A self-describing message contains data and metadata to describe the format and meaning of that data. It contains the data required to understand the message and any information necessary to carry out a task. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) uses a self-describing message format consisting of tag and value pairs. Self-describing messages reduce coupling, which occurs when two or more functions share the same data. In such instances, changing these functions is difficult because they are dependent on each other.
