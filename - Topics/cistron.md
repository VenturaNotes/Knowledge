## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. the section of a DNA or RNA chain that controls the amino-acid sequence of a single polypeptide chain in protein synthesis. A cistron can be regarded as the functional equivalent of a gene.
## Source[^2]
- The unit of genetic function defined by the cis-trans test, operationally equivalent to a gene.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A sequence of DNA constituting a single functional gene or coding for a single polypeptide; defined more rigorously by the cis-trans complementation test, two recessive mutations within a single cistron failing to complement each other in a heterozygous phenotype when on different chromosomes but showing complementation when on the same chromosome. See also OPERON. \[From cis-trans, on the model of codon]
