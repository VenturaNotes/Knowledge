- In the computer programming industry, incremental operators are used to increase the numerical value of an operand (an object of a mathematical equation that is capable of being manipulated, such as a constant or a variable) in a coding sequence. In certain programming languages such as Perl or C#, increment operators are written as (++). In the Scrum framework (a framework used by businesses to emphasize teamwork, accountability and iterative progress towards set business goals), an increment occurs when a product backlog item meets the definition of done. In other words, an increment is a completed item or sum of the completed items on a Scrum team ªs to-do list that meets the quality measures required for a specific product.
