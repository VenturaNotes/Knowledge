## Synthesis
- The sum of all the product backlog items completed during a sprint and the value of the increments of all previous sprints.
	- #question Wait, so is this just saying an increment is just the value of items completed during a sprint? Does an item have a weight to it so one might be a value of 2 while another could be a value of 5?

- In the computer programming industry, incremental operators are used to increase the numerical value of an operand (an object of a mathematical equation that is capable of being manipulated, such as a constant or a variable) in a coding sequence. In certain programming languages such as Perl or C#, increment operators are written as (++). In the Scrum framework (a framework used by businesses to emphasize teamwork, accountability and iterative progress towards set business goals), an increment occurs when a product backlog item meets the definition of done. In other words, an increment is a completed item or sum of the completed items on a Scrum teamʻs to-do list that meets the quality measures required for a specific product.
