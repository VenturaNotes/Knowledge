- An indication from a taxing authority that a certain provision does not apply to a particular transaction. The procedure is only available when specified by statute, as, for example, on the reorganization of a company's share capital and on the demerger of a company's trade. Exceptionally, the Revenue grants a clearance under the extra-statutory concessional treatment whereby a dividend paid on the liquidation of a company is subject to capital gains tax and not to income tax.
