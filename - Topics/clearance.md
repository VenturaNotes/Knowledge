- An indication from a taxing authority that a certain provision does not apply to a particular transaction. The procedure is only available when specified by statute, as, for example, on the reorganization of a company's share capital and on the demerger of a company's trade. Exceptionally, the Revenue grants a clearance under the extra-statutory concessional treatment whereby a dividend paid on the liquidation of a company is subject to capital gains tax and not to income tax.

- (renal clearance) $n$. a quantitative measure of the rate at which waste products are removed from the blood by the kidneys or through the process of dialysis. It is expressed in terms of the volume of blood that could be completely cleared of a particular substance in a particular unit of time. Clearance by the kidney is usually measured as $\mathrm{ml} / \mathrm{min}$ while clearance with, say, peritoneal dialysis is usually measured in litres/week.
