- pain on entry or touch of the vulva, with redness of the vestibular glands, tenderness on pressure, and dyspareunia. The pain, which is localized, is described as a severe burning sensation; itching is not usually a feature (compare vulvitis). The condition seems to be more common in premenopausal Caucasian women with a history of anxiety and related disorders. See also vulVODYNIA.
