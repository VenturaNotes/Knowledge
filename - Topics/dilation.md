- (dilatation) A dilation of the plane from $O$ with scale factor $c \ne 0$ is the transformation of the plane in which the origin $O$ is mapped to itself and a point $P$ is mapped to the point $P'$, where $O, P \text{ and } P'$ are collinear and $OP' = cOP$. This is given in terms of Cartesian coordinates by $x' = cx, y' = cy$.
