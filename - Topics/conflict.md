- $n$. (in psychology) the state produced when a stimulus produces two opposing reactions. The basic types of conflict situation are approach-approach, in which the individual is drawn towards two attractive $\textendash$ but mutually incompatible $\textendash$ goals; approach-avoidance, where the stimulus evokes reactions both to approach and to avoid; and avoidance-avoidance, in which the avoidance reaction to one stimulus would bring the individual closer to an equally unpleasant stimulus. Conflict has been used to explain the development of neurotic disorders, and the resolution of conflict remains an important part of psychoanalysis. See also CONVERSION.
