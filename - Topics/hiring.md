- Taking on new employees. This is an important function of the management of a firm. Hiring is less subject to regulation than firing, so far as the number of new workers taken on is concerned. There are, however, various legal restrictions on how new workers are chosen; for example, discrimination by race or sex may be illegal, while, on the other hand, discrimination by nationality may be compulsory.
