## Synthesis
- When [[Depth first search|DFS]] is applied to a graph, it implicitly constructs a "search tree" or "DFS tree". The tree represents the paths taken by the algorithm during its traversal. The edges in this tree are the edges of the original graph that were traversed during the DFS. It's a subset of the original graph's edges that shows the order of discovery and traversal 
	- #question Does edges mean the same thing as vertices? 
	- #question Why would it be a subset?
