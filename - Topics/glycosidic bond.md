- (glycosidic link) The type of chemical linkage between the monosaccharide units of disaccharides, oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides, which is formed by the removal of a molecule of water (i.e. a condensation reaction). The bond is normally formed between the carbon-1 on one sugar and the carbon-4 on the other (see illustration). An $\alpha$-glycosidic bond is formed when the -OH group on carbon-1 is below the plane of the glucose ring and a $\beta$-glycosidic bond is formed when it is above the plane. Cellulose is formed of glucose molecules linked by 1-4 $\beta$-glycosidic bonds, whereas starch is composed of 1-4 $\alpha$-glycosidic bonds.
