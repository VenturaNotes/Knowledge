- (duramen) The wood at the centre of a tree trunk or branch. It consists of dead xylem cells heavily thickened with lignin and provides structural support. Many heartwood cells contain oils, gums, and resins, which darken the wood and provide protection against fungi and wood-boring insects. Compare SAPWOOD.
