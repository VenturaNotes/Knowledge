- A prolonged period of abnormally low economic activity and abnormally high unemployment. This is often accompanied by a tendency for prices to fall, or at least to rise more slowly than usual, and by a fall in the relative prices of primary products as compared with those of industrial products. See also RECESSION.

- (slump) An extended or severe period of recession. Depressions occur infrequently. The most recent Great Depression occurred in the 1930s; prior to that they occurred in the periods 1873-96, 1844-51, and 1810-17. Depressions are usually associated with falling prices (see DEFLATION) and large-scale involuntary unemployment. They are often preceded by major financial crashes, e.g. the Wall Street crash of 1929. See also BUSINESS CYCLE.
