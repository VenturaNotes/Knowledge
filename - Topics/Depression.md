- A prolonged period of abnormally low economic activity and abnormally high unemployment. This is often accompanied by a tendency for prices to fall, or at least to rise more slowly than usual, and by a fall in the relative prices of primary products as compared with those of industrial products. See also RECESSION.

- (slump) An extended or severe period of recession. Depressions occur infrequently. The most recent Great Depression occurred in the 1930s; prior to that they occurred in the periods 1873-96, 1844-51, and 1810-17. Depressions are usually associated with falling prices (see DEFLATION) and large-scale involuntary unemployment. They are often preceded by major financial crashes, e.g. the Wall Street crash of 1929. See also BUSINESS CYCLE.

- n. 
- (1) a mental state characterized by excessive sadness. 
- (2) a mood disorder characterized by the pervasive and persistent presence of core and somatic symptoms on most days for at least two weeks. Core symptoms include low mood and loss or impairment of motivation, energy, interest, and enjoyment. Somatic symptoms include impaired memory and concentration, loss of appetite and libido, insomnia, early morning wakening (more than two hours earlier than normal), physical and mental activity that is either agitated and restless or slow and retarded, and a diurnal variation of mood (usually patients feel particularly depressed in the mornings). Additional symptoms include automatic negative thoughts, pessimistic views of oneself, the future, and the present (Beck's triad of depression), suicidal ideation, tearfulness, alexithymia, and a poor frustration tolerance. A single period of experiencing these symptoms is called a major depressive episode; experiencing one or more of such episodes (without mania) is known as major depression, major depressive disorder, or clinical depression. Depression may or may not be triggered by stressful events or trauma. Risk factors include genetic and social elements (e.g. poverty, lack of confidants, substance abuse) and psychological elements (e.g. the presence of personality disorder, a history of abuse or dysthymia). Treatment is with antidepressant drugs, cognitive behavioral therapy, and/or psychotherapy. Severe cases may need electroconvulsive therapy. The course of the illness can be a single episode or recurrent episodes, or it may become chronic. $\textemdash$depressive adj.
