- (AV bundle, bundle of His) a bundle of modified heart muscle fibres (Purkinje fibres) passing from the atrioventricular node forward to the septum between the ventricles, where it divides into right and left bundles, one for each ventricle. The fibres transmit contraction waves from the atria, via the AV node, to the ventricles.
