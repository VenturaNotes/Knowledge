- $n$. Another name for generalized anxiety disorder. The term was introduced by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) in the title of an article in 1894 'On the Grounds for Detaching a Particular Syndrome from Neurasthenia Under the Description "Anxiety Neurosis" , (Standard Edition, I, pp. 315-44), in which he distinguished it from neurasthenia, because of the predominance of anxiety, and from hysteria, because unlike hysteria, he interpreted it as an actual neurosis.
