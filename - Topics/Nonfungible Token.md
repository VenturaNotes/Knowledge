- A nonfungible token (NFT) is a digital asset that represents unique physical or digital items such as real estate, videos, music, and artwork. Nonfungible tokens are bought and sold online and securely recorded on a digital ledger system known as blockchain, similar to cryptocurrencies. Each token contains an nontransferable, irreplaceable identity to differentiate it from other NFTs. Therefore, it's impossible for one NFT to be of equal value to another.
