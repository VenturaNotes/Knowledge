- The proposition that in cyclical fluctuations, the ratio of actual to potential real output generally rises by a greater percentage than the fall in unemployment. On the basis of data on the US economy from 1960 to 1980 Arthur Okun (1928-1980) put the ratio of proportional changes in output to those of unemployment at around 3. This effect is believed to be due partly to short-run increasing returns to employment, and partly to a tendency for some workers to drop out from the labour force when laid off, rather than appearing as unemployed.
