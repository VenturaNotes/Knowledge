- $n$. Erotic feelings between close relatives, often between siblings or between parents and children, who are separated early in life and reunited in adolescence or adulthood. The phenomenon was first recognized following the relaxation of adoption laws in the US and the UK in the mid-1970s, providing adopted children with easier access to their adoption records and enabling them to trace their blood relatives. The term was introduced in a newsletter published in 1987 by the US adoption counselor Barbara Gonyo (born 1937), who felt attracted to her own adult son when she was reunited with him in 1979, having given him up for adoption 26 years earlier. The term became more widely known after the publication of Gonyo's book, The Forbidden Love (Genetic Sexual Attraction) in 1991. See also inceSt taboo. GSA abbrev.
