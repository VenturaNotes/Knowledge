- (1) (of a code) For any $(n, k)$ block code or convolutional code, the value defined as$$R=k / n$$It is a measure of 'efficiency' in the sense that the more redundancy there is in the code, the lower the rate. On the other hand, high redundancy may bring about greater efficiency in detecting or correcting errors. Thus the rate measures only one aspect of the overall efficiency.
