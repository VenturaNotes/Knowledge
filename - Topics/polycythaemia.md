- $n$. an increase in the packed cell volume (haematocrit) in the blood. This may be due either to a decrease in the total volume of the plasma (relative polycythaemia) or to an increase in the total volume of the red cells (absolute polycythaemia). The latter may occur as a primary disease (see POLYCYTHAEMIA VERA) or as a secondary condition in association with various respiratory or circulatory disorders that cause deficiency of oxygen in the tissues and with certain tumours, such as carcinoma of the kidney.
