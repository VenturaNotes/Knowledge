- (vegetative reproduction) 
- (1) A form of asexual reproduction in plants whereby new individuals develop from specialized multicellular structures (e.g. tubers, bulbs) that become detached from the parent plant. Examples are the production of strawberry plants from runners and of gladioli from daughter corms. Artificial methods of vegetative propagation include grafting (see GRAFT), budding, and making cuttings. 
- (2) Asexual reproduction in animals, e.g. budding in Hydra.
