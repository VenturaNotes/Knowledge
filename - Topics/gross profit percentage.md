- (gross margin ratio) A ratio of financial performance calculated by expressing the gross profit as a percentage of sales. With retailing companies in particular, it is regarded as a prime measure of their trading success. The only ways in which a company can improve its gross margin ratio are to increase selling prices and/or reduce its cost of sales.
