It interferes with the normal metabolism of ethyl alcohol by blocking the action of the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase that normally converts it into acetic acid, allowing the noxious metabolite acetaldehyde to accumulate, resulting in nausea, vomiting, pounding of the heart, shortness of breath, and other unpleasant symptoms. \[Trademark]
