- Symbol $\gamma$. The property of a liquid that makes it behave as if its surface is enclosed in an elastic skin. The property results from intermolecular forces: a molecule in the interior of a liquid experiences a force of attraction from other molecules equally from all sides, whereas a molecule at the surface is only attracted by molecules below it in the liquid. The surface tension is defined as the force acting over the surface per unit length of surface perpendicular to the force. It is measured in newtons per meter. It can equally be defined as the energy required to increase the surface area by one square meter, i.e. it can be measured in joules per metre squared (which is equivalent to $\mathrm{N}~ \mathrm{m}^{-1}$).
- The surface tension of water is very strong, due to the intermolecular hydrogen bonding, and is responsible for the formation of drops, bubbles, and meniscuses (the curved surfaces of columns of liquid), as well as the rise of water in a capillary tube (capillarity), the absorption of liquids by porous substances, and the ability of liquids to wet a surface. Capillarity is very important in plants as it contributes to the transport of water, against gravity, within the plant.
