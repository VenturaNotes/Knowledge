- (1) a small instrument for measuring the pressure inside the eye. There are several types. The applanation tonometer measures the force required to flatten a known area of the cornea after a drop of local anaesthetic has made the cornea numb. A greater force is required when the pressure inside the eye is increased, and vice versa. The Goldmann applanation tonometer flattens a corneal area of $3 \mathrm{~mm}^{2}$. See also PNEUMOTONOMETER. 
- (2) an instrument for measuring pressure in some other part of the body.
