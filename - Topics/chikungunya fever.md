- a disease caused by an arbovirus and transmitted to humans by mosquitoes of the genus AÃ«des. The disease is similar to dengue and symptoms include fever, headache, joint and muscle pain, and an irritating rash. The patient is given drugs to relieve the pain and reduce the fever; the joint pain, which may progress to arthritis, can persist for up to three years after the infection. Chikungunya was first reported in Tanzania in 1952 and has since occurred in over sixty countries worldwide.
