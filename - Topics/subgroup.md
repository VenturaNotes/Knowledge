- A subset $T$ of a group $G$ on which the dyadic operation ${ }^{\circ}$ is defined; $T$ contains the identity, $e$, of $G$, the inverse $x^{-1}$ for any $x$ in $T$, and the quantity $x^{\circ} y$ for any $x$ and $y$ in $T$. For any group $G$ the set consisting of $e$ alone is a subgroup; so also is the group $G$ itself. All other subgroups are proper subgroups of $G$.
