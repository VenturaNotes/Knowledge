- Suppose that, for the binary operation $\circ$ on the set S, there is an identity element $e$. An element $a'$ is an inverse (or inverse element) of the element $a$ if $a\circ a' = a' \circ a = e$. If the operation is called multiplication, the identity element may be denoted by 1. Then the inverse $a'$ may be called a multiplicative inverse of $a$ and be denoted by $a^{-1}$, so that $aa^{-1} = a^{-1}a = 1$ (or e). If the operation is addition, the identity element is denoted by 0, and the inverse $a'$ may be called an additive inverse (or a negative) of $a$ and be denoted by $-a$, so that $a + (-a) = (-a) + a = 0$.
