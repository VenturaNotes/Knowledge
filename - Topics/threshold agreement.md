- An agreement between an employer and employees (or their union) that pay will increase by a specified amount if the rate of inflation exceeds a specified figure in a specified period. Threshold agreements are seen by some as providing an inflationary pressure of their own but others claim that they reduce inflation by making it unnecessary for unions to press for excessive settlements to protect their members against inflation.
