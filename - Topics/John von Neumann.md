- (1903-57) Hungarian-born US mathematician. Already a noted mathematician, von Neumann emigrated to the USA in 1930 and joined the faculty of Princeton University. His major contribution to computer science was his 'First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC' (1945), which described an architecture that has since been regarded as standard for digital computers (see EDVAC; VON NEUMANN MACHINE). However, this was only a part of his life's work, which also included major contributions to game theory, quantum physics, and statistics and numerical analysis as well as work on the atomic bomb during World War II.
