## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- If event A can occur in $m$ ways, and event B can occur in $n$ [[disjoint]] ways, then the event "A or B" can occur in $m+n$ ways
- This principle generalizes to more than two events
- "Or" doesn't always mean "add". ([[mutually exclusive]])
	- #question what is meant by mutually exclusive here?
### Example
- Given a restaurant offers 8 appetizers and 14 entrées, how many choices do you have if you will eat one dish, either an appetizer or an entrée. 
	- There are 8 + 14 = 22 choices if you will eat one dish
	- Could also represent this problem with disjoint sets where A contains 8 appetizers and B contains 14 entrées where finding the union of them would give the number of choices:
		- $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| = 8 + 14 = 22$
