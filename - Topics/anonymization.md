- A process that removes personally identifiable information from data sets or communications. Various data anonymization techniques can be used, including data encryption, substitution, shuffling, number and date variance, and nulling out specific fields or data sets. They can, however, be bypassed, by using de-anonymization, a data mining strategy in which anonymous data is cross-referenced with other data sources to re-identify the anonymous data source.
