## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- the tissue that supports, binds, or separates more specialized tissues and organs or functions as a packing tissue of the body. It consists of an amorphous ground substance of mucopolysaccharides in which may be embedded white (collagenous), yellow (elastic), and reticular fibers, fat cells, fibroblasts, mast cells, and macrophages (see illustration). Variations in chemical composition of the ground substance and in the proportions and quantities of cells and fibers give rise to tissues of widely differing characteristics, including bone, cartilage, tendons, and ligaments as well as adipose, areolar, and elastic tissues.

## Source[^2]
- An animal tissue consisting of a small number of cells (e.g. fibroblasts and mast cells) and a large amount of extracellular matrix, including variable amounts of fibres (see collagen; Elastin). It is widely distributed and has many functions, including support, packing, defence, and repair. The individual constituents vary, depending on the function of the tissue. Different types of connective tissue include mesenchyme in the embryo, adipose tissue, areolar connective tissue, blood, lymph, cartilage, and bone.
