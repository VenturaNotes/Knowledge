- A relation $R$ defined on a set $S$ and having the property that, for all $x, y$, and $z$ in $S$, $$\begin{align}&\text{whenever }xRy \text{ and }yRz \\ &\text{then }xRz\end{align}$$The relations 'is less than' defined on integers, and 'is subset of' defined on sets are transitive.
## Source[^2]
- A relation, denoted by $R$, such that $A R B$ and $B R C$ imply $A R C$. The relations of equality, denoted $=$, and greater than, denoted $>$, are transitive. The transitivity of the relation 'at least as good as' is usually adopted as an axiom of consumer theory.
