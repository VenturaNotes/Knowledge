- central venous catheter an intravenous catheter for insertion directly into a large vein, most commonly the subclavian vein, during its passage under the clavicle, or the jugular in the neck. Such catheters can also be inserted into the femoral vein at the groin. They enable intravenous drugs and fluids to be given and intravenous pressures to be measured, which is often useful during operations or in intensive care. Central venous catheters must be inserted under strictly sterile conditions using a local anaesthetic.
