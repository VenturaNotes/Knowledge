- A US-based manufacturer of supercomputers, intended primarily for scientific and engineering applications. It was established in the mid-1950s by a group of engineers including Seymour Cray and for many years led the field with its 6600 and 7600 ranges of computers. It lost ground in the 1980s and began to look to other markets. In 1992 it split into two companies, Ceridian taking the noncomputer business and Control Data Systems Inc. taking the computer products. The latter is now part of BT Group plc.
