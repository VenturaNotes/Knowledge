- The system of accounting for depreciation on an asset by taking an assumed life, say $n$ years, and charging depreciation at the rate of $(1 / n)$ of its cost each year until it is fully written down. The system is so named because if the remaining value is plotted against time on a graph the result is a downward-sloping straight line.
