- The term data wiping is used to describe the removal of data from a computer device or network. For instance, if an IT professional was instructed to wipe a hard drive, then they would have to render all data on the hard drive unreadable. It's important to note that a data wipe differs from a data erasure because when data is erased, it can often be recovered by anyone with the appropriate know-how or recovery software. Typically data wipes are conducted using an overwrite program that gets rid of a file ªs original information by replacing it with other information. Most of the time when businesses upgrade or replace electronic devices in the workplace, they will conduct a data wipe on the devices that are to be replaced to ensure that any company data on those devices cannot be accessed by unauthorized parties.
