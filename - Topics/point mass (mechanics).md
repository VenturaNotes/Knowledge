- The simplifying assumption that all the mass of a body is concentrated at a single point. This can be a reasonable assumption, even when applied to a planet or star, as the gravitational potential outside a spherically symmetric massive body is indistinguishable from a point mass with the same total mass placed at the centre of the body.
