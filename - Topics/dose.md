- (in radiobiology) A measure of the extent to which matter has been exposed to ionizing radiation. The absorbed dose is the energy per unit mass absorbed by matter as a result of such exposure. The SI unit is the gray, although it is often measured in rads ( $1 ~\mathrm{rad}=$ 0.01 gray; see RADIATION UNITS). The maximum permissible dose is the recommended upper limit of absorbed dose that a person or organ should receive in a specified period according to the International Commission on Radiological Protection.
