- $n$. The basic unit or quantum of light or other electromagnetic radiation, considered as a particle with zero rest mass and energy equal to $h f$, where $h$ is Planck's constant ( $6.6262 \times 10^{-34}$ Joule seconds) and $f$ is the frequency (1) of the radiation in hertz. \[From Greek phos, photos light + -on by analogy with electron]
## Source[^2]
- A particle with zero rest mass consisting of a quantum of electromagnetic radiation. The photon may also be regarded as a unit of energy equal to $hf$, where $h$ is the Planck constant and $f$ is the frequency of the radiation in hertz. Photons travel at the speed of light. They are required to explain the photoelectric effect and other phenomena that require light to have particle character. The name photon was proposed by Gilbert Newton Lewis in 1926.
