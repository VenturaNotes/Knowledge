- The situation in which an economy slows down but does not go into a recession. The term was first used in astronautics journals of the late 1950s to describe a safe moon landing.

- A successful stabilization programme which restores price stability after a period of excess demand and inflation without provoking a recession in the process. The problem with achieving this is that if restrictive monetary and fiscal policy are not tight enough, the economy will not land at all, and inflation will continue; while if policies are too restrictive there will be a fall in demand before stability is restored. A hard landing occurs when there is a recession before stability is restored.
