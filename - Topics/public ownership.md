- Ownership of enterprises by the government, or by a government-controlled body. This may include direct operation by the central government, as for example with military establishments or the civil service; operation by local authorities, as with many public amenities, and in the UK local authority housing; and operation by government-appointed bodies, as with the UK National Health Service. It is also possible for the government to own part or all of the shares of companies.
