- Field service management (FSM) is a business function that improves field service management within an organization. It helps managers dispatch the right worker to the right location at the right time. For example, you can send an electrician with experience in working with construction companies to a job on a building site, or send a contractor with inventory management experience to a project that requires it. FSM involves hiring new contractors to fulfill a particular job requirement, interviewing workers about their skills or previous employment responsibilities, or monitoring field service employees remotely.
