- The derived series of a group G is defined recursively by $G_0 = G$ and $G_{i+1} = [G_i, G_i]$ where $[H, H]$ denotes the commutator subgroup of a group H. The derived series reaches $G_i = \{e\}$ for some $i$ if and only if $G$ is solvable. For $G = S_4$, then $G_1 = A_4,$ $G_2 = V_4,$ and $G_3 = \{e\}$
