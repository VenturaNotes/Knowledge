- n. 
- (1) (in embryology) the process in embryonic development during which unspecialized cells or tissues become specialized for particular functions. 
- (2) (in oncology) the degree of similarity of tumor cells to the structure of the organ from which the tumor arose. Tumors are classified as well, moderately, or poorly differentiated: well differentiated tumors appear similar to the cells of the organ in which they arose; poorly differentiated tumors do not. Such classification is often of prognostic significance and determines the grade of the tumor. Well-differentiated tumors are low-grade; poorly differentiated tumors are high-grade.
