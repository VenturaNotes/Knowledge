- A list of the holders of debentures in a UK company. There is no legal requirement for such a register to be kept but if one exists it must be kept at the company's registered office or at a place notified to the Registrar of Companies. It must be available for inspection, to debenture-holders and shareholders free of charge and to the public for a small fee.
