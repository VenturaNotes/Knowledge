- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a release or discharge of emotional energy following the recollection of a painful memory that has been repressed. It can occur spontaneously or during psychotherapy, especially under hypnosis, and may lead to catharsis. As a therapeutic procedure, it was discovered in 1880-82 by the Austrian physician Josef Breuer (1842-1925), and during the infancy of psychoanalysis it was believed to be therapeutic in itself. See also PRINCIPLE OF CONSTANCY. \[From German abreagieren to abreact or (metaphorically) let off steam, from Latin $a b$ from + German reagieren to respond, coined in 1893 by Breuer and Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) in an article 'On the Psychical Mechanism of Hysterical Phenomena: Preliminary Communication' (Standard Edition, II, pp. 3-17)]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the therapeutic release of strong emotion commonly associated with a buried memory. The therapist may help the patient to retrieve the memory (sometimes through hypnosis), which is accompanied by the release and discharge of tension and anxiety associated with it; this is supposed to rid the memory of its power. This intervention is now largely obsolete in psychological practice. See REPRESSION.
