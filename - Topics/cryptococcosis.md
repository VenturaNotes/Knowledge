- (torulosis) n. a disease of worldwide distribution, but recognized mainly in the USA, caused by the fungus Cryptococcus neoformans. The fungus attacks the lung, resulting in a tumour-like solid mass (toruloma), but produces few or no symptoms referable to the lungs. It may spread to the brain, leading to meningitis; this may occur as an opportunistic infection in those suffering from AIDS. The condition responds well to treatment with amphotericin.
