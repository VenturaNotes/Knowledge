## Source [^1]
- A list in which additional linkage structures, called threads, have been added to provide for traversals in special orders. This permits bounded workspace, i.e. read-only traversals along the direction provided by the threads. It does presuppose that the list and any sublists are not recursive and further that no sublist is shared.
