- IT Governance (or ITG) merges IT strategy with business strategy to provide a way for organizations to create and assess measurable IT goals. These goals are stacked up against the overall mission and goals of the business to ensure that the two align. IT Governance focuses on four crucial components: risk management, resource management, value delivery and strategic alignment. To evaluate the performance and effectiveness of ITG processes, many businesses opt to use an IT governance framework such as COBIT, AS8015-2005, and ISO/IEC 38500:2008. These frameworks also help ensure that any legal obligations or quality standards are met.
