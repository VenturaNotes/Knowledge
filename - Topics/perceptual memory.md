- $n$. Long-term memory for visual, auditory, and other perceptual information, including memory for people's faces and voices, the appearance of buildings, familiar tunes, the flavors of particular foods and drinks, and so on. Stored information of this type does not fall into the category of episodic memory, and it is therefore often included in semantic memory, but this is avoided in careful usage because it is not (and in some cases cannot be) encoded in words. It should not be confused with sensory memory.
