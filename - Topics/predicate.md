## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Example of a predicate:
	- x + 1 = 1
## Source[^2]
- It is something with a variable that becomes a logical statement if we set a value for x
	- Example: $x \in \mathbb{N}$

## Source[^3]
- A function from some domain to a truth value. If the domain comprises $n$ variables$$\text { where } n=0,1,2, \ldots$$the function is called an $n$-place predicate. In the special case where $n=0$, the predicate is a statement. Predicates are the fundamental building blocks of the predicate calculus.
