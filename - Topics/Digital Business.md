- Digital business involves creating new business processes by combining physical and digital worlds. That means using technologies in both digital and real-world environments to improve productivity, performance, and profitability. For example, a brick-and-mortar retailer might invest in payment processing tools to use in their stores and on their website. The blurring of the physical and digital means more companies are investing in technologies that serve customers in both real-world and online situations.
