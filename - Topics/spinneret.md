- A small tubular appendage from which silk is produced in spiders and some insects. Spiders have four to six spinnerets on the hind part of the abdomen, into which numerous silk glands open. The silk is secreted as a fluid and hardens on contact with the air. Various types of silk are produced depending on its use (e.g. for webs, egg cocoons, etc.). The spinnerets that produce the cocoons of insects are not homologous with those of spiders. For example, the spinneret of the silkworm is in the pharynx and the silk is produced by modified salivary glands.
