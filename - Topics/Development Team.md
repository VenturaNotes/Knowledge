## Synthesis
- Most commonly referred to as "developers" in the Scrum Guide.
	- #question What is the scrum guide?
- It is a self-organizing and cross-functional group of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable increment of "done" product at the end of each sprint. 
	- #question What does cross-functional mean? 
- They are responsible for creating the sprint backlog and managing their own work during the sprint.
	- #question Is the sprint backlog different from the product backlog which the owner handles? 
	- #question Even though they manage their own work during the sprint, why is the product owner or scrum master necessary then? Do managers not exist in this format?
