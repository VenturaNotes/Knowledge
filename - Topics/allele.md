## Source [^1]
- Alternative forms of a gene are called alleles
## Source[^2]
- $n$. Short for allelomorph, one of two or more alternative versions of a gene that can occupy a particular locus on a chromosome, each responsible for a different characteristic or phenotype, such as a different eye color. A pair of alleles are often represented by upper-case and lowercase forms of the same roman letter, such as $A$ and $a$. See also additive ALLELES, ANTIMORPH, BALANCED POLYMORPHISM, COMPLEMENTATION, DOMINANT GENE, EPISTASIS, GENETIC POLYMORPHISM, HARDY-WeINBERG LAW, HETEROZYGOUS, HOMOZYGOUS, RECESSIVE GENE, SEGREGATION OF ALLELES. \[From Greek allel one another]
## Source[^3]
- (allelomorph) $n$. one of two or more alternative forms of a gene, only one of which can be present in a chromosome. Two alleles of a particular gene occupy the same relative positions on a pair of homologous chromosomes. If the two alleles are the same, the individual is homozygous for the gene; if they are different he is heterozygous. See also DOMINANT; RECESSIVE. â€”allelic adj.
## Source[^4]
- (allelomorph) One of the alternative forms of a gene or any other particular site (locus) on a chromosome. In a diploid cell there are usually two alleles of any one gene (one from each parent), which occupy the same locus on homologous chromosomes. These alleles may be the same, or one allele may be dominant to the other (known as the recessive), i.e. it determines which aspects of a particular characteristic the organism will display. Alternatively, neither allele may be completely dominant (see incomplete DOMINANCE), or both alleles may be expressed fully (see CODOMINANCE). Within a population there may be numerous alleles of a gene; each has a unique nucleotide sequence.
