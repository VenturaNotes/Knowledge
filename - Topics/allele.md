## Source[^2]
- $n$. Short for allelomorph, one of two or more alternative versions of a gene that can occupy a particular locus on a chromosome, each responsible for a different characteristic or phenotype, such as a different eye color. A pair of alleles are often represented by upper-case and lowercase forms of the same roman letter, such as $A$ and $a$. See also additive ALLELES, ANTIMORPH, BALANCED POLYMORPHISM, COMPLEMENTATION, DOMINANT GENE, EPISTASIS, GENETIC POLYMORPHISM, HARDY-WeINBERG LAW, HETEROZYGOUS, HOMOZYGOUS, RECESSIVE GENE, SEGREGATION OF ALLELES. \[From Greek allel one another]
## Source[^3]
- (allelomorph) $n$. one of two or more alternative forms of a gene, only one of which can be present in a chromosome. Two alleles of a particular gene occupy the same relative positions on a pair of homologous chromosomes. If the two alleles are the same, the individual is homozygous for the gene; if they are different he is heterozygous. See also DOMINANT; RECESSIVE. â€”allelic adj.
