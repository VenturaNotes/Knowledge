- a chronic nonbacterial inflammation of the bladder accompanied by an urgent desire to pass urine frequently and bladder pain; it is sometimes associated with an ulcer in the bladder wall (Hunner's ulcer). The cause is unknown and contracture of the bladder eventually occurs. Treatment is by distension of the bladder under spinal or epidural anaesthetic, instillation of anti-inflammatory solutions into the bladder, and administration of steroids or NSAIDs. Bladder enhancement or augmentation (see CYSTOPLASTY) may be required for a contracted bladder.
