- A square matrix in which every element lying to one side of the main diagonal is equal to zero. Thus for a lower triangular matrix, $L$,

  

$$

l_{i j}=0 \text { if } i<j

$$

  

and for an upper triangular matrix, $U$,

  

$$

u_{i j}=0 \text { if } i>j

$$

  

if, in addition,

  

$$

l_{i i}=0 \text { or } u_{i i}=0

$$

  

then $L$ or $U$ is said to be strictly lower or strictly upper triangular respectively. The inverse of a lower (or an upper) triangular matrix, if it exists, is easy to calculate and is itself lower (or upper) triangular.
