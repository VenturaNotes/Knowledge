- $n$. something that is given voluntarily to someone, either in exchange or from an unselfish (altruistic) desire to help another. Patients may wish to thank their clinicians by giving a gift. However, some may see this as 'buying' future attention, and some health-service employers and authorities have introduced guidelines for staff: clinicians should be clear what they may and may not accept. Altruistic giving remains the way in which transplants or blood products are obtained in the NHS, and buying or selling organs is seen as a potential harm and so unethical and possibly illegal.
