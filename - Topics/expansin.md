- Any of a family of proteins that loosen the polymers of plant cell walls enabling expansion of the cells during growth and other developmental processes. They act by breaking the hydrogen bonds between cellulose microfibrils and other polysaccharides, allowing the cell wall components to slide relative to each other without disrupting the cell wall.
