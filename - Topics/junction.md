## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The area of contact between two semiconductor materials having different electric properties, or between a semiconductor and a metal. Junctions play a fundamental role in semiconductor devices. The most frequently used is the [[p-n junction]], which is formed between n-type and p-type semiconductors. A p-n junction has rectifying properties as a result of the potential barrier built up across the junction by the diffusion of electrons from the n-type to the p-type material.

- n. (in anatomy) the point at which two different tissues or structures are in contact. See also NEUROMUSCULAR JUNCTION.
