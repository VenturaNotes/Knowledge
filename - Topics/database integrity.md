- The condition of a database in which all data values are correct, in the sense (a) of reflecting the state of the real world$\textemdash$within given constraints of accuracy and timeliness$\textemdash$and (b) of obeying rules of mutual consistency. The maintenance of database integrity involves integrity checking, and recovery from any incorrect state that may be detected; this is the responsibility of database administration using the facilities of a database management system.
- File integrity can be defined in similar terms. Typically, however, files are subject to less extensive integrity checking than databases.
