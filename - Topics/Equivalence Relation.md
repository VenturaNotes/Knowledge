- A binary relation $\sim$ on a set S that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. For an equivalence relation $\sim$, $a$ is said to be equivalent to b when $a \sim b$. It is an important fact that, from an equivalence relation on $S$, equivalence classes can be defined to obtain a partition of S. Conversely, given any partition of S, an equivalence relation can be defined by $a \sim b$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ are in the same part of the partition.
