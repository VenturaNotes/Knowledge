- A binary relation $\sim$ on a set S that is reflexive, symmetric and transitive. For an equivalence relation $\sim$, $a$ is said to be equivalent to b when $a \sim b$. It is an important fact that, from an equivalence relation on $S$, equivalence classes can be defined to obtain a partition of S. Conversely, given any partition of S, an equivalence relation can be defined by $a \sim b$ if and only if $a$ and $b$ are in the same part of the partition.

- A relation that is transitive, symmetric, and reflexive. The concept is a convenient generalization or abstraction of equality. It covers most notions of equals, equivalence, and similarity as defined between triangles, algorithms, Boolean expressions, algebraic structures, statements, etc. See also EQUIVALENCE CLASS, PARTIAL ORDERING.
