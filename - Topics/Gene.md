## Source [^1]
- $n$. the basic unit of genetic material, which is carried at a particular place on a chromosome. Originally it was regarded as the unit of inheritance and mutation but is now usually defined as a sequence of DNA or RNA that acts as the unit controlling the formation of a single polypeptide chain (see CISTRON). In diploid organisms, including humans, genes occur as pairs of alleles. Various kinds of gene have been discovered: structural genes determine the biochemical makeup of the proteins; regulator genes control the rate of protein production (see OPERON). Architectural genes are responsible for the integration of the protein into the structure of the cell, and temporal genes control the time and place of action of the other genes and largely control the differentiation of the cells and tissues of the body.

- A unit of heredity composed of DNA. In classical genetics (see MENDELISM; MENDEL'S LAWS) a gene is visualized as a discrete particle, forming part of a chromosome, that determines a particular characteristic. It can exist in different forms called alleles, which determine which aspect of the characteristic is shown (e.g. tallness or shortness for the characteristic of height).
- A gene occupies a specific position (locus) on a chromosome. In view of the discoveries of molecular genetics, it may be defined as the sequence of nucleotides of DNA (or RNA) concerned with a specific function, such as the synthesis of a single polypeptide chain or of an RNA molecule, corresponding to a particular sequence of the genetic code. One or more of these structural genes, coding for protein, may be associated with other genes controlling their expression (see OPERON). Only about $1.5 \%$ of human genes encode proteins, although about $75 \%$ of the genome is transcribed, at least on some occasions. Much of this gives rise to various types of non-protein-coding RNA, now thought to play crucial roles in controlling the expression of structural genes. See also CISTRON.
