- $n$. A syllabic writing system, used in conjunction with kanji in Japanese writing. It consists of two written forms: hiragana, used to express particles and grammatical distinctions, is based on Chinese cursive script and is widely used in newspapers and general literature, and katakana, an angular script based mainly on Chinese logographs, is used mainly for loan words and foreign words. See also KANJI. \[Japanese: literally borrowed or provisional characters, distinguishing them from kanji, regarded as real characters]
