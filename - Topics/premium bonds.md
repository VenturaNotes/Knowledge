No regular income or capital gain is offered but bonds enter monthly draws for a range of tax-free prizes, winners being drawn by ERNIE (electronic random number indicating equipment). Bonds are in $£ 1$ denominations with a minimum purchase of $£ 100$ and a maximum holding of $£ 30,000$. Bonds are repaid at their face value at any time.
