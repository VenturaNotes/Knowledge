- A real (or complex) sequence $\left\{a_{n}\right\}$ is Cauchy if $\left|a_{n}-a_{m}\right|$ tends to 0 as $m, n$ tend to infinity. A real (or complex) sequence is Cauchy if and only if it is convergent. The definition has the merit of implying convergence without explicit knowledge of the limit. Generally, in a metric space, Cauchy sequences can be defined using the distance $d\left(a_{n}, a_{m}\right)$ instead. See COMPLETE METRIC SPACE.
