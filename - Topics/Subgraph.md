- A portion of a graph $G$ obtained by either eliminating edges from $G$ and/or eliminating some vertices and their associated edges. Formally a subgraph of a graph $G$ with vertices $V$ and edges $E$ is a graph $G^{\prime}$ with vertices $V^{\prime}$ and edges $E^{\prime}$ in which $V^{\prime}$ is a subset of $V$ and $E^{\prime}$ is a subset of $E$ (edges in $E^{\prime}$ joining vertices in $V^{\prime}$ ).

  

If $V^{\prime}$ is a proper subset of $V$ or $E^{\prime}$ is a proper subset of $E$ then $G^{\prime}$ is a proper subgraph of $G$. If all the vertices of $G$ are present in the subgraph $G^{\prime}$ then $G^{\prime}$ is a [[spanning subgraph]] of $G$. See also SPANNING TREE.
