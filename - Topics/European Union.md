- (EU) The 28 nations that have joined together to form an economic community, with common monetary, political, and social aspirations. The EU was created in 1993 from the European Community (EC), which itself grew from the European Coal and Steel Community, the European Atomic Energy Community, and the European Economic Community. The 12 nations of the EC (Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the UK) were joined by Austria, Sweden, and Finland in 1995, by (Greek) Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia in 2004, by Bulgaria and Romania in 2007, and by Croatia in 2013. Its executive body is the European Commission, which was formed in 1967 with the Council of the European Communities. EU policy emerges from a dialogue between the Commission, which initiates and implements the policy, and the Council, which takes the major policy decisions. The European Parliament, formed in 1957, exercises democratic control over policy, and the European Court of Justice imposes the rule of law on the EU, as set out in its various treaties. A draft EU Constitution, providing for the creation of an EU president and foreign minister, was published in 2004 but rejected by the electorates of France and the Netherlands. Elements of the proposed constitution were, however, retained in a treaty agreed in October 2007 (the Lisbon Treaty), In a referendum held in June 2016 the UK electorate voted to leave the European Union. See European Economic and Monetary Union.

The EU was formed with twelve members: Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom. Austria, Finland, and Sweden joined in 1995. Ten more countries joined in 2004 (Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia). Bulgaria and Romania joined in 2007 and Croatia in 2013. Albania, Montenegro, Serbia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and Turkey are currently official candidate countries for membership. Additionally, the western Balkan countries of Bosnia and Herzegovina and Kosovo are officially recognized as potential candidates. In a national referendum in June 2016 the UK voted to leave the EU, a process that will take at least two years and which will cause major upheaval for the EU.
