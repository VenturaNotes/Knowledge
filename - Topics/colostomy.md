- $n$. a surgical operation in which a part of the colon is brought through the anterior abdominal wall and an artificial opening is created in order to drain or decompress the contents of colon. The part of the colon chosen depends on the site of obstruction or the underlying disease process. Depending on the indication a colostomy may be temporary, eventually being closed after months or years to restore intestinal continuity; or permanent, when the colon distal to the colostomy has been removed or is diseased. A bag is worn over the colostomy opening (stoma) to collect the faeces for disposal.
