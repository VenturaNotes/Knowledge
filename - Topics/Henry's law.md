- At a constant temperature the mass of gas dissolved in a liquid at equilibrium is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. The law, discovered in 1801 by the British chemist and physician William Henry (1775–1836), is a special case of the partition law. It applies only to gases that do not react with the solvent.
