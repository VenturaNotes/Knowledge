- $n$. A series of bird calls each followed by a rapid antiphonal response from a mating partner, functioning as a recognition and bonding signal. It is often mistaken for the song of a single bird, as by William Shakespeare (1564-1616) in Love's Labour Lost (V.ii.903) when he attributed tu-whit, tu-who to a single staring owl.
