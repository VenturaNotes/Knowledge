- $n$. an instrument (endoscope) used for examining the interior of the kidney, usually passed into the renal pelvis through a track from the skin surface after needle nephrostomy and dilatation of the tract over a guidewire. The nephroscope allows the passage of instruments under direct vision to remove calculi (see PERCUTANEOUS NEPHROLITHOTOMY), or to disintegrate them using ultrasound probes or pneumatic energy via a lithoclast, or a combination of the two.
