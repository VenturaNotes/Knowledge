- visible sebaceous glands present in most individuals. They are 1-3-mm painless papules that may be noticed on the scrotum, shaft of the penis, labia, and inner surface and border of the lips. They become more visible from puberty onwards and are easier to see when the skin is stretched. Completely harmless, they are not sexually transmitted or infectious and do not require any treatment. \[J. A. Fordyce (1858-1925), US dermatologist]
