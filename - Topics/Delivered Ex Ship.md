- (DES) An Incoterm denoting an export contract in which the seller pays all freight and insurance charges up to the port of destination. If the seller also agrees to pay for lighterage and unloading this is correctly styled a Delivered Ex Quay (DEQ) contract. In a DES or DEQ contract, unlike a Cost, Insurance and Freight Contract (see Cost and FreIGHT), risk passes to the buyer at the port of destination, not that of shipment.
