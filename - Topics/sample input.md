- Input in computer graphics where the input device continually updates the required input value and the application samples it when it requires it. An example of the use of sample input would be a dial that the operator rotates to define the orientation of a molecule. The application is in a loop whereby it updates the molecule position, samples the new dial position, and repeats the drawing of the molecule.
