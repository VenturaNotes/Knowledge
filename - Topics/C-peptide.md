- n. a peptide (so-called because of its C shape) formed when insulin is produced from its precursor molecule, proinsulin. It is secreted in equal molar amounts to insulin. However, as it remains detectable in the plasma much longer than insulin it can be more easily assayed as a marker of the degree of insulin secretion. This can be useful to assess the ability of the pancreas to secrete insulin, for example when trying to determine whether somebody has type 1 or type 2 diabetes or to distinguish an insulinsecreting tumor (an insulinoma) from surreptitious insulin usage in somebody presenting with unexplained hypoglycaemia.
