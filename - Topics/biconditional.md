| Biconditional [[Truth Table]]                     |
- A biconditional is when the truth values of both sides coincide (meaning both true or both false), for this logical statement A $\leftrightarrow$ B to be true
- ![[Screenshot 2024-12-12 at 8.13.37 AM.png]][^2]
- $A \leftrightarrow B \iff (A \to B) \land (B \to A)$
	- The double sided arrow ($\iff$) means there is a [[tautology]] as the truth values of both sides coincide

## Source[^3]
- A logical statement combining two statements, truth values, or formulas $P$ and $Q$ in such a way that the outcome is true only if $P$ and $Q$ are both true or both false, as indicated in the table.

  

The biconditional connective can be represented by

  

$$

\nabla \leftrightarrow \Longleftrightarrow \text { or } \Longrightarrow

$$

  

and is read as 'if and only if' or 'iff' or 'is equivalent to'. Note that $P \equiv Q$ has the same truth table as the conjunction

  

$$

(P \rightarrow Q) \wedge(Q \rightarrow P)

$$

  

where $\rightarrow$ denotes a simple conditional. The biconditional connective itself is also known as the biconditional.

## Source[^4]
- $n$. In logic and mathematics, a statement of the form $p$ if and only if $q$. This means that $q$ is a necessary and sufficient condition of $p$, and it is sometimes written $p$ iff $q$. An example is: A number is prime iff it can be evenly divided only by itself and 1. It is called a biconditional because it is equivalent to the double (bi-) statement If $p$ then $q$ and if $q$ then $p$. A biconditional is true if both of its component statements are true or if both are false, and otherwise it is false.
