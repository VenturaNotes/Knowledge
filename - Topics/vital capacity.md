- the maximum volume of air that a person can exhale after maximum inhalation. It is usually measured on an instrument called a spirometer.
## Source[^2]
- The total amount of air that can be exhaled after maximum inspiration. The vital capacity of an average human is typically $4.5\text{-}5$ litres; in trained male athletes it can be 6 litres or more. However, some air always remains in the lungs (see RESIDUAL VOLUME). Hence, the total lung capacity is the sum of vital capacity and residual volume.
