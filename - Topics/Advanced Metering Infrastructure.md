- Advanced metering infrastructure (AMI), used by utility companies, is an integrated system of equipment (such as smart meters and sensors), communications networks, and information management systems. The system enables two-way communication between utilities and customers. AMI provides the ability to automatically and remotely measure energy or water use, connect/disconnect service, detect tampering, monitor voltage, and identify outages or leaks. The four main components include meters, meter interface unit for data storage and transmission, other sensors, and remotely controlled variables.
