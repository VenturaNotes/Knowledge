- The changes that need to take place in the eye when an animal moves from a brightly lit environment to a relatively dark one to enable objects to be seen clearly. On moving to a darker environment, the pupils dilate and rhodopsin—the pigment in the rod cells that is broken down in bright light—is regenerated from its constituents.

- the changes that take place in the retina and pupil of the eye enabling vision in very dim light. Dark adaptation involves activation of the rods - the cells of the retina that function best in dim light - and the reflex enlargement of the pupil (see PUPILLARY REFLEX). Compare LIGHT ADAPTATION.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A form of adaptation (2) in which the visual system is adjusted for efficient response in dim illumination, the pupil dilating and the absolute threshold for vision gradually decreasing with time spent in the dark, the threshold for red, orange, and yellow objects or images attaining its minimum after about 5 minutes, and the threshold for green, blue, and violet also decreasing to a plateau after about 5 minutes but then declining again from about 10 minutes and approaching its minimum after about 25 minutes, this dual or duplexity function being due to the different adaptation rates of the photopic and scotopic systems. See also field adaptation, photochromatic interval, Purkinje shift. Compare light adaptation. dark-adapted adj. Of or relating to the eye or the visual system after it has undergone dark adaptation.
