- The changes that need to take place in the eye when an animal moves from a brightly lit environment to a relatively dark one to enable objects to be seen clearly. On moving to a darker environment, the pupils dilate and rhodopsin—the pigment in the rod cells that is broken down in bright light—is regenerated from its constituents.

- the changes that take place in the retina and pupil of the eye enabling vision in very dim light. Dark adaptation involves activation of the rods - the cells of the retina that function best in dim light - and the reflex enlargement of the pupil (see PUPILLARY REFLEX). Compare LIGHT ADAPTATION.
