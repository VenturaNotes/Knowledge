- (1) (of a set $S$ on which the partial ordering $<$ is defined) An element $u$ with the property that $s<u$ for all $s$ in $S$. Also $u$ is a [[least upper bound]] if, for any other upper bound $v, u<v$.
- Since numerical computing demands the truncation of infinite arithmetic to finite arithmetic, the computation of least upper bounds of real numbers, indeed of any limit, can only be achieved to a machine tolerance, usually defined to be machine precision: the smallest epsilon eps, such that$$1.0+\text { eps }>1.0$$in computer arithmetic. See also LOWER BOUND. 
- (2) (of a matrix or vector) See ARRAY.
