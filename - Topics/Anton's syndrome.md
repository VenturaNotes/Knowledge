- $n$. A rare form of anosognosia in which a person who is totally blind, usually as a result of extensive damage to the visual cortex or the optic nerves, is unaware of the blindness, typically either guessing at the appearance of objects from non-visual cues while believing that they are being perceived visually, or believing that for some reason the surroundings are plunged in darkness. Also called blindness denial. Compare Blindsight (which may be interpreted as the inverse of Anton's syndrome). \[Named after the Czech neurologist and psychiatrist Gabriel Anton (1858-1933) who first described it in a case study published in 1899 in the journal Wiener klinische Wochenschrift, translated into English in the journal Cognitive Neuropsychology in 1993]
