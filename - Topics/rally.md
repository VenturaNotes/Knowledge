- A rise in prices in a financial market, after a fall. This is usually brought about by a change of market sentiment. However, if the change has occurred because there are more buyers than sellers, it is known as a technical rally. For example, unfavourable sentiment might cause a market to fall, in turn causing sellers to withdraw at the lower prices. The market will then be sensitive to the presence of very few buyers, who, if they show their hand, may bring about a technical rally.
