- $n$. A laboratory measure of aggression in response to provocation, developed by the US psychiatrist Don (Donald Raymond) Cherek (born 1941) and published in the journal Psychopharmacology in 1981. In a slightly revised version that Cherek developed into a computer program in 1992, subjects can earn money by pressing a button marked $A$, take money from opponents with whom they believe that they are paired by pressing $B$, or protect their earned money by pressing $C$. Buttons can be pressed repeatedly, and a participant's accumulated earnings are displayed on the computer screen throughout the task. Irrespective of the participant's actions, the fictitious opponent periodically deducts money from the participant's account. From the participant's pattern of button-pressing, it is possible to determine the level of aggression in response to provocation. Compare hot sauce task, Taylor AGGRESSION PARADIGM. PSAP abbrev.
