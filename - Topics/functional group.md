- A group of atoms having specific chemical properties, which it confers on larger molecules to which the group attaches. Common examples in biologically important molecules include hydroxyl, carbonyl (found in ketones and aldehydes), carboxyl, amino, sulfhydryl, and phosphate groups. The number and nature of such groups influences the shape of any large biomolecule, as well as how it interacts with other molecules.
