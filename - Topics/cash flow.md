- Cash flow is the amount of cash received less the amount spent by a business or a household for a given accounting period. For a business, this is recorded in a cash flow statement that shows all sources and uses of cash from one period to the next and serves as a measure of the short-term financial health of the business. A major responsibility of the finance director of any business is to forecast its cash flow, on both current and capital account, and to ensure that the timing of receipts and payments is such that money is always available to meet any payments that have to be made. See also DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW.

- (1) The movement of cash in and out of a business. A cash-flow statement shows the inflows and outflows of cash and cash equivalents for a business over an accounting period under various set headings (operating activities; investing activities; financing activities). The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland requires nearly all companies to publish a cash-flow statement in their annual accounts. A cash-flow projection (or cash budget) sets out all the expected payments and receipts in a given period. This is different from the projected profit and loss account and, in times of cash shortage, may be more important. It is on the basis of the cash-flow projection that managers may arrange appropriate financing facilities and may also arrange for employees and creditors to be paid at appropriate times. See also DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW; FREE CASH FLOW. 
- (2) The net income from a particular transaction after all cash expenses have been met (non-cash expenses such as depreciation being specifically excluded from the calculation).
