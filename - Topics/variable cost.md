- An item of expenditure that, in total, varies directly with the level of activity achieved. For example, direct materials cost will tend to double if output doubles, a characteristic being that it is incurred as a constant rate per unit. In practice, there are few examples of true variable costs or true fixed costs, most costs being semi-variable costs.
