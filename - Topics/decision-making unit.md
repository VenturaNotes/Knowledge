- (DMU) The informal group of individuals within an organization that decides which items the organization should buy. Commercial buying is undertaken by a group of people, rather than by individuals; it is important for the seller to discover the composition of this group within each of his potential customers, and to recognize that membership changes periodically. The group's composition varies according to the cost and complexity of the item being bought, but might comprise: the company's purchasing manager, the proposed user of the item (the internal user), the influencer (one or more people, such as the production scheduler, indirectly associated with the use of the item), and the decider (one or more people, such as a director, who authorize the purchase).
