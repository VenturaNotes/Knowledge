- (joint hypermobility) a common condition in which joints can be moved beyond the normal range of motion. Most people with hypermobility have no other symptoms. However, those with joint hypermobility syndrome may suffer many difficulties due to laxity of the ligaments as the joints may sprain or dislocate. This can lead to weakened joints, muscle fatigue, and chronic pain. Joint hypermobility syndrome may be symptomatic of a more serious underlying medical condition, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome.
