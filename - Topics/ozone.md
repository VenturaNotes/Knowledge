- $n$. a poisonous gas containing three oxygen atoms per molecule. Ozone is a very powerful oxidizing agent and is formed when oxygen or air is subjected to electric discharge. Ozone in the troposphere (the atmospheric layer closest to the earth's surface), as found in photochemical smog, can cause health problems. Ozone at very high altitudes (the ozone layer) is responsible for absorbing a large proportion of the sun's ultraviolet radiation. Without this absorption by ozone the earth would be subjected to a lethal amount of ultraviolet radiation.
