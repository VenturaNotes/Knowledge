- a test to determine whether a person is susceptible to diphtheria. A small quantity of diphtheria toxin is injected under the skin; a patch of reddening and swelling shows that the person has no immunity and $\textendash$ if at particular risk $\textendash$ should be immunized. With safer toxoids, this test is no longer necessary. \[B. Schick (1877-1967), US paediatrician]
