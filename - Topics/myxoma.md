- n. a benign gelatinous tumor of connective tissue. Atrial myxoma is a tumor of the heart, usually of the left side, arising from the septum dividing the two upper chambers. Symptoms may include fever, lassitude, joint pains, and sudden loss of consciousness due to obstruction of the bloodflow. The tumour may be wrongly diagnosed as stenosis of the mitral valve as it can produce a similar murmur. Treatment requires surgical removal. $\textemdash$myxomatous adj.
