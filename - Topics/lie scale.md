- $n$. In psychometrics, a set of items included in a test to provide an indication of the extent to which the respondent has answered truthfully in other parts of the test. Some lie scales consist of repetitions of the same or closely similar items, to check for consistency of responses; others are made up of items to which certain responses may be assumed to be evidence of social desirability response set, or some other response bias, for example I always smile at strangers in the street (True) or I never regret things that I have said (True); and there are other more devious and subtle types of lie scales.
