- (DHEA) n. a weak androgen produced and secreted by the adrenal glands after the stage of adrenal maturation known as adrenarche. It is produced from 17-hydroxypregnenolone and itself is largely converted to dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate and androstenedione. All three of these molecules can cause a degree of mild androgenization but can also be converted in the circulation to the more potent androgens testosterone and dihydrotestosterone.
