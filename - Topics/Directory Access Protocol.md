- Directory access protocol (DAP) is a computer and internet standard. It is an older one, having first been promulgated in 1988. At the time, it was used to access X.500 directory services by client computer systems. The use of X.500 directory services gave client computers the ability to access a variety of other electronic devices and directories.
