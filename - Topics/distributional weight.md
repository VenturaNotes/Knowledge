- The relative importance given to different members of a society in the evaluation of social welfare. As an example, let the utility level of consumer $h$ be denoted $U^{h}$ and define the social welfare function$$W=\sum_{h=1}^{H} \alpha^{h} U^{h}$$The value of $\alpha^{h}$ is the distributional weight given to consumer $h$. The higher is the value of $\alpha^{h}$ relative to the values for other consumers, the more important is the utility of $h$ in the calculation of social welfare. For the utilitarian social welfare function all the distributional weights are equal and are usually normalized to 1 . For the Rawlsian, or maximin, social welfare function the distributional weights are equal to 0 for all consumers except the consumer with the lowest utility level who is assigned a weight of 1 .
