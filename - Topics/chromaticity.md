- The color quality of light that is defined by its dominant wavelength and purity.

- $n$. The quality of color or light in terms of the purity of its dominant wavelength, involving both hue and saturation (1). The chromaticity coordinates of a color are the three tristimulus values, symbolized by $x, y$, and $z$, representing the proportions of the three additive primaries that when mixed match the given color. Also called chromaticness. See also primary color $(1,2,3)$.
