- a condition in which amniotic fluid enters the maternal circulation causing a complex cascade similar to that seen in anaphylactic and septic shock. It is a rare event ( 1 in 50,000-100,000 deliveries), with a $60-80 \%$ maternal mortality. The sudden onset of cardiopulmonary collapse, together with coma or seizures, in labour or shortly after delivery, should prompt the diagnosis. Most of the women who survive have permanent neurological damage.
