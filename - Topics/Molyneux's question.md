The question regarding how the world would look to a person who acquired the gift of sight late in life, and in particular whether such a person would at first be able to distinguish a globe (ball) from a cube by sight alone. The English philosopher John Locke (1632-1704), a proponent of empiricism, hypothesized in 1690 that the answer was no: 'For, though he has obtained the experience of how a globe, how a cube affects his touch, yet he has not yet obtained the experience that what affects his touch so or so must affect his sight so or so' (Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Book 2, Chapter 9, section 8), but research into cross-modal transfer in the 1960s proved him wrong. \[Named after the Irish philosopher, astronomer, and politician William Molyneux (1656-98), referred to by Locke as 'the learned and worthy Mr Molineux' \[sic], who first posed the question to Locke in 1688]
