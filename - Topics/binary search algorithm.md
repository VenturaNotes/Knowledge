- (logarithmic search algorithm, bisection algorithm) A searching algorithm that uses a file in which the sortkeys are in ascending order. The middle key in the file is examined and, depending upon whether this is less than or greater than the desired key, the top or bottom part of the file is again examined. Continuing in this way the algorithm either finds the desired record or discovers its absence from the file. Thus the algorithm treats the file as though it were a binary search tree.
