- (logarithmic search algorithm, bisection algorithm) A searching algorithm that uses a file in which the sortkeys are in ascending order. The middle key in the file is examined and, depending upon whether this is less than or greater than the desired key, the top or bottom part of the file is again examined. Continuing in this way the algorithm either finds the desired record or discovers its absence from the file. Thus the algorithm treats the file as though it were a binary search tree.

- Used to search a list to see if it contains a particular item and to locate it if it does. The list needs to be in alphabetical (or some other) order, and the binary search algorithm identifies the middle term in the list and compares it with the search item. If it is the same the search is complete; if not it identifies the half of the list in which the item would be, and the other half is discarded. The process is repeated until the item is located or the list consists of only one item, in which case the item was not contained in the original list.
