- Control objectives for information and related technology (COBIT) is a framework for IT governance and management. COBIT was created in the early 1990s by the Information Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA). The goal of COBIT is to help organizations create a practical IT governance framework that will ensure the safety, security, and integrity of their information systems. COBIT is broken down into five core domains. These include Governance and Management Framework, Business Model for Information Security, Information Risk Management, Organizational Resilience, and Technology Infrastructure Management.
