- A firm specializing in the collection of debts on behalf of other firms. Such firms need skills in tracing the addresses of debtors, discovering whether they have concealed assets, and bringing pressure to bear to make debtors who can pay do so. This may involve legal proceedings, or publicity, to make it more difficult for defaulters to obtain credit from other lenders.
