- Effects by which the reactivity at one part of a molecule is affected by electron attraction or repulsion originating in another part of a molecule. Often this is called an inductive effect (or resonance effect), although sometimes the term ‘inductive effect’ is reserved for an influence transmitted through chemical bonds and is distinguished from a field effect, which is transmitted through space. An inductive effect through chemical bonds was formerly called a mesomeric effect (or mesomerism) or an electromeric effect. It is common to refer to all effects (through bonds or through space) as resonance effects.
