- An ancestral trait that is shared by two or more modern groups. Because of their ancient origin, symplesiomorphies are not usually helpful in assessing more recent evolutionary relationships within a larger group. For example, the simple leaves of some modern flowering plants are probably inherited from simple-leaved ancestors. But this does not mean that all simple-leaved modern plants are closely related. See PLESIOMORPHY.
