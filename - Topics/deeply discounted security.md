- A loan stock or government security issued at a discount of more than $15 \%$ of the amount on redemption or, where it is held for more than 30 years, at a discount of more than $1 / 2 \%$ for each completed year between issue and redemption. The discount will normally be treated as income accruing over the life of the stock and charged to income tax on sale or redemption. For example, a deep-discount bond might be a four-year loan stock issued at $£ 95$ for every $£ 100$ nominal (the discount exceeds $1 / 2 \%$ per annum) or a 25 -year loan stock issued at $£ 75$ for every $£ 100$ nominal (the discount exceeds $15 \%$ in total).
