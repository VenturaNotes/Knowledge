## Source [^1]
- a form of behavior therapy that is used to reduce the occurrence of undesirable behavior, such as sexual deviations or drug addiction. Conditioning is used, with repeated pairing of some unpleasant stimulus with a stimulus related to the undesirable behaviour. An example is the use of disulfiram in the treatment of alcoholism. Aversion therapy is little used nowadays. See also SENSITIZATION.
