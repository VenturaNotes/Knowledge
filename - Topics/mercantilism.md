- An economic theory popular in the 16th to 18th centuries that viewed a nation's supply of capital as the determinant of welfare. When this view was coupled with the assumption that the total value of world trade was fixed it implied a policy of seeking balance-of-payments surpluses to increase capital inflow, and advocacy of protectionism to achieve this.
