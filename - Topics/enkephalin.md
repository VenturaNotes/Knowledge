- (encephalin) Any of a class of endogenous opioids consisting of five amino acids and found principally in the central nervous system. They bind to opioid receptors, chiefly in the brain, and their release controls levels of pain and other sensations, for example by blocking the release of substance P, a neurotransmitter involved in nociception. Enkephalins themselves can act as neurotransmitters in the brain. See also DYnORPHIN; ENDORPHIN.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. Either of two major endogenous opioid peptides, metenkephalin and leu-enkephalin, occurring naturally in the brain in small quantities and functioning as both hormones and neurotransmitters, binding to opiate receptors and blocking pain sensations, the other major families of brain opiates being dynorphin and endorphin. \[From Greek en in + kephale head + -$i n(e)$ indicating an organic compound]
