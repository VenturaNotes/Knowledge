- A programming team in which responsibility for program design and implementation rests entirely with one highly skilled member, the chief programmer. The other team members provide various forms of support. A typical team could consist of the chief programmer, a backup programmer, librarian, administrator, and secretary: the backup programmer assists the chief programmer and is able to take over that role if necessary; the librarian maintains all technical documents on the project, such as design documents, source modules (in all versions), and test histories; the administrator relieves the chief programmer of all administrative duties on the project. Various other services might be obtained from outside the team as needed.
- This team organization has been advocated for the production of large programs: a single highly skilled programmer, when properly supported, can produce programs more quickly and more reliably than a team of less talented programmers working as equals. In particular, the problem of communication within the team is minimized.
- The approach was pioneered in the early 1970s by the Federal Systems Division of IBM, particularly by Harlan D. Mills.
