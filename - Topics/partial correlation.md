- A measure of the degree of linear relationship between two variables after the effect of other variables has been removed.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. In statistics, a correlation between two variables with the effect of a third variable controlled or partialled out. For example, if $x, y$, and $z$ represent the heights, weights, and ages of children, respectively, then a significant positive correlation between $x$ and $y$ may be due in part to the correlation of each of these variables with $z$. A partial correlation coefficient between $x$ and $y$ with $z$ partialled out, written $r_{\mathrm{xy}, \mathrm{z}}$, shows the degree of linear relationship between height and weight irrespective of age.
