- In a linear regression model, a test of the null hypothesis of homoscedasticity against the alternative hypothesis that the variance of observation $i$ has the form $\sigma_i^2 = h(z_i'\alpha)$, where $h$ is a function common for all $i, z_i$ is an $(S \times 1)$ non-stochastic vector with first element equal to one, and $\alpha$ is an $(S \times 1)$ vector of unknown coefficients. The test can be conveniently performed by $(1)$ estimating the original regression by ordinary least squares (OLS) and (2) regressing squared OLS residuals on $Z = (z_1, ..., z_N)$. The test statistic is $\eta = NR^2$, where $N$ is the sample size and $R^2$ is the coefficient of determination from the second regression. Under the null hypothesis, $\eta$ has asymptotically chi-square distribution with ($S-1$) degrees of freedom; this result does not depend on the function $h$
