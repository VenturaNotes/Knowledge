- signs or symptoms occurring in a patient with cancer that result from antibodies or ectopic hormones produced by the cancer and are not due directly to local effects of the cancer cells. Examples are myasthenia gravis secondary to a tumour of the thymus, a cerebellar syndrome in patients with lung cancer (due to anti-Purkinje cell antibody), and a peripheral neuropathy in patients with breast cancer. Removal of the cancer usually leads to resolution of the problem.
