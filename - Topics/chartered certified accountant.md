- A member of the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants. The Association's members are trained in industry, in the public sector, and in the offices of practising accountants. Membership is granted on the basis of completion of the Association's examinations and of sufficient relevant work experience. Members are recognized by the UK Department for Business, Innovation and Skills as qualified to audit the accounts of companies. They may be associates (ACCA) or fellows (FCCA) of the Association and, although they are not chartered accountants, they fulfil much the same role. Chartered certified accountants were known as certified accountants until 1996. In the USA the equivalent is a certified public accountant (CPA).
