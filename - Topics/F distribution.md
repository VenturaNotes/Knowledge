- An important probability distribution used to test the significance of estimated mean squares in an analysis of variance and in regression analysis. Theoretically the F distribution is the distribution of the ratio of two independent random variables $S_{1} \backslash f_{1}$ and $S_{2} \backslash f_{2}$, where $S_{1}$ has the chi-squared distribution on $f_{1}$ degrees of freedom and $S_{2}$ has the chi-squared distribution on $f_{2}$ degrees of freedom. Tables of critical values of the F distribution for ranges of $f_{1}$ and $f_{2}$ are widely available, but direct computation requires lengthy algorithms to compute the incomplete beta function.
