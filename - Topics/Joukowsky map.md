- The Joukovski map, or transform, is the map $z = \zeta + \zeta^{-1}$ from the complex plane to itself. The map has the property that a circle in the $\zeta$-plane, not centered at zero, is mapped to an aerofoil shape in the z-plane as shown in the figures. The map was instrumental in the early study of flight.
