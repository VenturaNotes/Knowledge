- inhalation of regurgitated stomach contents by an anaesthetized patient, which may result in death from anoxia or cause extensive lung damage or pulmonary oedema with severe bronchospasm. It is a well-recognized hazard of general anaesthesia in obstetrics and may be prevented by giving gastric-acid inhibitors (e.g. cimetidine or ranitidine) or sodium citrate before inducing anaesthesia. \[C. L. Mendelson (1913-2002), US obstetrician]
