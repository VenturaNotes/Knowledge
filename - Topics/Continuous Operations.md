- Continuous operations refer to the ability of data processing systems to operate without interruptions or downtime 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Certain aspects of the system help prevent scheduled maintenance and other planned downtime. The benefit of constant operations is that it can lead to lower costs, higher outputs, and better quality control.
