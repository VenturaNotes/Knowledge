- abbrev. The first major negative deflection in an event-related potential or an average evoked potential, occurring about 140 milliseconds after the onset of the stimulus. Some researchers have claimed that either its magnitude, or the acuteness of the angle between the N140 and the P200, correlates with IQ, but empirical findings are inconsistent. Also called the N140 potential or N140 wave. Compare string length. \[From n(egative) 140 (milliseconds)]
