- a monodelusional disorder in which patients believe they or their environment are infested by living or non-living pathogens. These can range from rats in the patient's house to microspores in the air. Most commonly, patients claim they are infested with insects, worms, parasites, mites, or inanimate threads or fibres, often underneath their skin. Many present the alleged parasite as a specimen for examination. If compliance can be established, most patients respond well to antipsychotic medication. The term delusional infestation was first introduced by Roland W. Freudenmann and Peter Lepping in 2009, and has gradually superseded the terms delusional parasitosis and Ekbom's syndrome.
