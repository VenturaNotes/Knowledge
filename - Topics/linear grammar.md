- A grammar in which each production contains at most one nonterminal in its right-hand side. Such a grammar is right-linear if a nonterminal can only occur as the rightmost symbol, i.e. if each production has one of the forms$$\begin{aligned}& A \rightarrow w \\& A \rightarrow w B\end{aligned}$$where $A$ and $B$ are nonterminals and $w$ is a string of terminals. A left-linear grammar can be similarly defined:$$\begin{aligned}& A \rightarrow w \\& A \rightarrow B w\end{aligned}$$The right- and left-linear grammars generate precisely the regular languages. 
- The word linear relates to an analogy with ordinary algebra. For example, a [[right-linear grammar]] such as$$\begin{aligned}& S \rightarrow aS|abT|abcT|abcd  \\& T \rightarrow S|cS|bcT|abc|abcd \end{aligned}$$corresponds to the simultaneous linear equations$$\begin{aligned}& X=\{a\}  X \cup\{a b, a b c\} Y \cup\{a b c d\} \\& Y=\{\Lambda, c\} X \cup\{b c\} Y \cup\{a b c, a b c d\}\end{aligned}$$where $X$ and $Y$ are sets of strings and $\Lambda$ is the empty string. Union and concatenation play roles analogous to addition and multiplication. The smallest solution to the equations gives the language generated by the grammar. See Arden's rule.
