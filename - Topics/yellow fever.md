- an infectious disease, caused by an arbovirus, occurring in tropical Africa and the northern regions of South America. It is transmitted by mosquitoes, principally AÃ«des aegypti. The virus causes degeneration of the tissues of the liver and kidneys. Symptoms, depending on severity of infection, include chill, headache, pains in the back and limbs, fever, vomiting, constipation, a reduced flow of urine (which contains high levels of albumin), and jaundice. The more serious cases may prove fatal, but recovery from a first attack confers subsequent immunity. The disease is treated by fluid replacement and can be prevented by vaccination.
