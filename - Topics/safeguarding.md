- $n$. measures put in place to protect the health, wellbeing, and human rights of children and vulnerable adults, thereby securing them from harm, abuse, and neglect. In Britain this includes legislation, official guidance, and standards laid down by institutions and professional bodies. With its emphasis on pre-empting harm and actively promoting welfare, safeguarding takes a more holistic approach than child protection, which focuses on protecting individual children identified as suffering or likely to suffer significant harm (see CHILD PROTECTION REGISTER). Adults in need of safeguarding may have mental-health problems, physical disability, or learning difficulties or may be elderly and frail.
