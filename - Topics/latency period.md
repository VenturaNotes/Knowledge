- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a period of development from the dissolution of the Oedipus complex at the end of the phallic stage around 5 or 6 years of age until the genital stage at puberty. It is characterized by a decrease in sexual activity, a decline in sexual investment in object relations, and the emergence of emotions such as shame and disgust. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) presented the concept in its fully developed form in 1924 in an article entitled 'The Dissolution of the Oedipus Complex' (Standard Edition, XIX, pp. 173-9). He attributed the term latency period to his friend, the German physician Wilhelm Fliess (1858-1928), and he used the term period rather than stage because no new organization of sexuality takes place at this time$\textemdash$it is not a turning point.
