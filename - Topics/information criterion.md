- A likelihood function based statistic used as a model selection criterion. Important examples are the Akaike and the Bayes-Schwarz information criteria; both contain the same goodness-of-fit term but the latter, in comparison to the former, imposes a stronger penalty for a larger number of model parameters, and, therefore, tends to favour more parsimonious models. See also GOODNESS OF FIT MEASURES.
