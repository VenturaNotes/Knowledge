- $n$. A type of conditioning (1) that occurs when an animal learns to respond to a stimulus without reinforcement (1) of the response but with associative learning of a contingency between a conditioned stimulus and the reinforcement. For example, in pigeons, brief illumination of a plastic key before the delivery of food results in the pigeon learning to peck the key whenever it is illuminated. Compare SHAPING (1).
