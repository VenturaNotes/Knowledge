- For two jointly distributed random variables $X$ and $Y$ the conditional distribution of $Y$ given $X$ is the distribution of $Y$ when $X$ takes particular values. For discrete random variables it is given by$$P[Y=y \mid X=x]=P[X=x, Y=y] / P[X=x]$$For continuous random variables, the conditional density function is given by$$f_{Y \mid X}(y \mid X=x)=f_{X, Y}(x, y) / f_{X}(x)$$where $f(x, y)$ is the joint density function, and $f(x)$ is the marginal density function of $X$.
