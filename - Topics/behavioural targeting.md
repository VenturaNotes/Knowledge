- An online marketing technique in which software is used to track a person's Internet use (websites visited, activities on social media) so that advertising can be tailored to their individual profile. In this way businesses are able to direct advertising to those consumers more likely to be interested in their products or services; a person who visits a website providing diet advice, for example, may subsequently receive advertisements for weight-loss products. Behavioural targeting can be controversial when it gathers information that could be considered private without the consumer's knowledge or consent. See also COOKIE.
