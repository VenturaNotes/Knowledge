- a rare neurological condition in which upper limb movements occur without an individual's awareness of or control over the actions. In extreme cases, a person will deliberately use their other arm to restrain the 'alien limb'. It is caused by damage to connections between the cerebral hemispheres or the frontal or occipital brain areas and can occur following stroke or in dementia.
