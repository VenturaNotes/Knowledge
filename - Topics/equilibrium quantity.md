- The quantity of a good supplied and demanded when the price is such that these quantities are equal, so that the market is in equilibrium. With an upward-sloping supply curve and a downward-sloping demand curve, if the price is above the equilibrium price, the quantity supplied is above the equilibrium quantity, which, in turn, is above the quantity demanded.
