- A stochastic process described by equation $y_{t}=y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t}$ where $\varepsilon_{t}$ is white noise. It is a prototypical example of unit root process. Frequently considered versions are the random walk with drift, $y_{t}=y_{t-1}+\delta$ $+\varepsilon_{t}$, and the random walk with drift and trend, $y_{t}=y_{t-1}+\delta+\gamma t+\varepsilon_{t}$.
