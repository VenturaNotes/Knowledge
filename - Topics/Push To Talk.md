- Push to talk (PTT) is a form of communication on half-duplex communication lines. This includes a two-way radio or a wireless cellular phone, using a button similar to one on a walkie-talkie to switch from voice reception to transmit mode. While in half-duplex mode, only one party present on the line can speak at a time. When multiple parties are on the line, PTT ensures efficiency and organization. PTT was used vastly in the 1980s by telephone operators to seamlessly connect with a consumer. Major phone services today like AT&T are offering enhanced PTT offering field management solutions. PTT's popularity has grown exponentially in the last decade since it allows the ability to communicate more efficiently. Industries that have benefitted from PPT include construction, event services, safety and security, and ambulance and medical services.
