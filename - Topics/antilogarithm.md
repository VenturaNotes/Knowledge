- The antilogarithm of x is the number whose logarithm is equal to x. If y is the number whose logarithm (to base a) is x, then $log_ay = x$. This is equivalent to $y = a^x$. So, if base $a$ is being used, antilog$_ax$ is identical with $a^x$; for common logarithms, antilog$_{10}x$ is just $10^x$, and this notation is preferable
