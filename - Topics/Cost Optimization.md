- Cost optimizationÂ is a method for reducing costs within an organization while improving business value. This technique involves:
	- Obtaining the best price for business purchases
	- Standardizing and simplifying costing technologies
	- Automating and digitizing IT and business operations for cost savings across an organization
- Take a manufacturer that purchases materials from an external supplier. The manufacturer might implement cost optimization strategies to leverage a better deal for those materials and pass on these savings to customers.
