- $n$. abnormal curvature or angulation of the penis. In Peyronie's disease, this is due to a localized fibrous plaque in the penis, which fails to engorge on erection. As a result, the penis angulates at this point making intercourse impossible. In a child, downward chordee is an associated deformity in hypospadias and the more severe forms are corrected surgically.
