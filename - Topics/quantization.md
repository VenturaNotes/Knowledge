- The process of constructing a discrete representation of a quantity that is usually regarded as continuous (see DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS). For example, the measurement of the amplitude of a signal at discrete intervals of time, when the signal occurs over continuous time, is called [[time quantization]], or sampling; the measurement of the brightness of picture elements ( pixels) in a space-continuous picture is called [[space quantization]], or pixelization.
- The term quantization without the predication of time or space usually refers to the quantization of amplitude; the same applies to digitization, which is nearly synonymous with quantization.
