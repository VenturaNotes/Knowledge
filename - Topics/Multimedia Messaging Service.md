- Multimedia messaging service (MMS) is a telecommunications standard that enables the transmission of text, images, audio, and video files between mobile devices. MMS is used to send messages too large for SMS, which only allows the transmission of text messages and links. Multimedia messaging services work for photos, videos, and other media files.
