- (startle reflex) a primitive reflex seen in newborn babies in response to the stimulus of a sudden noise or movement: the baby will fling its arms and legs wide and will appear to stiffen; the arms and legs are then drawn back into flexion. The Moro reflex should disappear spontaneously by four months. Its presence beyond this age is suggestive of an underlying neurological disorder, such as cerebral palsy. \[E. Moro (1874-1951), German paediatrician]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A form of the startle reflex displayed by infants up to about 12 months of age, elicited by making a sudden loud noise or raising the infant's head slightly and allowing it to drop back on to a pillow, consisting of flexion (bending) of the legs, drawing the arms across the chest, and usually a brief cry. It is often absent in premature babies, and it is sometimes used to test infants for deafness. Also called the embrace reflex. \[Named after the German paediatrician Ernst Moro (1874-1951) who first drew attention to it]
