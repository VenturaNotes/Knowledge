- Shadow IT refers to internet technology (IT) networks that employees create as workarounds for company IT network limitations. In any company, many cloud-based storage systems, file-sharing applications, collaboration tools, or SaaS apps won't run on company IT due to firewalls and restriction settings. As the name suggests, employees develop these projects and use them without the knowledge or approval of a company's IT team.
