- A code of best practice in the field of corporate governance, first issued with the Hampel Report of 1998. The Code, which incorporated the earlier recommendations of the Cadbury Report and the Greenbury Report, concerns such matters as the role of nonexecutive directors, directors' remuneration, and general issues of audit, accountability, and relations with shareholders. UK listed companies are required to disclose whether or not they have complied with the Code, and to explain any departures from it. Earlier versions of the Code, which is reissued approximately every two years, were often referred to as the Combined Code on Corporate Governance. See also Higgs Report; Turnbull Report.
