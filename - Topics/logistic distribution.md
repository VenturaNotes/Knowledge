- A continuous distribution described by the cumulative distribution function of the form$$F(x \mid \mu, \beta)=1 /[1+\exp (-(x-\mu) / \beta)]$$for $-\infty<x<\infty$ and $\beta>0$. The distribution has mean $\mu$ and variance $\pi^{2} \beta^{2} / 3$. This function, also known as the logistic function, is used in the logistic regression, or logit model.
