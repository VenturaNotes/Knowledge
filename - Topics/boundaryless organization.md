- An organization in which there has been a concerted attempt by managers to break down (1) the internal barriers that separate different levels in the hierarchy, different functions (e.g. manufacturing and marketing), and different departments; and (2) the external barriers between the organization and its suppliers, customers, and even its competitors. Becoming boundaryless normally involves the creation of cross-functional teams, delayering, and empowerment of employees.
