- For the inhomogeneous ODE $$\frac{d^2y}{dx^2}+p(x)\frac{dy}{dx} + q(x)y = r(x), y(0) = y'(0) = 0$$the solution y(x) can be written as $$y(x) = \int_0^x G(x,t)r(t) dt,$$for some function G(x, t) known as Green's function. If the above solution is written as $G(r)$ and the ODE as $Ly = r$, so that $LG(r) = r$, then G acts as a right inverse for differential operator L
