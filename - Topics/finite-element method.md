- A widely applicable approach to solving ordinary and particularly partial differential equations and similar problems. The approach embraces several variants, principally Galerkin's method and the Rayleighâ€”Ritz method. The basic idea, however, is the same and involves approximating the solution of the problem by a linear combination:

  

$$

u(x)=\sum_{j=1}^{p} c_{j} \phi_{j}(x)

$$

  

The functions $\phi_{1}, \phi_{2}, \ldots, \phi_{n}$ are always chosen to be simple and are called [[trial function|trial functions]]. The success of the method is due in part to choosing these functions to be low-degree splines. This in turn generally leads to a system of equations for the coefficients $c_{1}, c_{2}, \ldots, c_{n}$ that involves the treatment of sparse matrices, i.e. matrices in which a large proportion of the elements are zero; very efficient software can then be used.

  

In Galerkin's method the criterion for choosing the coefficients is that the amount by which $u(x)$ fails to satisfy the equation is in a certain sense small. The [[Rayleigh-Ritz method]] is a variational method. The finite-element method can in general be regarded as a process in which a solution in an infinite-dimensional space is replaced by an approximation that lies in a finite-dimensional subspace. The whole process is referred to as finite-element analysis.
