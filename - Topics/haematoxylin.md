## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. a colorless crystalline compound extracted from logwood (Haematoxylon campechianum) and used in various histological stains. When oxidized haematoxylin is converted to haematein, which imparts a blue colour to certain parts of cells, especially cell nuclei. Heidenhain's iron haematoxylin is used to stain sections that are to be photographed, since it gives great clarity at high magnification.
## Source[^2]
- A compound used in its oxidized form (haematein) as a blue dye in optical microscopy, particularly for staining smears and sections of animal tissue. It stains nuclei blue and is frequently used with eosin as a counterstain for cytoplasm. Haematoxylin requires a mordant, such as iron alum, which links the dye to the tissue. Different types of haematoxylin can be made up depending on the mordant used, the method of oxidation, and the pH . Examples are Delafield's haematoxylin and Ehrlich's haematoxylin.
