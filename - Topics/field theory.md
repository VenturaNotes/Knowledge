- $n$. Any theory in which phenomena are interpreted as resulting from the dynamic interplay of elements within a field, especially (in psychology) the theory introduced in 1935 by the German$\textendash$US psychologist Kurt Lewin (1890-1947). According to Lewin's field theory, psychological events occur within a type of field called a life space, within which the important relations are qualitative aspects of connection and position, such as belongingness, membership, and part-whole relationships. Behavior is interpreted as a function of the person and the life space, this relation being expressed by the equation $B=f(L S)$, and the life space is interpreted as the person and the environment, so that $B=f(P, E)$, meaning that behavior is a joint function of the person and the environment, behavior being represented as locomotion from one region of the life space to another, regions that attract or repel having valence.
