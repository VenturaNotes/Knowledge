- The UK government department responsible for the care, management, and collection of direct and indirect taxes, National Insurance contributions, and customs and excise duties within the UK. Its other responsibilities include the payment of tax credits and child benefit. It is governed by a small board known as the Commissioners of Revenue and Customs, but the day-to-day administration is carried out by civil servants. Inspectors of Taxes are responsible for assessing taxes, which are collected by Collectors of Taxes (see also SELF-ASSESSMENT). A taxpayer can appeal against an inspector's assessment. HM Revenue and Customs was formed from a merger of the Board of Inland Revenue and the Board of Customs and Excise in April 2005. A Revenue and Customs Prosecution Office, responsible for the prosecution of all revenue and customs cases, was established at the same time.
