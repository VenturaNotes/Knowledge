## Source [^1]
- (polysome) An aggregate of ribosomes in association with a single messenger RNA molecule during the translation process of protein synthesis. Simultaneous translation by multiple ribosomes enables the cell rapidly to make numerous copies of a polypeptide. In eukaryotes, polyribosomes are attached to the surface of the rough endoplasmic reticulum and the outer membrane of the nucleus; in bacteria they are found free in the cytoplasm.
