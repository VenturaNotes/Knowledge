- $n$. A phenomenon in judgement and decision making when less knowledge in a particular domain enables one to make more accurate judgements than more knowledge. The effect was first reported and named by the US psychologist Daniel G(ray) Goldstein (born 1969) and the German psychologist Gerd Gigerenzer (born 1947) in a chapter on the recognition heuristic in a book by Gigerenzer and several co-authors entitled Simple Heuristics That Make Us Smart in 1999 and in an article in the journal Psychological Review in 2002. They reported a study of German and US respondents who were asked, 'Which city has the larger population: San Diego or San Antonio?' The German respondents had comparatively little relevant knowledge, but all of them had heard of San Diego, and about half of them had heard of San Antonio. Nevertheless, all German respondents arrived at the correct answer that San Diego has the larger population by using the recognition heuristic; whereas only two-thirds of the US respondents, who had far more relevant knowledge, answered correctly.
