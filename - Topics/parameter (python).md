## Synthesis
- Variable name in method definition
	- #question Is it method definition or function definition in python?
	- #question What is a method definition. Does it matter where the method definition is placed in python? I believe it matters in other languages.
## Source [^1]
- These are the variable names listed inside the parentheses in a function or method definition
	- They act as placeholders for the values that will be passed 
```python
def greet(name):  # 'name' is a parameter
    print(f"Hello, {name}!")
```
- A parameter appears in the function definition so if you have `def add(a, b):`, the placeholder is `(a,b)`
- Parameters are what the function expects
