- 1. A program that accepts the definition of an operation that is to be accomplished, and automatically constructs a program for the purpose. The earliest example of this kind of program was the [[sort generator]], which took a specification of the file format and the sorted order required, and produced a sorting program. This was followed by [[report generator|report generators]], which constructed programs to print reports from files containing information in a specified format. The best-known program of this kind is RPG II. See also APPLICATION GENERATOR. 2. An element $g$ of a group $G$ with the property that the various powers

  

$$

g^{n} \cdot g^{1} \cdot g^{2}, \ldots

$$

  

ultimately include all the elements of $G$. Such a group is said to be a cyclic group; it is also an abelian group. Generators can also be defined for monoids in a similar way.

  

The set of generators $S$ of a group $G$ is a subset of $G$ having the property that every element of $G$ can be expressed as a combination of elements of $S$. See also GROUP GRAPH.
