- An import restriction imposed on imported goods, to reduce the quantity of certain goods allowed into a country from a particular exporting country, in a stated period. The purpose may be to conserve foreign currency, if there is an unfavorable balance of payments, or to protect the home market against foreign competition (see PROTECTIVE DUTY). Quotas are usually enforced by means of import licences.

- A quantitative limit to imports of some type of good. This may be set in terms of value or in physical units. A tariff-quota system is a combination of import quotas and tariffs whereby lower tariff rates apply to a specified quantity, or a quota, and higher rates apply to quantities that exceed this quota.
