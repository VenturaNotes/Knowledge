- (sexual cycle) The cycle of reproductive activity shown by most sexually mature nonpregnant female mammals except most primates (compare menstrual CYCLE). There are four phases:
	- (1) pro-oestrus (follicular phase)—Graafian follicles develop in the ovary and secrete oestrogens;
	- (2) oestrus (heat)—ovulation normally occurs, the female is ready to mate and becomes sexually attractive to the male;
	- (3) metoestrus (luteal phase)—corpus luteum develops from ruptured follicle;
	- (4) dioestrus$\textemdash$progesterone secreted by corpus luteum prepares uterus for implantation.
- The length of the cycle depends on the species: larger mammals typically have a single annual cycle with a well-defined breeding season (they are described as monoestrous). The males have a similar cycle of sexual activity. Other species may have many cycles per year (i.e. they are polyoestrous) and the male may be sexually active all the time.

- $n$. The feedback-controlled cycle of changes in the reproductive organs of many female mammals, consisting of a follicular phase and a luteal phase. It includes the menstrual cycle in women (and many female anthropoid apes), in whom there is also a menstrual phase. The anterior pituitary initially releases follicle-stimulating hormone; this causes the ovary to produce oestrogen; the oestrogen acts on the hypothalamus to inhibit further release of follicle-stimulating hormone and to stimulate the release of luteinizing hormone instead by the anterior pituitary; this hormone triggers ovulation and causes the ovary to produce progesterone; when this hormone reaches the hypothalamus it inhibits further release of luteinizing hormone, thereby completing the cycle. US estrous cycle. See also menstrual cycle, pheromone. \[From Latin oestrus a gadfly or frenzy, from Greek oistros a gadfly + kyklos a circle or cycle]
