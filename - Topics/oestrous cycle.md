- (sexual cycle) The cycle of reproductive activity shown by most sexually mature nonpregnant female mammals except most primates (compare menstrual CYCLE). There are four phases:
	- (1) pro-oestrus (follicular phase)—Graafian follicles develop in the ovary and secrete oestrogens;
	- (2) oestrus (heat)—ovulation normally occurs, the female is ready to mate and becomes sexually attractive to the male;
	- (3) metoestrus (luteal phase)—corpus luteum develops from ruptured follicle;
	- (4) dioestrus$\textemdash$progesterone secreted by corpus luteum prepares uterus for implantation.
- The length of the cycle depends on the species: larger mammals typically have a single annual cycle with a well-defined breeding season (they are described as monoestrous). The males have a similar cycle of sexual activity. Other species may have many cycles per year (i.e. they are polyoestrous) and the male may be sexually active all the time.
