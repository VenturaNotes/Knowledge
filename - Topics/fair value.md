- (fair market value) The amount of money for which it is assumed an asset or liability could be exchanged in an arm's length transaction between informed and willing parties. The concept is essential in acquisition accounting. It is also important, if controversial, in accounting for derivatives and other complex financial instruments. The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland permits fair value accounting in a much wider range of circumstances than was the case in previous UK accounting practice.
