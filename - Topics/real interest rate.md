- The actual interest rate less the current rate of inflation. For example, if a bank is paying $3 \%$ interest and the rate of inflation is $2 \%$, the real growth of a deposit held for a year in the bank is $1 \%$-this is the real rate of interest. Real interest rates are used to calculate more accurate pretax returns on investment, i.e. by discounting inflation.
