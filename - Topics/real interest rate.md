- The actual interest rate less the current rate of inflation. For example, if a bank is paying $3 \%$ interest and the rate of inflation is $2 \%$, the real growth of a deposit held for a year in the bank is $1 \%$-this is the real rate of interest. Real interest rates are used to calculate more accurate pretax returns on investment, i.e. by discounting inflation.

- The real rate of interest received on the loan of financial capital. This is the money return, adjusted for inflation. If the nominal interest rate is $i$ and the rate of inflation is $\rho$, the real rate of interest of $r$ is defined by$$(1+r)=(1+i) /(1+\rho)$$For low interest and inflation rates, the approximation $r \cong i-\rho$ is fairly accurate and is frequently used.
