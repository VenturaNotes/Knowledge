- An array of elements, with many bits per element, that map one to one to the colour or greyscale image on a raster display. The elements may not specify the colour or greyscale directly but may instead be indices into a lookup table that specifies the colour or greyscale. Typically, 24 bits are used for each element to specify three 8-bit indices into colour tables that define the RGB components of the colour for that pixel.
