- An array of elements, with many bits per element, that map one to one to the color or greyscale image on a raster display. The elements may not specify the color or greyscale directly but may instead be indices into a lookup table that specifies the color or greyscale. Typically, 24 bits are used for each element to specify three 8-bit indices into color tables that define the RGB components of the color for that pixel.
