- (seminal receptacle) (pl. spermathecae) A sac or receptacle in some female animals (e.g. many insects) or hermaphrodite animals (e.g. earthworms) in which sperm from the mate is stored until the eggs are ready to be fertilized, e.g. when environmental conditions are appropriate. Sperm are released from the spermatheca to fertilize eggs as they travel through the reproductive tract before being passed out of the body.
