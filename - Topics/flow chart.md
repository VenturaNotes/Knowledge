- A chart used to provide a model for the flow of material, information, or people through a system. The primary purpose of a flow chart is to identify the activities taking place within a system and to enable this information to be presented graphically. Flow charts can be used in the initial design layout of a process, to diagnose problems, or to optimize existing processes by, for example, identifying duplication of effort or elements in which no value is added. The principles of flow charting now form the basis for a range of computer packages enabling production and service environments to be simulated with 'what-if' scenarios. There are a number of conventional symbols used in flow charts. The important ones are the process box, which indicates a process taking place, and the decision lozenge, which indicates where a decision is needed.

- $n$. A diagram consisting of a series of boxes, each representing a particular process or operation, joined by arrows indicating the output of one process or operation to another. There is usually one particular box from which the sequence begins, and some boxes, often distinguished by a distinctive shape, may represent decision or choice points from which two or more arrows emerge, each indicating a different decision or choice. Also called a block diagram.
