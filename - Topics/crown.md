- $n$. 
- (1) the part of a tooth normally visible in the mouth and usually covered by enamel.
- (2) a dental restoration that covers most or all of the natural crown of a tooth. It may be made of porcelain (sometimes bonded to a metal substructure), gold, a combination of these, or less commonly other materials. Most crowns are like thimbles and are custom made to fit over a trimmed-down tooth. Preformed metal crowns may be used on primary teeth. A post crown is used to restore a tooth when insufficient of the natural crown remains. A post is inserted into the root and the missing center of the tooth is built up as a core; over it is fitted a thimble-like crown to restore the natural shape of the tooth. Root canal treatment is required before a post crown can be made.
