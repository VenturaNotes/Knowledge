- a congenital abnormality of the heart in which the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle. Life is impossible unless there is an additional abnormality, such as a septal defect, that permits the mixing of blood between the pulmonary and systemic (aortic) circulations. Few of those untreated survive infancy and childhood, but the defect may be improved or corrected surgically. In congenitally corrected transposition, it is in fact the ventricles that are transposed rather than the great vessels. Thus the aorta arises from the right ventricle and the pulmonary artery from the left ventricle, as in uncorrected transposition, but in this case the blood flow in the systemic and pulmonary circulations follows the normal routes.
