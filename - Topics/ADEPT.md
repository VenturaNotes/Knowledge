- n. antibody-directed enzyme prodrug therapy: a method under development for the treatment of cancer. It involves the patient being injected first with an antibody-enzyme complex that binds specifically to tumour cells, and later with a prodrug that is inactive until it comes into contact with the antibody-enzyme complex. The enzyme converts the prodrug into a cytotoxic form, which is concentrated around the tumour and can therefore destroy the cancer cells without damaging normal tissue.
