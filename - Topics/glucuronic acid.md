## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- a sugar acid derived from glucose. Glucuronic acid is an important constituent of chondroitin sulphate (found in cartilage) and hyaluronic acid (found in synovial fluid).
## Source[^2]
- A compound, $\mathrm{OC}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{9} \mathrm{O}_{6}$, derived from the oxidation of glucose. It is an important constituent of gums and mucilages. Glucuronic acid can combine with hydroxyl $(-\mathrm{OH})$, carboxyl $(-\mathrm{COOH})$, or amino $\left(-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)$ groups to form a glucuronide. The addition of a glucuronide group to a molecule (glucuronidation) generally increases the solubility of a compound; hence glucuronidation plays an important role in the excretion of foreign substances (see PHASE II METABOLISM).
