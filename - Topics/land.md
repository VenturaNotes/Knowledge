- In law, the part of the earth's surface that can be owned, including all buildings, trees, minerals, etc., attached to or forming part of it. It also includes the airspace above the land necessary for its reasonable enjoyment. In law, a first-floor flat can constitute a separate piece of land, although it has no contact with the soil, just as a cellar may be a separate estate in land.
