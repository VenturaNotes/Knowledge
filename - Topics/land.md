- In law, the part of the earth's surface that can be owned, including all buildings, trees, minerals, etc., attached to or forming part of it. It also includes the airspace above the land necessary for its reasonable enjoyment. In law, a first-floor flat can constitute a separate piece of land, although it has no contact with the soil, just as a cellar may be a separate estate in land.
## Source[^2]
- A natural resource employed as a factor of production. Land is used in economic activity in a variety of ways: for growing crops and keeping animals; for extracting minerals; and to provide sites for buildings and for transport and leisure facilities. Land as provided by nature can be changed by human activities: agricultural land can be improved by fertilizers and drainage, or ruined by erosion. See also MARGINAL LAND.
