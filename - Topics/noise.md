- Any signal that occurs in an electronic or communication system and is considered extraneous to the desired signal being propagated. Noise can be introduced, for example, by external disturbances and may be deleterious in a given system since it can produce spurious signals, i.e. errors.
- The [[noise immunity]] is a measure of the magnitude of external disturbances that a digital circuit can tolerate without producing errors. Logic values are represented electronically by two different voltage levels. Any noise introduced into logic circuitry by external disturbances is added (or subtracted) from the real digital logic signal. The [[noise margin]] is the maximum noise voltage that can be added or subtracted from the logic signal before a threshold voltage for a logic state is passed. See also GAUSSIAN NOISE, IMPULSE NOISE, WHITE NOISE.
