## Synthesis

- Any signal that occurs in an electronic or communication system and is considered extraneous to the desired signal being propagated. Noise can be introduced, for example, by external disturbances and may be deleterious in a given system since it can produce spurious signals, i.e. errors.
- The [[noise immunity]] is a measure of the magnitude of external disturbances that a digital circuit can tolerate without producing errors. Logic values are represented electronically by two different voltage levels. Any noise introduced into logic circuitry by external disturbances is added (or subtracted) from the real digital logic signal. The [[noise margin]] is the maximum noise voltage that can be added or subtracted from the logic signal before a threshold voltage for a logic state is passed. See also GAUSSIAN NOISE, IMPULSE NOISE, WHITE NOISE.

- (1) In communication theory, any interference or distraction that disrupts the communication process. 
- (2) In statistics, random fluctuations in data.
## Source[^3]
- (1) The opposite of the information content of a signal. In an econometric model, noise refers to the random component of the data-generating process.
- (2) Environmental noise is the noise from transport and industrial activities. In the European Union the assessment and monitoring of environmental noise is regulated by a set of directives that serve as a basis for the development of local measures.

- $n$. 
- (1) Any unwanted or disturbing sound, or any sound without any definite frequency or pitch. See also noise (2). Compare tone (1). 
- (2) Random disturbances in any communication channel in addition to the signal that is being transmitted, or more generally any random component in a time series that degrades its periodicity. See COLORED NOISE, FROZEN NOISE, PINK NOISE, WHITE NOISE. See also DECIBEL, SIGNAL DETECTION THEORY, SIGNAL-TO-NOISE RATIO. \[From Latin nausea the sensation of being about to vomit]
