- Serverless printing, also called managed direct IP printing, is direct printing over an internet protocol. Traditionally, print servers manage all printing processes within a business or department. Print jobs are sent from workstations to the server and then to the printer. Serverless printing cuts out the server, allowing users to print directly from their workstations. This involves installing and managing print drivers on every single workstation. It also means every printer issue requires an IT specialist to visit individual workstations one by one, rather than managing a single server.
