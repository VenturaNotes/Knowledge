- Businesses receive feedback from many sources, including customer surveys, social media, and phone calls. A multichannel feedback management tool helps collate and analyze this feedback data, which may include customers' point-of-sale experiences, after-sale experiences, or product feedback. The use of multichannel feedback management ranges from SMS surveys that only require a single-digit input from the customer to phone call surveys and surveys at the end of order confirmation emails.
