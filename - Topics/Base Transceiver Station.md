- A base transceiver station (BTS)—also called a base station—is a type of transmitter called a fixed radio transmitter. It sends and receives wireless signals to mobile devices. Then it converts these signals to digital signals and sends them to a mobile network. Finally, the network routes the digital signals to the internet or other terminals in the network. This process happens in just a few seconds. A BTS, therefore, is an essential part of a cellular network. It is the primary communication point for the mobile devices that businesses use to make calls to communicate with customers, clients, suppliers, investors, partners, etc.
