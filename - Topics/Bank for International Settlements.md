- An international bank based in Basel, founded in 1930 to coordinate payments of reparations after the First World War. Its possible role as the principal international bank was taken over after 1945 by the International Monetary Fund. The BIS has acted as trustee for the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development and the European Monetary Agreement, and as a clearinghouse for European Currency Units. It sets capital adequacy ratios for European banks, and compiles statistics on international debt. Most European central banks are members of the BIS, as are those of Canada, Japan, and the United States.

## Source[^2]
- (BIS) An international bank that fosters cooperation among central banks and other agencies in pursuit of monetary and financial stability. The BIS was originally established in 1930 as a financial institution to coordinate the payment of war reparations between European central banks. It was hoped that the BIS, with headquarters in Basle, would develop into a European central bank but many of its functions were taken over by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) after World War II. Since then the BIS has fulfilled several roles including acting as a trustee and agent for such international groups as the OECD, the European Monetary System, and the IMF. The frequent meetings of the BIS directors have been a useful means of cooperation between central banks, especially in combating short-term speculative monetary movements. The BIS also sets capital adequacy ratios for banks. The original members were France, Belgium, West Germany, Italy, and the UK. There are now 55 members worldwide, including most European central banks (notably the ECB), as well as the monetary authorities of the USA, Japan, Russia, and China. The London agent is the Bank of England, whose governor is a member of the board of directors of the BIS.
