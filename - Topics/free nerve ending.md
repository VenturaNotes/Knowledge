- $n$. A sensory receptor consisting of finely myelinated or unmyelinated ends of the axons of nerve fibres, located throughout the body but concentrated mainly in the dermis or epidermis of the skin, in certain mucous membranes, in the corneas of the eyes, adjacent to the roots of hairs, and around the bodies of sweat glands. Some free nerve endings are pain receptors (nocireceptors); others function as temperature receptors supplying warm spots and cold spots on the skin.
