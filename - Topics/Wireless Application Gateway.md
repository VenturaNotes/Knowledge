- A wireless application gateway (WAG) is a server-based gateway, i.e., a networking software or hardware in telecommunication networks that enables data to flow from one network to another. WAG provides wireless access to enterprise applications. Here's how it works: WAGs plug into the infrastructure of the enterprise application, separate data, ensure network availability, and reduce the risk of data failure. In other words, WAGs preventÂ network redundancy. WAGs can provide secure access to any data source and generate data in a PDA, pager, desktop, wireless telephone, among other devices. The WAG server is either installed within an organization or hosted by a third party.
