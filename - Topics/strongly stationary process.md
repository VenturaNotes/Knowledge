- A stochastic process $x_{t}$ is said to be strongly stationary if the joint distribution of $X_{t_{1}}, X_{t_{2}}, \ldots, X_{t_{n}}$ is the same as the joint distribution of $X_{t_{1}+k}, X_{t_{2}+k}, \ldots, X_{t_{n}+k}$, i.e. is invariant under translation. Strong stationarity implies weak, or covariance, stationarity; the converse in general does not hold.
