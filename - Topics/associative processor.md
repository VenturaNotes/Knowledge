- (content-addressable parallel processor) A processor having parallel processing capabilities by virtue of the parallel memory manipulation properties of associative memory. The ability to interrogate and write to selected bits in each word of associative memory in parallel makes possible word-parallel bit-serial operations, which are efficient for the manipulation of large data sets.
