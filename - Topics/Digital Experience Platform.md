- A digital experience platform (DXP) is a set of technologies for businesses that are focused on improving their customers’ experiences. DXPs are open platforms that integrate with an organization's existing software and expand across all departments. They are often compared to customer service management systems (CSMs), but digital experience platforms consist of a wider range of functionality. The platform is used for improving user experiences when visiting websites or mobile apps. It can also aid in identifying factors that lead to decreased customer experiences, like slow response times, so that they can be remedied.
