- Retaliation to foreign trade restrictions which is imposed mainly to deter further restrictions. If country $A$ raises its tariffs or cuts its quotas on $B$ 's goods, $B$ has to decide whether to retaliate. If $B$ could assume that $A$ would take no further action, the best reaction might be to do nothing, on the argument that while $A$ 's action was harmful, retaliation would just make matters worse. However, $B$ may believe that this would be interpreted by $A$ as a signal that further restrictions would not be resisted, so $B$ may take some form of retaliatory action simply to signal to $A$ that they should go no further.
