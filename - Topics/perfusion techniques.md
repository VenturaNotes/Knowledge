- Methods of maintaining a live organ in isolation by circulating fluid containing essential nutrients and oxygen through and around the organ. Maintaining the circulation through an organ allows the delivery of nutrients to the tissues and the removal from them of toxins and waste products. Perfusion techniques are particularly useful in studying the metabolism of drugs in isolation in an intact organ, such as the liver or kidney.
