## Synthesis
- Marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is preferred over economic rate of substitution (ERS)
- MRS shows the opportunity cost of acquiring an additional unit on the x-axis
	- If MRS = 3, every additional unit on the x-axis is as good as 3 more units on the y-axis
## Source [^1]
- The slope of the budget constraint shows the opportunity cost of acquiring an additional item on the x-axis. The slope is also called the economic rate of substitution (ERS)
- "Marginal rate of substitution" and "economic rate of substitution" are essentially the same concept with "marginal rate of substitution" being the more commonly used term in economics.
	- It refers to the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade one good for another while maintaining the same level of utility. 

## Source[^2]
- Marginal rate of substitution (MRS) is the amount of one good that a consumer is willing to give up in exchange for a new good, while maintaining the same level of [[utility]].
- MRS is used in [[indifference theory]] to analyze consumer behavior

## Source[^3]
- Given that Good X is measured on the x-axis and Good Y is measured on the y-axis
	- (1) A marginal rate of substitution of 3 means that, from the consumer's point of view, 1 more unit of Good X is as good as 3 more units of Good Y.
		- #comment The MRS seems to be calculated by $\frac {Y}{X}$ 
	- (2) An MRS of 1.5 means that, from the consumer's point of view, 15 more unit of Good Y is as good as 10 more units of Good X
	- (3) As you move to the right of any [[indifference map]], consumer [[utility]] always increases
