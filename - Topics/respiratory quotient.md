- (RQ) the ratio of the volume of carbon dioxide transferred from the blood into the alveoli to the volume of oxygen absorbed into the alveoli. The RQ is usually about 0.8 because more oxygen is taken up than carbon dioxide excreted.
## Source[^2]
- (RQ) The ratio of the volume of carbon dioxide produced by an organism during respiration to the volume of oxygen consumed. It varies according to the nature of the food being metabolized. For aerobic respiration under 'normal' metabolic conditions, the RQ is usually about 1.0 for carbohydrates, about 0.7 for fats and other lipids, and roughly 0.8 for proteins.
