- A measure used in evaluating the job performance of employees. It involves disaggregating a particular job into its key tasks, identifying a range of possible behaviours that can be displayed by an employee undertaking each task, placing these behaviours on a scale ranging from ineffective to excellent performance, and assessing the jobholder against these scales for each of the tasks. This allows a total profile of job performance to be created for each employee, covering the various dimensions of his or her work. Involving jobholders themselves in the creation of performance scales can afford the BARS method greater validity. Compare BEHAVIOURAL OBSERVATION SCALE; MIXEDSTANDARD SCALE. See also CRITICAL INCIDENT TECHNIQUE.
