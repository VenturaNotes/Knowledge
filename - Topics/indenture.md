- (1) A deed, especially one creating or transferring an estate in land. It derives its name from the former practice of writing the two parts of a two-part deed on one piece of parchment and separating the two parts by an irregular wavy line. The two parts of the indenture were known to belong together if the indented edges fitted together. A deed with a straight edge was known as a deed poll. 
- (2) A document establishing the terms and conditions of a securities issue. 
- (3) See APPRENTICE.
