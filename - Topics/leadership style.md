- The traits, behavioral tendencies, and characteristic methods of a person in a leadership position. An important dimension of leadership style is the extent to which the leader is willing to delegate responsibility and encourage input from followers; some key styles here are those of the authoritarian leader, democratic leader, and laissez-faire leader. Another basic dimension is the extent to which a leader is task-motivated (concerned with defining goals and the means to achieve them) or relationship-motivated (concerned with supporting and encouraging subordinates). A distinction can also be drawn between the charismatic leader, who relies on his or her personal qualities to inspire followers, and the bureaucratic leader, who depends on his or her position in the hierarchy and an established set of rules and procedures. See TRANSACTIONAL LEADERSHIP; TRANSFORMATIONAL LEADERSHIP. See also POWER STYLES.
