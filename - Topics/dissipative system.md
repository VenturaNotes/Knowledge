- A system that involves irreversible processes. All real systems are dissipative (in contrast to such idealized systems as the frictionless pendulum, which is invariant under time reversal). In a dissipative system the system is moving towards a state of equilibrium, which can be regarded as moving toward a point attractor in phase space; this is equivalent to moving towards the minimum of the free energy, F.
