- $n$. A form of self-presentation calculated to increase one's attractiveness in the eyes of another person. It was first investigated experimentally in the early 1960s by the US psychologist Edward Ellsworth Jones (1926-93), who observed three major classes of tactics commonly used by ingratiators who are motivated to win the favour of a target person: other-enhancement, in which the ingratiator flatters and compliments the target person; opinion conformity, in which the ingratiator pretends to share the target person's attitudes on important issues; and biased self-presentation, in which ingratiators of both sexes emphasize their most attractive qualities and play down their weak points. In addition, if circumstances allow, an ingratiator often renders favours to the target person. Research has revealed that such ingratiation tactics are often successful in eliciting liking, and that when they succeed, ingratiators often come to believe, presumably out of vanity, that they did not use any tactics. ingratiate $v b$. \[From Latin in into + gratia favour]
