- A technique related to gene knockout in which a gene is inserted into the genome of a cell, cell line, or organism. Using the technique of Cre/loxP recombination, such an insertion can be targeted to a particular site in the genome and may replace or supplement existing genes. Moreover, it can be induced to switch on only in certain tissues, or at certain stages of development, thus mimicking the normal behavior of genes.
