- Application control is a security measure that can help businesses protect their data and systems from being accessed or modified by unauthorized users or applications. This is done by establishing rules limiting which programs can be installed on a computer or network and what actions those applications can perform. For example, an application control policy might prohibit all users from installing new software without getting approval from their IT department.
