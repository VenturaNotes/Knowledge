## Synthesis
### Sum of first n Natural Numbers
- $S_n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$
## Source [^1]
### Definition
- Denoted $\mathbb{N}$
## Source[^2]
- Closed under multiplication
- Multiplication over the naturals is a binary operation
## Source[^3]
- The natural numbers are the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, and so on, possibly excluding 0.
	- Some might refer the natural numbers as the [[nonnegative integers|non-negative integers]]
		- 0, 1, 2, 3, ...
	- Some might refer the natural numbers as the [[positive integers]]
		- 1, 2, 3, ...

## Source[^4]
- In [[type theory]], 0 is a term of type $\mathbb{N}$ 

## Source[^5]
- Natural Numbers:
	- $\mathbb{N}$ := {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...}
	- Explicitly including zero: $\mathbb{N}_0 := \{0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$

## Source[^6]
- The sequence 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, .... are the counting numbers
	- This sequence can be represented as $(s_n)_{n \ge 1}$ which has a [[closed formula]] $a_n = n$ 
		- #comment An example would be if n = 6, then $a_6 = 6$ which means that the 6th element of the sequence would equal 6.
			- The first element would be $a_1 = 1$ 
			- Seems like this is the counting numbers where 0 is not part of the set

## Source[^7]
- (natural) A number that can count the members of a set. In effect, the natural numbers are the non negative integers, i.e. the set $\{0,1,2, \ldots\}$.
