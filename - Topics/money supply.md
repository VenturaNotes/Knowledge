- The total amount of money available in an economy

- The quantity of money issued by a country's monetary authorities (usually the central bank). If the demand for money is stable, the widely accepted quantity theory of money implies that increases in the money supply will lead directly to an increase in the price level, i.e. to inflation. Since the 1970s most Western governments have attempted to reduce inflation by controlling the money supply. This raises two issues:
	- (i) how to measure the money supply;
	- (ii) how to control the money supply (see MONETARY POLICY).
- In the UK various measures of the money supply have been used, from the very narrow M0 to the very broad M5. They are usually defined as:
	- M0$\textemdash$notes and coins in circulation plus the banks' till money and the banks' balances with the Bank of England;
	- M1$\textemdash$notes and coins in circulation plus private-sector current accounts and deposit accounts that can be transferred by cheque;
	- M2$\textemdash$notes and coins in circulation plus non-interest-bearing bank deposits plus building society deposits plus National Savings accounts;
	- M3$\textemdash$M1 plus all other private-sector bank deposits plus certificates of deposit;
	- M3c$\textemdash$M3 plus foreign currency bank deposits;
	- M4$\textemdash$M1 plus most private-sector bank deposits plus holdings of money-market instruments (e.g. Treasury bills);
	- M5$\textemdash$M4 plus building society deposits.
- In some contexts the amount of money existing in an economy is called the monetary stock. To obtain the money supply the monetary stock has to be multiplied by the velocity of circulation. See also MONETARY POLICY.
## Source[^4]
- The amount of money in an economy. This may be the country's own money, supplied by its banking system, or foreign money, used in preference to domestic money. There is no single accepted definition of what constitutes money: while notes and coin are legal tender and must be included in any definition, and bank deposits repayable on demand are unlikely to be excluded, there are various types of deposit in non-bank financial intermediaries such as building societies, and various forms of highly liquid security, which can be included or excluded in various ways. For various definitions applied in the UK see M0 to M5.
