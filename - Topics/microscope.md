- $n$. an instrument for producing a greatly magnified image of an object, which may be so small as to be invisible to the naked eye. Light or optical microscopes use light as a radiation source for viewing the specimen and combinations of lenses to magnify the image; these are usually an objective and an eyepiece. See also ELECTRON MICROSCOPE; OPERATING MICROSCOPE; ULTRAMICROSCOPE. $\textemdash$ microscopical adj. â€”microscopy $n$.
## Source[^2]
- Any device for forming a magnified image of a small object. The simple microscope consists of a biconvex magnifying glass or an equivalent system of lenses, either hand-held or in a simple frame. The compound microscope uses two lenses or systems of lenses, the second magnifying the real image formed by the first (see illustration). The lenses are usually mounted at the opposite ends of a tube that has mechanical controls to move it in relation to the object. An optical condenser and mirror, often with a separate light source, provide illumination of the object. The widely used binocular microscope consists of two separate instruments fastened together so that one eye looks through one while the other eye looks through the other. This gives stereoscopic vision. See Chronology.
