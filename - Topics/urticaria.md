- (nettle rash, hives) $n$. an itchy rash resulting partly from the release of histamine by mast cells. This causes either short-lived itchy weals, deeper swellings (angio-oedema), or both. Individual weals typically appear rapidly and resolve spontaneously within hours. Acute urticaria is common and represents an immediate response to such allergens as seafood or nuts; it has been linked with upper respiratory tract infections, although many cases remain unexplained. Chronic urticaria is not an allergic condition and may persist for years. Angio-oedema occurs when the weals involve the deeper levels of the skin, resulting in swelling of the lips, eyes, or tongue, which may constitute a medical emergency. Urticaria can be treated by taking antihistamines regularly, but sometimes immunosuppressant treatment is needed, especially in autoimmune subtypes. Cholinergic urticaria is a condition in which very small weals are brought on by heat, exercise, or emotion; treatment is with antihistamines, but other drugs, including danazol, may be used for severe cases.
