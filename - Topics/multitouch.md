- Describing a user-interface in which surfaces are capable of simultaneously sensing the location of more than one finger in contact. This allows interactions based on gestures with multiple fingers, such as pushing finger and thumb together to indicate 'zoom-in' and moving them apart to request a 'zoom-out'. First used commercially on a major scale in 2007, multitouch interfaces are now associated particularly with Apple devices such as the iPhone and iPad.
