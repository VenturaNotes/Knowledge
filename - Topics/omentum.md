- (epiploon) $n$. a double layer of peritoneum attached to the stomach and linking it with other abdominal organs, such as the liver, spleen, and intestine. The greater omentum is a highly folded portion of the omentum, rich in fatty tissue, that covers the intestines in an apron-like fashion. It acts as a heat insulator and prevents friction between abdominal organs. The lesser omentum links the stomach with the liver. $\textemdash$omental adj.
