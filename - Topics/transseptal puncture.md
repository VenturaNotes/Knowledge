- a procedure in which, under X-ray guidance, a sharptipped catheter positioned in the heart is used to create a small hole in the partition (septum) separating the atria. This allows other catheters to be passed from the right to the left atrium for the purposes of pressure measurement, ablation, or valvuloplasty.
