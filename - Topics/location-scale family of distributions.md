- For any distribution function $f(x)$, a family of distribution functions, indexed by the parameters $\mu$ (the location parameter) and $\sigma$ (the scale parameter), of the form $(1 / \sigma) f((x-\mu) /$ $\sigma$ ). An example is the normal family: a normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and variance $\sigma^{2}$ can be obtained from the standard normal distribution by stretching $(\sigma>1)$ or contracting $(\sigma<1)$ the graph of standard normal probability density function with the scale parameter and then shifting the graph by the location parameter, so that the point that was above 0 is now above $\mu$.
