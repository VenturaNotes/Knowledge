## Source[^2]
- A measure of the extent of a surface, or the part of surface enclosed by some specified boundary. For simple geometrical shapes such as rectangles, triangles, cylinders, etc., the areas can be calculated by simple formulae based on their dimensions (see Appendix 1). Other more complex plane figures or 3-dimensional surfaces require the use of integration, or numerical approximations to find their areas. (See Surface Area)
