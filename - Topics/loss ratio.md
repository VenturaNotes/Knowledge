- The total of the claims paid out by an insurance company, underwriting syndicate, etc., expressed as a percentage of the amount of premiums coming in in the same period. For example, if claims total $£ 2 \mathrm{M}$ and premiums total $£ 4 \mathrm{M}$, the result is a $50 \%$ loss ratio. Insurers use this figure as a guide to the profitability of their business when they are reconsidering premium rates for a particular risk.
