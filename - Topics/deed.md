- A written document that states clearly that it is intended to be a deed and that has been validly executed as a deed. These factors make a deed different from an ordinary written agreement. Until 1990 all deeds required a seal in order to be validly executed but it is now only necessary for a deed to be signed, witnessed, and delivered. Delivery may be actual or constructive, i.e. by carrying out some act to show that the deed is intended to be operative. Some transactions, such as conveyances of land, must be carried out by deed to be effective.
