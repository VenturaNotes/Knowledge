- Expansion of a company through the purchase of another business. If this is unincorporated, terms are agreed with the owners. If the other business is a public company, its shares are bought. Where some, but not all, of the shares of another company are bought, special rules govern the treatment of existing shareholders who do not wish to sell their holdings. See also REVERSE TAKEOVER.
