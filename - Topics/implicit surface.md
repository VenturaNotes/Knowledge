- A surface defined by those points that satisfy$$f(x, y, z)=c$$for some constant $c$. If $f$ happens to be an algebraic function then this is an algebraic surface. If a surface is defined implicitly, there is an easy test of whether a point $(x, y, z)$ lies on the surface or is inside or outside the surface.
