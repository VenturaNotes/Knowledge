- Ethernet services are network services that use Ethernet as a transport. They are designed to connect your business with high-performance internet access. It also gives point-to-point connectivity and other value-added features such as VPNs. This is for secure communications between sites or remote users. With Ethernet, it is possible to combine voice, video, and data into one integrated service package. This is even possible in areas where traditional copper wire services cannot reach. This may be due to distance limitations or technology restrictions. These include bridges or tunnels.
