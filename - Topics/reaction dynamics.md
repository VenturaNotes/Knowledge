- The microscopic dynamics of chemical reactions, i.e. the evolution of changes in chemical reactions at the atomic length and timescales. This requires an understanding of how molecular structures evolve in time, as specified by time-dependent quantum mechanics and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Reaction dynamics can be investigated using spectroscopy combined with lasers, scattering experiments that take into account the internal structure of molecules, and the concept of energy landscapes.
