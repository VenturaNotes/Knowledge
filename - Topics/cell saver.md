- a machine that aspirates blood lost during surgery and immediately spins, washes, and filters it for retransfusion back into the patient's body (see AUTOTRANSFUSION). The process, called intraoperative cell salvage, is used in surgery that has significant blood loss, such as orthopaedic and vascular surgery and Caesarean section, and avoids the costs and risks of allogeneic transfusion.
