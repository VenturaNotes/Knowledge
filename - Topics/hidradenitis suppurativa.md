- an unpleasant condition characterized by deep abscesses in the armpits, groin, and anogenital regions leading to sinuses and bridge scarring. It is regarded as part of the follicular occlusion tetrad. It is three times more common in women and may be under androgen control. Treatment is by weight loss, smoking cessation, long-term antibiotics, anti-androgens, or occasionally surgery. The condition is difficult to treat but often resolves spontaneously after many years.
