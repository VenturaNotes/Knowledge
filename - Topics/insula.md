- $n$. an area of the cerebral cortex that is overlapped by the sides of the deep lateral sulcus (cleft) in each hemisphere.

- (insular cortex) (pl. insulae) A region of the forebrain lying deep within the cortex of each cerebral hemisphere. The insulae are thought to process information about the state of the body$\textemdash$'how it feels'$\textemdash$and integrate this with parts of the limbic system involved with feeling emotion. They are associated with basic emotions such as pain, joy, sadness, and fear, and with bodily desires, such as cravings for food or drugs. The insulae of humans and great apes have an expanded anterior region and also contain a unique type of spindle-shaped neuron called a VEN (von Economo neuron) after their discoverer, the Austrian neurologist Constantin von Economo (1876-1931). The VENs are thought to account for the higher cognitive functions of the insulae in humans, such as planning and decision-making.

- $n$. The large pyramid-shaped structure in the limbic system of the brain that lies deep between the opercula or lips of the lateral sulcus of each cerebral hemisphere and that is exposed by retracting the temporal lobe. The anterior part functions as the cortical pain center and also contains mirror neurons for emotion, and the posterior part is implicated in language functions. Also called the island of Reil. See also pain asymboLia. \[From Latin insula an island]
