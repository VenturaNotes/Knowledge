- (insular cortex) (pl. insulae) A region of the forebrain lying deep within the cortex of each cerebral hemisphere. The insulae are thought to process information about the state of the body$\textemdash$'how it feels'$\textemdash$and integrate this with parts of the limbic system involved with feeling emotion. They are associated with basic emotions such as pain, joy, sadness, and fear, and with bodily desires, such as cravings for food or drugs. The insulae of humans and great apes have an expanded anterior region and also contain a unique type of spindle-shaped neuron called a VEN (von Economo neuron) after their discoverer, the Austrian neurologist Constantin von Economo (1876-1931). The VENs are thought to account for the higher cognitive functions of the insulae in humans, such as planning and decision-making.
