## Source [^1]
- A theory of leadership suggesting that a leader needs to influence followers' perceptions of work goals, self-development goals, and paths to goal attainment. A leader will be successful to the extent that he or she creates an expectancy that effort will lead to accomplishment and that accomplishment will produce valued rewards. The leadership style best suited to achieve this will depend on the characteristics of followers and the nature of the work setting. The model is a development of the valence-instrumentality-expectancy theory of motivation.
