- The command prompt is a text-based interface for users to type in commands for a computer system to execute. It lets users use a keyboard, instead of a mouse, to navigate a computer’s operating system. The command prompt is commonly used to automate repetitive computer tasks, as it’s faster and more efficient than other types of computer interfaces. Modern Windows and Linux operating systems still offer the command prompt to help facilitate administrative computing tasks.
