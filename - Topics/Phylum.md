- (pl. phyla) A category used in the classification of organisms that consists of one or several similar or closely related classes. Examples of phyla are the Ascomycota, Bryophyta, and Chordata. In traditional classification schemes phyla are grouped into kingdoms, and for plants the division is sometimes used instead of the phylum.
