- $n$. the final stage of mitosis and of each of the divisions of meiosis, in which the chromosomes at each end of the cell become long and thin and the nuclear membrane reforms around them. The cytoplasm begins to divide.
## Source[^2]
- A stage of cell division. In mitosis the chromatids that separated from each other at anaphase collect at the poles of the spindle. A nuclear membrane forms around each group, producing two daughter nuclei with the same number and kind of chromosomes as the original cell nucleus. In the first telophase of meiosis, complete chromosomes from the pairs that separated at first anaphase form the daughter nuclei. The number of chromosomes in these nuclei is therefore half the number in the original one. In the second telophase, daughter nuclei are formed from chromatids (as in mitosis). In some organisms, the first telophase of meiosis is abbreviated or omitted (see INTERKINESIS).
