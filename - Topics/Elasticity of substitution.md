- The ratio of the proportional change in the relative quantities of two goods demanded to the proportional change in their relative prices. Let $p_{x}$ and $p_{y}$ be the prices of goods $X$ and $Y$, and $q_{x}$ and $q_{y}$ be the quantities demanded. The elasticity of substitution, $\sigma$, is defined as $$\sigma=-\left(\frac{d\left(q_{x} / q_{y}\right)}{q_{x} / q_{y}}\right) /\left(\frac{d\left(p_{x} / p_{y}\right)}{p_{x} / p_{y}}\right)=-\frac{d \ln \left(q_{x} / q_{y}\right)}{d \ln \left(p_{x} / p_{y}\right)}$$The minus sign is included to make $\sigma$ positive. The better substitutes any two goods are, the higher the $\sigma$ between them. For perfect substitutes $\sigma$ is infinite. If $\sigma>1$, as a good gets relatively cheaper it takes a larger share of total expenditure. If $\sigma<1$, as a good gets relatively cheaper it takes a smaller share of total expenditure. If $\sigma=1$, the two goods take constant shares of expenditure whatever their relative prices. The elasticity of substitution can be written in terms of marginal utility using the relation $p_{x} / p_{y}=U_{x} / U_{y}$.
