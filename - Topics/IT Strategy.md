- IT Strategy is an in-depth plan for how the organization will use IT to meet its business goals. Most IT strategy documents contain components such as a defined vision, IT processes, IT organization, and IT infrastructure.Â  This ensures that every department within the company is on the same page when it comes to IT practices. It also can help set budgets for IT and define how problems will be addressed.
