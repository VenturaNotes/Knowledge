- A sales and operations planning (S&OP) system of differentiation (SOD) is a software platform that supports S&OP processes. S&OP is a business task in which managers align their sales and marketing campaigns for new and existing products within the organization's supply chain. This includes forecasting how many products your customers will buy, as well as your ability to meet this demand. A system of differentiation (SOD) is defined as a dedicated software application for a specific process, function or capability (such as S&OP), which often makes up part of a larger enterprise software suite.
