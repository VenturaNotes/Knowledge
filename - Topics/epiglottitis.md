- $n$. an infection of the epiglottis, which swells and causes obstruction of the upper airways. Epiglottitis usually occurs in children between one and seven years old, who complain of drooling and breathing difficulties and are acutely unwell. The main bacterium that causes epiglottitis is Haemophilus influenzae, and the infection has become much less common since the Hib vaccine was introduced. Treatment consists of antibiotics and, if necessary, intubation. Children should be nursed in intensive care until the infection is under control.
