- Certain accounting treatments that may be followed when an entity uses financial derivatives to hedge against risk. Their purpose is to offset the extreme movements that may appear in a company's profit and loss account when a volatile derivative is measured using fair value accounting methods. The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (Section 12) limits the availability of such treatments; in general, hedge accounting may only be used with the less complex forms of derivative. UK listed companies should follow International Accounting Standard 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
