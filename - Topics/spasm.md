- $n$. a sustained involuntary muscular contraction, which may occur either as part of a generalized disorder, such as a SPASTIC PARALYSIS, or as a local response to an otherwise unconnected painful condition. Carpopedal spasm affects the muscles of the hands and feet and is caused by a reduction in the blood calcium level (often transitory, as in hyperventilation). See also MAIN D'ACCOUCHEUR.
