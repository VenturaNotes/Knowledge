- In a regression, the difference between the dependent variable and the regression function. It captures the combined effect of any deviation of the true functional form of the relationship between the dependent variable and the explanatory variables from the regression function; any random errors in the dependent variable and in the explanatory variables; and any variables that affect the dependent variable but are omitted from the regression function.
