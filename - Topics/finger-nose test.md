- a test for ataxia or cerebral lesions. Using the index finger, the patient alternately touches his or her nose and then the examiner's finger, which is shifted to a new position for each of the patient's movements. The test is positive if the patient misses a target or develops a tremor as the target is approached (intention tremor).
