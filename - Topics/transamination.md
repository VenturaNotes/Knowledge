## Source [^1]
- $n$. a process involved in the metabolism of amino acids in which amino groups $\left(-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)$ are transferred from amino acids to certain $\alpha$-keto acids, with the production of a second keto acid and amino acid. The reaction is catalysed by enzymes (see transaminase), which require pyridoxal phosphate as a coenzyme.
## Source[^2]
- A biochemical reaction in amino acid metabolism in which an amine group is transferred from an amino acid to a keto acid to form a new amino acid and keto acid. The coenzyme required for this reaction is pyridoxal phosphate.
