- (1) (margin; profit margin) For a single transaction or set of transactions, the excess of sales revenue over the costs of providing the goods or services sold. See GROSS PROFIT; NET PROFIT. 
- (2) For a period of trading, the surplus of net assets at the end of a period over the net assets at the start of that period, adjusted where relevant for amounts of capital injected or withdrawn by the proprietors. As profit is notoriously hard to define, it is not always possible to derive one single figure of profit for an organization from an accepted set of data.
