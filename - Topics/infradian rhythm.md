- A biorhythm whose period is more than 24 hours in length. For example, the body temperature of hibernating animals often shows periodic transient increases corresponding to brief periods of arousal. Also, the reproductive behavior of many animals follows a circalunar rhythm linked to the 29.5-day lunar cycle. See also BIOLOGICAL CLOCK.
