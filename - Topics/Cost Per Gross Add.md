- Cost Per Gross Add (CPGA) is an important business ratio that describes the cost of acquiring a new customer. Keeping your CPGA as low as possible is important for any business. In some instances, a CPGA can even demonstrate that acquiring new customers is not worth the expense. Items that factor into a CPGA include the salary of staff, materials, processing costs, and more.
