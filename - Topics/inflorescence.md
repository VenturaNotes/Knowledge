- A particular arrangement of flowers on a single main stalk of a plant. There are many different types of inflorescence, which are classified into two main groups depending on whether the tip of the flower axis goes on producing new flower buds during growth (see RACEMOSE INFLORESCENCE) or loses this ability (see CYMOSE INFLORESCENCE).
