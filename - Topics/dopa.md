## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. dihydroxyphenylalanine: a physiologically important compound that forms an intermediate stage in the synthesis of catecholamines (dopamine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline) from the essential amino acid tyrosine. It also plays a role itself in the functioning of certain parts of the brain. The laevorotatory form, levodopa, is administered for the treatment of parkinsonism, in which there is a deficiency of the neurotransmitter dopamine in the brain.
## Source[^2]
- (dihydroxyphenylalanine) A derivative of the amino acid tyrosine. It is found in particularly high levels in the adrenal glands and is a precursor in the synthesis of dopamine, noradrenaline, and adrenaline. The laevorotatory form, L-dopa (levodopa), is administered in the treatment of Parkinson's disease, in which brain levels of dopamine are reduced.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. An amino acid found in certain fruits and vegetables, especially broad beans, derived by oxidation from tyrosine, and abundantly present in the adrenal glands. It is a precursor of dopamine, adrenalin (epinephrine), and noradrenalin (norepinephrine). The laevorotatory (lefthanded) isomer L-dopa is used to treat Parkinson's disease. \[A contraction of its chemical name $d(i h y d r) o(x y) p(h e n y l) a($lanine$)]$
