- A representation of real numbers in which the position of the radix point is fixed. The position of the point determines the absolute precision of the representation. If the point is fixed at the right-hand end of the number then all of the fixed-point numbers are integers.
- Due to a number of difficulties, fixed-point arithmetic is rarely directly supported by programming languages. However, fixed-point arithmetic is implemented and used where needed; for example, for storing and tracking monetary values, or for decoding audio format on devices that do not support floating-point arithmetic.
