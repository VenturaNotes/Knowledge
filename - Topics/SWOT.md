- Acronym for strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. When planning to market of a new product a company needs to embark on a SWOT analysis to assess its strengths and weaknesses (internally) and the opportunities and threats facing it (externally). Internal strengths could be a good distribution system and adequate cash flow. Weaknesses might be identified as an already extended product line or poor servicing facilities. Opportunities could be consumer demand for a particular product or the vulnerability of a competitor, while threats might be forthcoming government legislation or diversification by a competitor. A SWOT analysis can also provide the framework for an organization's managerial position audit (see STRATEGIC MANAGEMENT).
