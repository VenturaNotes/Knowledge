- n. an anthracycline antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces peucetius caesius and used mainly in the treatment of acute leukaemias, Hodgkin's disease, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and various other forms of cancer. Doxorubicin acts by interfering with the production of DNA and RNA (see also CYTOTOXIC DRUG; TOPOISOMERASE INHIBITOR). Side-effects are those of other cytotoxic drugs; in addition, cardiotoxicity increases with cumulative dose of the drug. Use of alterative anthracyclines (e.g. epirubicin) or a liposomal preparation can reduce toxicity.
