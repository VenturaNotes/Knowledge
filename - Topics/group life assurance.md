- A life-assurance policy that covers a number of people, usually a group of employees or the members of a particular club or association. Often a single policy is issued and premiums are deducted from salaries or club membership fees. In return for an agreement that all employees or members join the scheme, insurers are prepared to ask only a few basic questions about the health of a person joining. However, with the advent of AIDS insurers are no longer prepared to waive all health enquiries, as they were some years ago.
