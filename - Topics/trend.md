- In time-series data, a long-term movement, with an upward or downward tendency. In an econometric model, a deterministic trend is introduced by including time as an exogenous variable, often in a linear or, more generally, in a polynomial form. A stochastic trend means that the model is an integrated process of some order, that is, it needs to be differenced to obtain stationarity.
