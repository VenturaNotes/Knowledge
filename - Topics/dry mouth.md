- a condition that occurs as a result of reduced salivary flow from a variety of causes, including therapeutic agents, Sj√∂gren's syndrome, connective-tissue diseases, diabetes, excision or absence of a major salivary gland, or radiotherapy to the head and neck that destroys the salivary glands. It causes swallowing and speech difficulties, inflamed gums, an increased incidence of dental caries, and loss of denture stability in people who have lost their teeth. Patients with their own teeth should be given strict dietary advice, chlorhexidine or fluoride mouthwashes, and sugar-free nonacidic saliva substitutes; they require special monitoring by their dentist. Medical name: xerostomia.
