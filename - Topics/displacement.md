- $n$. Moving something from its current position. In psychoanalysis, a defence mechanism involving redirection of emotional feelings from their original object to a substitute object related to the original one by a chain of associations. Although not essential to the concept as originally conceived by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939), and expounded further in 1900 in his book The Interpretation of Dreams (Standard Edition, IV-V, at pp. 180-1, 306-8) and in other writings, the substitute object may be less threatening than the original one, and the displacement may therefore have the effect of avoiding or reducing anxiety. Displacement is a characteristic mechanism of the primary process. In an article in the journal La Psychoanalyse in 1957, the French psychoanalyst Jacques Lacan (1901-81) related displacement to metonymy and the defence mechanism of condensation to metaphor.
