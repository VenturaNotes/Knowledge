- (EFTPOS) The automatic debiting of a purchase price from the customer's bank or credit-card account by a computer link between the checkout till and the bank or credit-card company. The system can only work when the customer has a debit card or credit card recognized by the retailer. In the now dominant chip and pin system the transaction is ratified by use of the customer's personal identification number (PIN), rather than by signature of a printed voucher. Many larger shops now permit customers buying goods by EFTPOS to withdraw cash as part of the same transaction. This cashback facility has advantages for shops, as it minimizes the amount of cash that needs to be counted, stored, and banked.
