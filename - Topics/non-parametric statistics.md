- The branch of statistics concerned with nonparametric statistical models. In non-parametric models the structure is determined from the data, without assuming a priori any particular functional form. For example, a histogram is a non-parametric estimate of a probability distribution. Non-parametric models are also called distributionfree or parameter-free.
