- The branch of statistics concerned with nonparametric statistical models. In non-parametric models the structure is determined from the data, without assuming a priori any particular functional form. For example, a histogram is a non-parametric estimate of a probability distribution. Non-parametric models are also called distributionfree or parameter-free.

- $n$. A branch of statistics that does not rely on assumptions about the parameters of the distributions from which scores are drawn and usually deals with data measured on ordinal scales or nominal scales to which arithmetic operations like addition and multiplication cannot meaningfully be applied. The term was introduced in 1942 by the Polish-born US statistician Jacob Wolfowitz (1910-81). Compare DISTRIBUTION-FREE TEST. \[From Latin non not + Greek para beside or beyond + Greek metron measure + English statistics]
