- (myelencephalon) the extension within the skull of the upper end of the spinal cord, forming the lowest part of the brainstem. Besides forming the major pathway for nerve impulses entering and leaving the skull, the medulla contains centres that are responsible for the regulation of the heart and blood vessels, respiration, salivation, and swallowing. Cranial nerves VI-XII leave the brain in this region.
