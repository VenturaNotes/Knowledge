- $n$. A concept introduced in 1958 by the Austrian-born US psychologist Fritz Heider (1896-1988) to denote a conceptual organization of a sequence of events in which some are identified as causes and others as effects. The concept was elaborated in 1977 by the Israeli-American psychologists Amos Tversky (1937-96) and Daniel Kahneman (born 1934), whose conceptual schemas include causal data (perceived as causes of the events of interest), diagnostic data (perceived as consequences of the events of interest), and also incidental data (perceived as neither causes nor consequences of the events of interest). See also attribution theory, COVARIATION PRINCIPLE, KELLEY's CUBE, SCHEMA.
