- All composition series for a finite group G have the same length and the same set of composition factors. For example, the three composition series for $C_{12} = \{e, g, ..., g^{11}\}$ are $$\begin {gather} \{e\} \lhd \{e,g^6\} \lhd \{e, g^3, g^6, g^9\} \lhd C_{12}, \\ \{e\} \lhd \{e,g^4,g^8\} \lhd \{e, g^2, g^4, g^6,g^8,g^{10}\} \lhd C_{12} \\ \{e\} \lhd \{e,g^6\} \lhd \{e, g^2, g^4, g^6, g^8,g^{10}\} \lhd C_{12} \end {gather}$$which have composition factors $C_2, C_2, C_3$ in some order. But knowledge of the composition factors says relatively little about the structure of G. For example, all five groups of order 12 have composition factors $C_2, C_2, C_3.$
