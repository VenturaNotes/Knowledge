- (punchcard) A rectangular paper card into which data could be encoded by punching patterns of holes. The holes were then sensed by a [[punched card reader]], which converted the punched patterns into binary code. Punched cards were used extensively for input, output, and file storage of data on early computer systems but are now obsolete.
