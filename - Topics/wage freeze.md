- An attempt by a government to counter inflation by fixing wages at their existing level for a specified period. For various reasons, including the use of overtime and bonuses to defeat the measure, this is no longer considered an effective policy. Wage restraint is a less rigidly applied attempt to control prices by obtaining union agreement to make only modest and essential claims for wage increases.
## Source[^2]
- A ban on changes in wages, imposed as part of a prices and incomes policy. As a temporary measure a wage freeze may help to cut inflation. It is very unlikely to be a practical long-term policy: the pattern of wage rates in force at the time the policy starts is unlikely to equilibrate labour markets even at the time, and will become steadily less suitable. A wage freeze is difficult to enforce, as job descriptions can be changed, and it operates unequally between workers on static wage rates and others on progressive salary scales.
