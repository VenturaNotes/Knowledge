- $n$. A type of intelligence test item or subtest in which the respondent has to choose which of several alternatives is the odd one out. A typical (difficult) example is: Which of the following is the odd one out? DET, DIS, EOJ, EOZ, NEK. Although various choices could be justified, the 'correct' answer to this item is $E O Z$, because this is an abbreviated female name written backwards, and all the others are abbreviated male names written backwards.
