- A solution made by dissolving copper(II) hydroxide in concentrated ammonia solution. It has a deep blue color and is used as a solvent for cellulose in the cuprammonium process for making rayon. When the cellulose solution is forced through spinnarets into an acid bath, fibers of cellulose are reformed. The reagent is named after Matthias Eduard Schweizer (1818-60), who found it in 1857.
