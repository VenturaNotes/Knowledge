- An endpoint protection platform (EPP) is a security platform that's implemented on remote devices to prevent cyber-attacks and security breaches. An EPP uses cloud-managed data to protect endpoint (remote) devices such as laptops, mobile phones, tablets, and desktops from malware attacks, malicious activity, and other types of security threats.
