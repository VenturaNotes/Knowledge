- $n$. The property of having several names. English has no equivalents for the many words for camel in Arabic, snow in the language of the Inuit Eskimos of Greenland, Canada, and Northern Alaska, or hole in the Australian aboriginal Pintupi; but on the other hand few languages have the polyonymy that English has for different types of vehicles (car, lorry, bus, motorbike, go-cart, and so on). See also linguistic determinism. Compare POLYSEMY. polyonymous adj. \[From Greek polys many + onoma a name]
