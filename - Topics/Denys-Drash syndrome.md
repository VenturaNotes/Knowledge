- a rare disorder consisting of the triad of nephroblastoma (Wilmsâ€™ tumour), congenital nephropathy, and intersex disorders, resulting from mutations in the Wilm's tumour suppressor gene (WT1). Incomplete forms exist; congenital nephropathy, with diffuse mesangial sclerosis, is the constant feature with either Wilms' tumour or intersex disorders, usually in the form of male pseudohermaphroditism. \[P. Denys (20th century), French physician; A. Drash (20th century), British physician]
