- Able to be known without experience, i.e. the truth or otherwise can be argued by logic from agreed definitions. For example, the probabilities of the score when tossing a fair die are deduced from the principle of equally likely outcomes
## Source[^2]
- Literally translated from Latin: from what is before. In the economic literature it is used to indicate that a claim is true on the basis of earlier reasoning rather than empirical evidence.
## Source[^3]
- adj. adv. Of, relating to, or denoting propositions (1), arguments, or concepts that proceed from theoretical deduction rather than from observation or experience, hence being based on inference rather than observation. An a priori proposition can be known to be true or false without reference to observation or experience, whereas the truth or falsity of an a posteriori proposition is contingent and can be established only by empirical test. An a priori argument seeks to deduce conclusions from a priori premises, whereas an a posteriori argument proceeds from a posteriori premises. An a priori concept is one that is not derived from experience: the empiricist philosophers claimed that all concepts are empirical and a posteriori, but the Greek philosopher Plato (?427-?347 BC) and rationalists such as the German philosopher and mathematician Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1646-1716) claimed that some concepts, such as those of substance, cause, equality, likeness, and difference, are a priori, and the German idealist philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) argued that observation and experience themselves presuppose a priori knowledge. The terms a priori and a posteriori were introduced by scholastic philosophers of the late medieval period and were popularized in the 17th century by Leibniz and the French philosopher Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650). See also analytic statement. Compare a posteriori. \[Latin: from what comes before]
