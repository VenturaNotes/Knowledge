- abbrev. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy, a progressive and ultimately fatal disease that attacks the nervous system of cattle and may infect human beings, causing new-variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease. It is believed by most authorities to be a prion disease, but according to an alternative theory it is an autoimmune disease, similar to multiple sclerosis, caused by the immune system's reaction to the bacterium Acinetobacter, a common microbe found in water, soil, sewage, and in the skin of cattle and human beings, where it infects open wounds and cuts and mimics the molecular structure of a brain tissue protein, causing the immune system to attack both the bacteria and normal brain tissue. Its non-technical name is mad cow disease.
