- abbrev. Behaviors, affective processes, sensations, images, cognitions, and interpersonal relationships springing from drugs or biological factors. This acronym summarizes the core elements of human life and basic modalities of response to situations in multimodal therapy, according to which an intervention is most likely to be effective if it follows the order of the response pattern of the patient or client. Thus, if the firstorder anxiety response is in the sensory modality (for example, churning of the stomach), then sensory techniques such as relaxation or biofeedback are used as initial treatments.
