- (Ferdinand Ludwig Philipp) (1845-1918) Mathematician responsible for the establishment of set theory and for profound developments in the notion of the infinite. He was born in St Petersburg but spent most of his life at the University of Halle in Germany. In 1873, he showed that the set of rational numbers is denumerable. He also showed that the set of real numbers is uncountable. Later he fully developed his theory of infinite sets (see CARdinal arithmetic, cardinal number). The latter part of his life was clouded by repeated mental illness.
