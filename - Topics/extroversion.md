- n. 
- (1) (extraversion) an enduring personality trait characterized by interest in the outside world rather than the self. People high in extroversion (extroverts), as measured by questionnaires and tests, are gregarious and outgoing, prefer to change activities frequently, and are not susceptible to permanent conditioning. Extroversion was first described by Carl Jung as a tendency to action rather than thought, to scientific rather than philosophical interests, and to emotional rather than intellectual reactions. Eysenck used it as one of the main personality traits in his widely used personality questionnaire. Compare INTROVERSION. 
- (2) a turning inside out of a hollow organ, such as the uterus (which sometimes occurs after childbirth).
