- In a linear regression model, this is the proportion of sample variation in the dependent variable explained by the regression. It is denoted by $R^{2}$ and is equal to the squared correlation coefficient between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the estimated regression equation. The coefficient of determination is only meaningful if the regression contains an intercept term.

- $n$. In statistics, a measure of the goodness of fit (1) of a set of scores to a linear model. It is defined as the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the model. It can range in value from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating perfect fit. Symbol: $R^{2}$.
