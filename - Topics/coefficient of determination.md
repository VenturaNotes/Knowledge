- In a linear regression model, this is the proportion of sample variation in the dependent variable explained by the regression. It is denoted by $R^{2}$ and is equal to the squared correlation coefficient between the observed values of the dependent variable and the values predicted by the estimated regression equation. The coefficient of determination is only meaningful if the regression contains an intercept term.
