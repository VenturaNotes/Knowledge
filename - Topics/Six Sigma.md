- Six Sigma is a methodology for improving the quality of products and services. It's based on the belief that if you can measure something, you can improve it. Techniques include identifying defects and then removing them from the process, reducing variation between products or services offered by different suppliers, and improving customer satisfaction by focusing on their needs rather than what's easiest for you to provide.

- A quality-control system first developed at the US telecoms company Motorola in 1986 and later adopted by many large industrial businesses, including General Electric. The process systematizes production with the objective of reducing flaws to 3.4 defects per million. It involves five key stages, often summarized in the acronym DMAIC (pronounced 'duh-may-ick'): (i) define goals; (ii) measure the current process; (iii) analyze data; (iv) improve the process; and (v) control future production so that faults are eradicated before they can occur.
