- Six Sigma is a methodology for improving the quality of products and services. It's based on the belief that if you can measure something, you can improve it. Techniques include identifying defects and then removing them from the process, reducing variation between products or services offered by different suppliers, and improving customer satisfaction by focusing on their needs rather than what's easiest for you to provide.
