- $n$. The process by which two phonemes, which by definition have the power to distinguish minimal pairs, can become indistinguishable. For example, in English /p/ and /b/ are different phonemes, as can be seen in the different meanings of pan and ban or cap and cab, but following /s/ this opposition is neutralized, and from a phonetic point of view span could just as well be written sban.
