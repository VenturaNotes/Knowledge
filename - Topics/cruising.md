- $n$. (in child development) taking steps while holding onto furniture for support. At first, the toddler probably faces the furniture and shuffles sideways. Cruising usually begins in the 9th month, but can begin as early as 7 months and as late as 12 months. Babies generally progress from sitting to crawling to supported standing to cruising. Regardless of developmental order, cruising always comes after supported standing and before unsupported walking.
