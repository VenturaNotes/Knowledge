- $n$. A phenomenon that occurs when a speech sound does not match the shape of the lips producing it, as when a sound corresponding to the usual pronunciation of the word gay is dubbed on to a video image of a person uttering the word bay, causing the listener to hear a word intermediate between the two (day). This effect shows that the visual channel conveys important information not just to deaf people but also to listeners with normal hearing. \[Named after the Scottish psychologist Harry McGurk (1936-98) who co-authored the first article on it, entitled 'Hearing Lips and Seeing Voices' in the journal Nature in 1976]
