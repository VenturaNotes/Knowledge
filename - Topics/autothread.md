- A facility provided on some open-reel tape transports whereby magnetic tape is automatically threaded from the file reel through the tape path and secured to the hub of the take-up reel see also (AUTOLOAD). The first autothreading transports required the tape reels to be manually mounted on the transport hub. More recent types only require the tape reel to be 'posted' through a slot in the transport housing.
