- (lignocaine) $n$. a widely used local anaesthetic administered by injection for minor surgery and dental procedures. For the latter it is normally used in combination with adrenaline to achieve better and longer anaesthesia. Alone or in combination with other agents, it can also be applied directly to the eye, throat, and mouth, as it is absorbed through mucous membranes, and to the skin. Lidocaine is also injected intravenously to treat conditions involving abnormal heart rhythm (ventricular arrhythmias), particularly following myocardial infarction. When used as a local anaesthetic, side-effects are uncommon.
