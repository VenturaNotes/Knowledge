- $n$. The threshold rate at which light from an intermittent or fluctuating source begins to be seen as continuous or fused, the usual criterion being the viewer's report of seeing it as continuous 50 per cent of the time. It depends on the luminance of the image, its angular size, and the level of adaptation of the eyes, but its minimum value is about 16 hertz or cycles per second, and it is often taken as approximately 30 hertz. Television presents 25 still images per second (British standard) or 30 per second (US standard), but each image is given twice to raise the flicker rate to 50 or 60 per second, comfortably above the critical flicker frequency. Also called critical fusion frequency (cff) or flicker fusion frequency (fff ). See also brightness enhancement, ePIscotister, Ferry-Porter law, flicker. See also bip. Compare auditory flutter fusion. cff abbrev.
