- $n$. the presence in the blood of an abnormally high concentration of calcium. There are many causes, including excessive ingestion of vitamin D, overactivity of the parathyroid glands, and malignant disease. Malignant hypercalcaemia results from the secretion by the tumor of substances (most commonly parathyroid hormone-related protein) that stimulate bone resorption or from bone metastases causing localized destruction and release of calcium into the bloodstream. Hypercalcaemia may also occur as an inherited congenital condition, for example familial benign (or hypocalciuric) hypercalcaemia or Williams syndrome. Compare HYPOCALCAEMIA.
