- diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance that is diagnosed during pregnancy (see GlUCOSE TOLERANCE TEST). Women at increased risk of gestational diabetes include those with a personal history of the condition, obesity, or a family history of diabetes, and those who have had a previously unexplained stillbirth. In most cases gestational diabetes resolves at the end of the pregnancy, but such women are at increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes thereafter. It is treated by dietary control with or without insulin or metformin to avoid the fetal complications of macrosomia and hypoglycaemia. See also PREGESTATIONAL DIABETES.
