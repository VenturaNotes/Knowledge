- A measure of a system's ability to do work. The Gibbs free energy (or Gibbs function), $G$, is defined by $G=H-T S$, where $G$ is the energy liberated or absorbed in a reversible process at constant pressure and constant temperature $(T), H$ is the enthalpy and $S$ the entropy of the system. Changes in Gibbs free energy, $\Delta G$, are useful in indicating the conditions under which a chemical reaction will occur. If $\Delta G$ is positive the reaction will only occur if energy is supplied to force it away from the equilibrium position (i.e. when $\Delta G$ $=0$ ). If $\Delta G$ is negative the reaction will proceed spontaneously to equilibrium.
