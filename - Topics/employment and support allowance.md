- (in Britain) an allowance payable to people under state retirement age who are unable to work because of illness or disability. Entitlement depends on either an adequate record of National Insurance contributions or satisfying income-related criteria. An assessment-phase allowance is paid during the first 13 weeks of a claim, and eligible claimants are paid the main-phase rate following a work capability assessment. The part of this allowance based on income is currently being replaced by a component of universal credit; the part based on National Insurance contributions will remain in place.
