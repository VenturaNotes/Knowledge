- $n$. possession of a high level of intellectual and technical expertise with a commitment to public service and the ability to practise autonomously within the regulations of the discipline. It calls for a special set of values, behaviors, and relationships including respect and care for oneself as well as patients and others, honesty, integrity, reliability, responsibility, communication, collaboration, compassion, empathy, altruism, and advocacy - but also self-awareness and a knowledge of limits (see burnout). Major shortcomings might be reported to a professional body (such as the General Medical Council for UK doctors).
