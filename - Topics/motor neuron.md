## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- one of the units (neurons) that goes to make up the nerve pathway between the brain and an effector organ, such as a skeletal muscle. An upper motor neuron has a cell body in the brain and an axon that extends into the spinal cord, where it ends in synapses. It is thus entirely within the central nervous system. A lower motor neuron, on the other hand, has a cell body in the spinal cord or brainstem and an axon that extends outwards in a cranial or spinal motor nerve to reach an effector.
## Source[^2]
- A neuron that transmits nerve impulses from the central nervous system to an effector organ (such as a muscle or gland) and thereby initiates a physiological response (e.g. muscle contraction).
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any of the nerve cells of the peripheral nervous system that transmit signals from the motor cortex or the spinal cord to the muscles or glands (see illustration). Also called an efferent neuron. See alpha motor neuron, gamma motor neuron, Renshaw Cell. Compare MOTONEURON. \[From Latin motor a mover, from motus moved, from movere to move]
