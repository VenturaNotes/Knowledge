- an acute illness caused by extreme exposure to rays emitted by radioactive substances, e.g. X-rays or gamma rays. Very high doses can cause death within hours. Lower doses, which may eventually prove fatal, cause nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea followed after a week or more by bleeding and other symptoms of damage to the bone marrow, loss of hair, and bloody diarrhoea. Some of the milder symptoms can occur after radiotherapy during treatment of cancer.
