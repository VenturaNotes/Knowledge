- AOL instant messenger (AIM) was one of the first instant messaging services around. It allowed individuals to instantly message each other and communicate via text message. Later versions of the service expanded, allowing individuals to send files, pictures, and emojis. The service originally came with America Online (AOL), but later expanded to be a free, stand-alone service. It was discontinued in 2017.
