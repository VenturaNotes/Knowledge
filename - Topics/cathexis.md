- $n$. In psychoanalysis, the emotional charge associated with an instinct (3), or the process of investing psychic energy in a part of the body or an instinctual object. The Austrian physician Josef Breuer (1842-1925) and Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced the concept in 1895 in their book Studies on Hysteria (Standard Edition, II). The original German word used by Breuer and Freud was Besetzung, an everyday word meaning occupation; the word cathexis was coined in 1922 by Freud's translator James Strachey (1887-1967), who revealed that Freud considered it too technical (Standard Edition III, p. 63, note 2). A word more in harmony with the German is investment. See also economic, hypercathexis. Compare COUNTERCATHEXIS, DECATHEXIS. cathect $v b$. To load with psychic energy through cathexis. \[From Greek kathexis occupation, from kathechein to hold fast]
