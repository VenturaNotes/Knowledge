- A business development representative (BDR) refers to a sales representative that focuses primarily on developing leads through tactics such as cold calling, networking, or interacting on social media. They also perform tasks such as market research. Unlike more traditional sales representative positions, the BDR does not aim to seal the deal with a potential lead. Instead, their goal is to move their leads along to a more experienced member of the sales team, such as an account executive, to convert and finalize the most promising leads.
