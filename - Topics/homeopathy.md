- (homoeopathy) $n$. a complementary therapy based on the theory that 'like cures like'. It involves a belief that conditions may be treated with a tiny dose of a substance, so diluted as to be indistinguishable from pure water, that in larger doses would normally cause or aggravate that condition. A second principle is a process of dilution and shaking known as 'succussion'. Homeopathy was developed by a German doctor, Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), in 1796. It was described as 'scientifically implausible' by the UK's Chief Medical Officer in 2010 and is not recommended by NICE. —homeopathic adj. —homeopathist $n$.

- $n$. An unconventional or alternative form of drug therapy for physical and mental disorders devised by the German physician Christian Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), based on the dictum of the Greek father of medicine Hippocrates (?460-?377 BC) that 'like cures like' (similia similibus curantur), in which a drug that produces a particular pattern of symptoms in a healthy person is used in an extremely dilute form to treat disorders characterized by similar symptoms. Successive dilutions of the drug produce a solution containing virtually no molecules of the original active substance but are believed to have therapeutic properties none the less. Also spelt homoeopathy. See also hormesis. Compare allopathy. homeopath or homoeopath $n$. One who practises homeopathy. homeopathic or homoeopathic adj. \[From Greek homoio- similar to, from homos the same + pathos suffering]
