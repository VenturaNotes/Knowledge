- (homoeopathy) $n$. a complementary therapy based on the theory that 'like cures like'. It involves a belief that conditions may be treated with a tiny dose of a substance, so diluted as to be indistinguishable from pure water, that in larger doses would normally cause or aggravate that condition. A second principle is a process of dilution and shaking known as 'succussion'. Homeopathy was developed by a German doctor, Samuel Hahnemann (1755-1843), in 1796. It was described as 'scientifically implausible' by the UK's Chief Medical Officer in 2010 and is not recommended by NICE. —homeopathic adj. —homeopathist $n$.
