- Any of a class of flavonoids having the basic $\mathrm{C}_{6}\text{-}\mathrm{C}_{3}\text{-}\mathrm{C}_{6}$ arrangement but in which the middle three carbon atoms do not form a closed ring, in contrast to other flavonoids. Chalcones are important precursors in the synthesis of anthocyanin pigments and other flavonoids in plants; their formation is catalysed by the enzyme chalcone synthase.
