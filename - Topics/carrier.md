- A person or firm that carries goods or people from place to place, usually under a contract and for a fee. Under UK law a common carrier is one who undertakes to provide a public service; such a carrier must carry any persons or goods (within certain restrictions) on regular routes; must charge a reasonable rate; and is liable for all loss or damage to goods in transit. All other carriers are private carriers; they reserve the right to accept or reject employment and owe only a duty of reasonable care.
