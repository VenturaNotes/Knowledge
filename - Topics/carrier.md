- A person or firm that carries goods or people from place to place, usually under a contract and for a fee. Under UK law a common carrier is one who undertakes to provide a public service; such a carrier must carry any persons or goods (within certain restrictions) on regular routes; must charge a reasonable rate; and is liable for all loss or damage to goods in transit. All other carriers are private carriers; they reserve the right to accept or reject employment and owe only a duty of reasonable care.

- n. 
- (1) a person who harbours the microorganisms causing a particular disease without experiencing signs or symptoms of infection and who can transmit the disease to others. 
- (2) (in genetics) a person who bears a gene for an abnormal trait without showing any signs of the disorder; the carrier is usually heterozygous for the gene concerned, which is recessive. 
- (3) an animal, usually an insect, that passively transmits infectious organisms from one animal to another or from an infected animal to a human being. See also VECTOR.

- (1) (in medicine) An individual who harbours a particular disease-causing microorganism without ill-effects and who can transmit the microorganism to others. Compare VECTOR. 
- (2) (in genetics) An individual with an allele for some defective condition that is masked by a normal dominant allele. Such individuals therefore do not suffer from the condition themselves but they may pass on the defective allele to their offspring. In humans, women may be carriers of such conditions as red-green color blindness and haemophilia, the alleles for which are carried on the X chromosomes (see SEX LINKAGE). 
- (3) (in immunology) A protein that covalently binds to a hapten to form a hapten-carrier conjugate. Unlike the hapten alone, the conjugate can cause the immune system to produce antibodies against the hapten, against the carrier, and against the hapten-carrier combination. 
- (4) (in biochemistry) See CARRIER MOLECULE; HYDROGEN CARRIER.
## Source[^4]
- (genetic) $n$. In genetics and pathology, an organism that does not itself manifest a particular trait or disease but is capable of passing it on to others.
