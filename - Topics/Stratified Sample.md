- A sample obtained by taking a sample from each subgroup of population when the population is not homogeneous and can be classified into subgroups according to some factor(s). Each subgroup is then represented in the same proportion in the sample as in the entire population. Stratified sampling is appropriate when the measurement of interest is expected to vary across subgroups. See also QUOTA SAMPLE; RANDOM SAMPLE.
