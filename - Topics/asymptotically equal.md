- Two functions $f(x)$ and $g(x)$ are asymptotically equal if $f(x) / g(x)$ has limit 1 as $x$ tends to $\infty$, written $f(x) \sim g(x)$. For example $(x+1)^{3}(x+2)^{4} \sim x^{7}$. Being asymptotically equal implies something about the relative size of two functions and does not imply they are approximately equal; in the example, the difference between $(x+1)^{3}(x+2)^{4}$ and $x^{7}$ becomes arbitrarily large as $x$ increases.
