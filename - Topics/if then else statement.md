- The most basic conditional construct in a programming language, allowing selection between two alternatives, dependent on the truth or falsity of a given condition. Most languages also provide an if...then construct to allow conditional execution of a single statement or group of statements. Primitive languages, such as Basic in its original form, restrict the facility to a conditional transfer of control, e.g.$$\text { 'IF } \mathrm{A}=0 \text { THEN } 330^{\prime}$$which is reminiscent of the conditional jump provided in the order code of every CPU. See also CONDITIONAL.
