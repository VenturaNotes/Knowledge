- A major terrestrial biome in which the dominant plants are species of grass; the rainfall is insufficient to support extensive growth of trees, which are also suppressed by grazing animals. Tropical grassland (savanna), which covers much of Africa south of the Sahara, has widely spaced trees, such as acacias and baobabs, and supports large herds of grazing animals and their predators. Temperate grasslands, such as the steppes of Asia, the prairies of North America, and the pampas of South America, have few trees and are largely used for agriculture.
