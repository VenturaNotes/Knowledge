- A cyber incident response plan (CIRP) is created to respond to potential computer incidents, such as hacking, data breaches, viruses, ransomware, or network failures. Preparing for an incident, data recovery, notification to affected parties, and backup plans are standard components of a CIRP. These plans are often developed in consultation with cyber professionals.
