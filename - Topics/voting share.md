- An ordinary share in a company giving the owner the right to vote at the company's general meetings. This is distinguished from a non-voting share, which gives the holder equal rights to information about the company and to dividends, but no vote. In some countries companies can set a maximum on the number of votes which can be cast by any one shareholder, regardless of the number of shares held.
