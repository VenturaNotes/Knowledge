- The national income of a country, or region, divided by its population. Per capita income can be calculated per person, counting everybody; per adult; or per 'adult equivalent', using weights to count children of various ages as equivalent to fractions of an adult. Countries or regions with a high proportion of children rank lower when per capita income is compared using a measure which gives some weight to children than using income per adult.
