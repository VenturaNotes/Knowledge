- A sorting algorithm that stores, for each sortkey, the number of keys less than the given key. If $N_j$ denotes the number of keys less than the $j$th key then (assuming that keys are unique) the $j$th record should be in position $N_j+1$ in a file sorted into ascending order of the keys. This is a simple but inefficient algorithm.
