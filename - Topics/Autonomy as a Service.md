- Autonomy as a service (AaaS) uses artificial intelligence (AI), intelligent automation, self-service applications, and event/pattern detection to provide innovative levels of autonomy across service interactions. These services may support or assist existing service processes or automate them fully. AaaS solutions allow businesses to anticipate customer needs and connect with their customer base, often without the need of any human intervention at all.
