- Track and trace technology help manufacturers monitor and trace the location of their product as it makes its way through the supply chain. This can be done in many phases of the process. It can be done by either attaching unique identifiers (or UIDs) to the product or material, by capturing events at different points in the supply chain (such as important drop-offs or arrivals), or by performing analytics and reporting on the information.
