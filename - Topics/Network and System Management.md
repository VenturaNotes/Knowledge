- Network and system management (NSM), also called network systems management, is the combined management of IT functions and networks within an organization. Businesses have in-house experts or outsourced teams to deal with NSM. These teams usually set up networks, administer them, and provide maintenance and troubleshooting services. They may also recommend and install upgrades and ensure all the aspects of business systems work on the relevant networks. In addition, NSM involves creating and maintaining effective cybersecurity mechanisms.
