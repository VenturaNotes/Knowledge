To train an infant to be self-reliant and to sleep on its own by placing it in its crib, leaving the room, and ignoring its crying for at least 20 minutes, then returning, patting it but not picking it up, and leaving quickly. When this influential but controversial child-care practice is followed, the procedure is repeated every night, increasing by five minutes per night the waiting period before responding to the infant's crying with patting. Ferberization $n$. The practice of Ferberizing. \[Named after the US paediatric sleep researcher Richard Ferber (born 1944) who developed it in 1986]
