- An effect occurring in the atmosphere because of the presence of certain gases (greenhouse gases) that absorb infrared radiation. Light and ultraviolet radiation from the sun are able to penetrate the atmosphere and warm the earth's surface. This energy is re-radiated as infrared radiation, which, because of its longer wavelength, is absorbed by such substances as carbon dioxide. The greenhouse effect is a natural phenomenon, without which the earth's climate would be much more hostile to life. However, emissions of carbon dioxide from human activities (e.g. farming, industry, and transport) have increased markedly in the last 150 years or so. The overall effect is that the average temperature of the earth and its atmosphere is increasing (so-called global warming). The effect is similar to that occurring in a greenhouse, where light and long-wavelength ultraviolet radiation can pass through the glass into the greenhouse but the infrared radiation is absorbed by the glass and part of it is re-radiated into the greenhouse.
- The greenhouse effect is seen as a major environmental hazard. Average increases in temperature are already changing weather patterns, affecting agricultural output (see CLIMATE CHANGE), and causing the polar ice caps to melt, with a corresponding rise in sea level. Carbon dioxide, emitted e.g. from coal-fired power stations and car exhausts, is the main greenhouse gas. Other contributory pollutants are nitrogen oxides, ozone, methane, and chlorofluorocarbons. Many countries have now agreed targets to limit emissions of greenhouse gases, e.g. by switching to renewable energy sources. See also POLLUTION.
