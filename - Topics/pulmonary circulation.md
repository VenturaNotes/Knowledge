- a system of blood vessels effecting transport of blood between the heart and lungs. Deoxygenated blood leaves the right ventricle by the pulmonary artery and is carried to the alveolar capillaries of the lungs. Gaseous exchange occurs, with carbon dioxide leaving the circulation and oxygen entering. The oxygenated blood then passes into small veins leading to the pulmonary veins, which leave the lungs and return blood to the left atrium of the heart. The oxygenated blood can then be pumped around the body via the systemic circulation.

- The part of the circulatory system of birds and mammals that transports deoxygenated blood from the right side of the heart to the lungs and returns oxygenated blood to the left side of the heart. Compare SYSTEMIC CIRCULATION. See DOUBLE CIRCULATION.
