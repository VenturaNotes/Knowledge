- (LUTS) symptoms occurring during urine storage, voiding, or immediately after. These include frequency, urgency, nocturia, incontinence, hesitation, intermittency, terminal dribble, dysuria, and postmicturition dribble. These symptoms used to be known as prostatism. Sometimes they are due to benign prostatic hyperplasia (see PROSTATE GLAND), but they may be due to detrusor overactivity, excessive drinking, diuresis due to poorly controlled diabetes, or a urethral stricture.
