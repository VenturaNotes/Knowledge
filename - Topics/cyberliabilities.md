- The risks to an organization from misuse of the Internet and e-mail by its staff. These include the risks of virus infection, leakage of confidential information, and damage to a company's reputation resulting from unofficial e-mails or use of social media (e.g. the forwarding of jokes that might be found offensive). The risks can be minimized by developing clear policies on appropriate and inappropriate use and the installation of software to check for viruses and content. If such measures are neglected, directors or senior managers may be liable in law for the actions of employees (e.g. in sending libellous or racist e-mails). See ACCEPTABLE USE POLICY.
