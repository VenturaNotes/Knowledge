- (membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis) a renal disease characterized by changes in the glomeruli with mesangial cell proliferation and thickening of the capillary wall (see JUXTAGLOMERULAR APPARATUS). Three types are distinguished. Type 1 is associated with immune deposits in the subendothelial space and the mesangial cells, and may sometimes be associated with cryoglobulinaemia (see CRYOGLOBULIN) and infection with the hepatitis C virus. Type 2, also known as dense deposit disease, is associated with a ribbon of electron-dense material within the glomerular basement membrane. Type 3 is associated with immune deposits in the subendothelium, the basement membrane, and the subepithelial spaces. All three types have a variable presentation, ranging from asymptomatic abnormalities of the urinary sediment through nephrotic syndrome to subacute renal failure. Apart from treatment of any coexisting hepatitis C, there is no consensus regarding specific treatment of these conditions.
