- Given a vector space V over a field F, the (algebraic) dual space $V^*$ is the vector space of linear functionals $\varphi$: $V \to F$ with addition and scalar multiplication defined pointwise. $$\begin{align}(\varphi_1 + \varphi_2)(v) &= \varphi_1(v) + \varphi_2(v) \\ (c\varphi)(v) &= c(\varphi(v)).\end{align}$$If V is finite-dimensional, then $V^*$ has the same dimension (see dual basis).
