- Change in control of a company through its previous shareholders being bought out by new owners. These may already be connected with the firm: in a management buy-out the firm is bought by its existing managers. A buy-out may alternatively be undertaken by outsiders. Finance may come from the purchasers' own resources, or from loans; in a leveraged buy-out part of the price is raised by fixed-interest loans.
