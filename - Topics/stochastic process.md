- A set of random variables whose values vary with time (or sometimes in space). Examples include populations affected by births and deaths, the length of a queue (see QUEUING THEORY), or the amount of water in a reservoir. [[stochastic model|stochastic models]] are models in which random variation is of major importance, in contrast to deterministic models. Stochastic processes give theoretical explanations for many probability distributions, and underlie the analysis of time series data.
## Source[^2]
- A family, or a collection of random variables, indexed by time. It is said to be a discrete process, or a discrete time process, if the time index only takes integer values (typically, $0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots$ ), and a continuous process, or a continuous time process, if the time index takes a continuous range of real values (finite or infinite).
