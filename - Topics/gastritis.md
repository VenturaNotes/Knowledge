- $n$. inflammation of the lining (mucosa) of the stomach. Acute erosive (reactive) gastritis is caused by ingesting excess alcohol, protracted NSAID use, or following major surgery, illness, or burns. Chronic gastritis is predominantly caused by Helicobacter pylori infection, but there are associations with smoking, chronic alcoholism, and biliary reflux. Atrophic gastritis, in which the stomach lining is atrophied, may complicate chronic gastritis or may occur secondary to autoimmune disease, often in association with pernicious anaemia, and is strongly associated with the development of gastric cancer.
