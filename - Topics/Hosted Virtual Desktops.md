- Hosted virtual desktops (HVD) help create a completely virtual environment. These virtual machines operate on a cloud-based server that enables data and applications to be accessed from any device. Essentially, an HVD allows users to bring the contents of a physical PC along with them wherever they go without the need to access the actual computer.
