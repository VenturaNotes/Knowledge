- (TDF; SRY protein) A protein that plays a crucial role in sex determination in mammals. It is encoded by the SRY (sex reversal on Y) gene on the Y chromosome, and switches embryonic development from the default female pathway to the male pathway, by driving testis formation. The male developmental cascade is then consolidated by secretion of the male sex hormone testosterone by the testes.
