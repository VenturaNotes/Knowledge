## Source [^1]
- Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS)Â lets SMBs rent computing resources on a pay-as-you-go basis. These resources include:
	- Servers
	- Storage systems
	- Networks
	- Data centers
- IaaS vendors often provide these resources via the cloud. Businesses don't have to install or manage the technology to perform day-to-day IT tasks; the service provider takes care of maintenance, data security, and upgrades on their behalf. Businesses, however, still need to manage their operating systems and the amount of data they use.
