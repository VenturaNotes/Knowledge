- (1) A data input and/or output device that is connected to a controlling processor to which it is subservient and usually remote. There is a very wide range of terminal types. The VDU is frequently used as a terminal by which a user can input queries or instructions and receive instructions. The information may be in the form of text or it may be mainly graphical. Terminals designed for a particular environment and business activity come under a general heading of application terminals. If the terminal has a built-in capability to store and manipulate data it is classed as an intelligent terminal; without this capability terminals are classed as dumb.

- A terminal is a device that combines the functions of a computer and display. Terminals come in three forms—dumb, smart, and intelligent—with each one offering different capabilities and uses. Dumb terminals have no processing power or memory and rely on a host computer system to which they are attached. Smart terminals can perform simple functions but send most work back to the host for processing before displaying it on screen or printing it as output. Finally, intelligent terminals can execute software locally without external resources from other systems (i.e., servers). This lets them perform tasks independently while connecting over networks such as Wi-Fi for internet access.

- A computer input and output device. It commonly consists of a keyboard and display screen, connected to the computer. Terminals that are distant from the computer and connected to it by a communications link are called remote terminals. Terminals with some computing power, often incorporating a microprocessor, are called intelligent terminals. Specialized terminals have been developed for use in banking and retailing.
