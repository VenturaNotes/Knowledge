- (1) A data input and/or output device that is connected to a controlling processor to which it is subservient and usually remote. There is a very wide range of terminal types. The VDU is frequently used as a terminal by which a user can input queries or instructions and receive instructions. The information may be in the form of text or it may be mainly graphical. Terminals designed for a particular environment and business activity come under a general heading of application terminals. If the terminal has a built-in capability to store and manipulate data it is classed as an intelligent terminal; without this capability terminals are classed as dumb.
