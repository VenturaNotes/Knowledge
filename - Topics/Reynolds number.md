- For a viscous flow with speed $u$, viscosity $v$ passing an object of length $a$, the ratio $R = ua/v$ is a dimensionless (see DIMENSIONS) quantity called the Reynolds number. For low Reynolds numbers, uniform or laminar flows tend to occur, whereas for high Reynolds numbers turbulent flow is common.
