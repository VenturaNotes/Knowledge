- (1) The procedure adopted if a bill of exchange has been dishonoured by non-acceptance or by non-payment. Not later than the next business day after the day on which it was dishonoured, the holder has to hand it to a notary public to be noted. The notary re-presents the bill; if it is still unaccepted or unpaid, the circumstances are noted in a register and also on a notarial ticket, which is attached to the bill. The noting can then, if necessary, be extended to a protest. 
- (2) In advertising research, noticing a particular advertisement when first looking through a newspaper or magazine in which it appears. See NOTING SCORE.
