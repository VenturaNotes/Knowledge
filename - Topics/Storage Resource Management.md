- Storage resource management (SRM) is a method of analysis for how data is maintained, stored, and accessed. Appropriate SRM can provide a variety of information in real time, including where information is, how much storage is available, the overall performance of that storage, and more. It can be very useful for businesses that provide or use data-heavy services.
