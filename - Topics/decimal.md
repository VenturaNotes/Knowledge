### Decimal to Binary Example
- To convert a number to binary, just divide the number repeatedly by 2, read the remainder (0 or 1), and record from bottom to top to get the binary representation
- To convert 5 to binary
	- $5 \div 2 = 2$ remainder 1
	- $2 \div 2 = 1$ remainder 0
	- $1 \div 2 = 0$ remainder 1
	- Reading remainders bottom-up: $101_2$
