- A plant that grows upon another plant but is neither parasitic on it nor rooted in the ground. Epiphytes include many mosses and lichens and some cacti, bromeliads, and tropical orchids. They absorb moisture and nutrients via adventitious or aerial roots, from rain, dew, or surface debris on their host plant. Often the roots are adapted to cling to the host for support and over time these may damage the host.
