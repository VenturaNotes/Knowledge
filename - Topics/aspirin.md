- (acetylsalicylic acid) $n$. a drug that relieves pain and also reduces inflammation and fever. Largely superseded by modern anti-inflammatory agents (see NSAID), aspirin is now most commonly taken regularly in low doses as an antiplatelet drug. In this role it reduces the risk of vascular thrombosis that may lead to events such as heart attack or stroke. Aspirin works by inhibiting the production of prostaglandins; it may irritate the lining of the stomach, causing nausea, vomiting, pain, and bleeding. High doses cause dizziness, disturbed hearing, mental confusion, and overbreathing (see SALICYLISM). Aspirin has been implicated as a cause of Reye's syndrome and should therefore not be given to children below the age of 16 years unless specifically indicated by a physician. See also ANALGESIC.

It also reduces the aggregation of blood platelets, hence its use in maintaining blood flow following heart and circulatory disorders.
