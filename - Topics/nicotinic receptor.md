- $n$. One of two types of receptors for acetylcholine found in the central nervous system and in motor neurons controlling skeletal muscles, stimulated by nicotine and inhibited by curare. Nicotinic receptors are used by the striped voluntary muscles, and slightly different types of nicotinic receptors are found at the autonomic ganglia, relaying both sympathetic and parasympathetic signals. Also called a nicotinic cholinoceptor. Compare muscarinic receptor. \[So named because nicotine mimics acetylcholine at such a site]
