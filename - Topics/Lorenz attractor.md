- Edward Lorenz first studied the equations below in 1963 while modeling weather. $$\begin{align}\frac {dx}{dt} &= \alpha(y-x) \\ \frac{dy}{dt} &= x (\beta - z)-y \\ \frac{dz}{dt}&=xy-\upgamma z\end{align}$$
- Solutions to the equations exhibit chaos. The Lorenz attractor is an example of a strange attractor, an infinite invariant set towards which nearby motions converge.
