- $n$. a phase of asexual reproduction in the life cycle of a sporozoan (protozoan parasite) that occurs in the liver or red blood cells. The parasite grows and divides many times to form a schizont, which contains many merozoites. The eventual release of merozoites of Plasmodium, the malaria parasite, from the blood cells produces fever in the patient.
