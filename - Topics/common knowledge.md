- When everyone knows a piece of information, and everyone knows that everyone knows that information, and so on without limit. The content of this definition can be appreciated by comparing it to mutual knowledge: everyone knows a piece of information but does not necessarily know if anyone else knows it. The assumption of common knowledge is frequently used in game theory.

- $n$. Any proposition (1) that every member of a specified group knows to be true, knows that every other member knows to be true, knows that every other member knows that every other member knows to be true, and so on. It is not the same as all members of the group merely knowing the proposition to be true, as shown in the muddy children problem. The concept was introduced in 1969 by the US philosopher David K(ellogg) Lewis (1941-2001) in his book Convention: A Philosophical Study (pp. 52-68).
