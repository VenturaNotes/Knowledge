Gough (1921-2014) and introduced as a commercial test in 1952. The test yields 24 scores, including measures of personal adjustment, self-confidence, self-control, lability, counselling readiness, some response styles, and 15 personality needs, such as achievement, dominance, and endurance. Gough discussed its psychometric properties in an article in the journal Psychological Reports in 1960. Also called the Gough Adjective Check List . ACL abbrev.
