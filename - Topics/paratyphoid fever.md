- an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Salmonella paratyphi $A, B$, or $C$. Bacteria are spread in the faeces of patients or carriers, and outbreaks occur as a result of poor sanitation or unhygienic food-handling. After an incubation period of 1-10 days, symptoms, including diarrhoea, mild fever, and a pink rash on the chest, appear and last for about a week. Treatment with chloramphenicol is effective. The TAB vaccine provides temporary immunity against paratyphoid A and B.
