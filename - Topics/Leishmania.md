- $n$. a genus of parasitic flagellate protozoans, several species of which cause disease in humans (see LEISHMANIASIS). The parasite assumes a different form in each of its two hosts. In humans, especially in kala-azar patients, it is a small rounded structure, with no flagellum, called a Leishman-Donovan body, which is found within the cells of the lymphatic system, spleen, and bone marrow. In the insect carrier it is long and flagellated.
