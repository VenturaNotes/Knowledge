- A document certifying that a good was produced in a given country. Such certificates are necessary in free-trade areas, where the members do not have uniform external tariffs. They are needed to confine duty-free entry to goods produced in member countries, to avoid goods from non-members being imported to the free-trade area via members with low external tariffs and re-exported to members with higher external tariffs.
