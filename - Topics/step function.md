- A step function is a linear combination of indicator functions of bounded intervals. That is a function of the form $$\varphi(x) = \sum_{k=1}^nc_k1_{I_k}(x)$$where the $I_k$ are bounded intervals. This step function can then be assigned (in a well-defined manner) the integral $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\varphi(x)\quad dx = \sum_{k=1}^{n}c_kl(I_k)$$where $l(I)$ denotes the length of the interval $I$. Consequently step functions are a natural starting point for theorems of integration.
