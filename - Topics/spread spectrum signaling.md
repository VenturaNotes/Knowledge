- A form of modulation in which the frequency of the carrier for the modulated signal is switched rapidly between a number of predetermined possible frequencies. This has several advantages over signalling using a fixed allocation of frequencies. Its use may allow a number of transmitters to share the same range of frequencies. Successive frequencies may be determined in a way known only to the transmitter and the receiver, making it very difficult for an eavesdropper to detect the resulting signal.
