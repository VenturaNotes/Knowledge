- $n$. the transparent circular part of the front of the eyeball. It refracts the light entering the eye onto the lens, which then focuses it onto the retina. The cornea contains no blood vessels and it is extremely sensitive to pain. The innermost layer (corneal endothelium) consists of a single layer of cells that cannot regenerate. $\textemdash$ corneal adj.
## Source[^2]
- A transparent layer of tissue, continuous with the sclerotic, that forms the front part of the vertebrate eye, over the iris and lens. The cornea refracts light entering the eye onto the lens, thus assisting in the focusing of images onto the retina. See also ASTIGMATISM.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The convex, transparent, five-layered fibrous membrane that forms the outer covering of the eyeball and that is responsible for about two-thirds of the refraction of light required for focusing visual images on the retina, the remaining one-third being supplied by the crystalline lens of the eye. See also eye. corneal adj. \[From Latin corneus horny, from cornu a horn]
