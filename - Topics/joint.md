- $n$. the point at which two or more bones are connected. The opposing surfaces of the two bones are lined with cartilaginous, fibrous, or soft (synovial) tissue. The three main classes of joint are diarthrosis (freely movable), amphiarthrosis (slightly movable), and synarthrosis (immovable).
## Source[^2]
- The point of contact between two (or more) bones, together with the tissues that surround it. Joints fall into three classes that differ in the degree of freedom of movement they allow: (1) immovable joints, e.g. the sutures between the bones that form the cranium; (2) slightly movable joints, e.g. the symphyses between the vertebrae of the spinal column; and (3) freely movable or synovial joints, e.g. those that occur between the limb bones. Synovial joints include the ball-and-socket joints (between the limbs and the hip and shoulder girdles), which allow movement in all directions; and the hinge joints (e.g. at the knee and elbow), which allow movement in one plane only (see illustration). A synovial joint is bound by ligaments and lined with synovial membrane.
