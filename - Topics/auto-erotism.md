- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a form of behavior characteristic of early infancy in which an instinct (3) is satisfied without recourse to an external instinctual object. The word was first used in 1898 by the English sexologist Havelock Ellis (1859-1939) in his book Studies in the Psychology of Sex (vol. 1), where he defined it as 'spontaneous sexual emotion generated in the absence of an external stimulus proceeding, directly or indirectly, from another person' (p. 110). Also called autoeroticism. See also Allo-erotism, narcissism. \[From Greek autos self + eros love or sexual desire + -ismos indicating a state or condition]
