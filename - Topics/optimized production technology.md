- (OPT) A computer-based system for planning production and the allocation of resources. In contrast to other methods that aim to use machines to their full capacity, for OPT the management of bottlenecks is the key to efficient and effective plant utilization. Maximization of throughput in areas that are not bottlenecks only increases the build-up of work in these areas, and thus locks up capital in work in progress. While an appropriate quantity of work is necessary, too much is counterproductive. See FOCUSED IMPROVEMENT; THEORY OF CONSTRAINTS.
