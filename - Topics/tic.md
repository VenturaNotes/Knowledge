- $n$. a repeated and largely involuntary movement (motor tic) or utterance (vocal tic) varying in complexity from a muscle twitch or a grunt to elaborate well-coordinated actions and repeated words or phrases. Simple tics occur in about a quarter of all children and usually disappear within a year. Tics most often become prominent when the individual is exposed to emotional stress. See also Tourette's syndrome.
