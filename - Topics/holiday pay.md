- Wages or salary paid to a worker during a period of vacation leave to which he or she is entitled. In the UK full-time workers are now legally entitled to a minimum of 28 days paid annual leave per year, including bank holidays; part-time workers have a pro-rata entitlement. The right to holiday pay was first enshrined in English law under the Holidays with Pay Act 1938. The USA has no statutory minimum-leave entitlement.
