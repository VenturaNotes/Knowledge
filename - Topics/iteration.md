```
for i in range(10):
   print(i+1)
```
- This program uses iteration
```
count = 0

while count < 3:
    answer = input ("What is 2+2?")
    count += 1
    if answer =="4":
        print("Well done")
        break
    else:
        print("That isn't right")
```
- In iteration, there are two types, count controlled and condition controlled loops
	- This one is condition controlled
```
for i in range(10):
   print("I'm a celebrity")
   print("Get me out of here")
```
- This is count controlled
