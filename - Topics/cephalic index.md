## Source[^2]
- $n$. A numerical indication of the broadness of a head, obtained by dividing its maximum breadth by its maximum length and then multiplying by 100. The cephalic index of long (dolichocephalous) heads is below 76, of medium (mesocephalous) heads is between 76 and 80, and of broad (brachycephalous) heads is above 80. Compare CRANIAL INDEX (which is a measure of narrowness).
