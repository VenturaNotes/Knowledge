- The costs or expenses incurred by an organization. They may be capital expenditure or revenue expenditure. Although expenditure is usually incurred by an outlay of money, expenditure may also arise in accounting by the acknowledgement of a liability, for example rent accrued due, which is regarded as expenditure in the period accrued although it will not be paid until a later date.
