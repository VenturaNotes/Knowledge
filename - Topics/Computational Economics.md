- Computational Economics is a field of research in which economists and computer scientists use software-based methods to solve analytical problems in order to make accurate predictions about the economy. Since economic formulas and algorithms rarely make sense in the real world, computational economics can help people understand the intricacies of systems such as the financial market. This happens when computational economics sets out to find numerical solutions to the complex problems in the many sectors of the financial market like macroeconomics. The disciplines of economics and computer science work together to build markets and platforms that are understood by non economical people. It begins with economics, which provides information regarding the outcome of certain monetary situations in a complicated way, then computer science offers simplified and easy to understand approximations.
