- (MAD) In statistics, the arithmetic mean of the deviations (all taken as positive numbers) of all the numbers in a set of numbers from their arithmetic mean. For example, the arithmetic mean of 5, 8, 9, and 10 is 8, and therefore the deviations from this mean are $3,0,1$, and 2, giving a mean deviation of 1.5. Compare STANDARD DEVIATION.
