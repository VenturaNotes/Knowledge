- $n$. any antibody that combines with its antigen to form a complex that comes out of solution and is seen as a precipitate. The antibody-antigen reaction is specific; the precipitin reaction is therefore a useful means of confirming the identity of an unknown antigen or establishing that a serum contains antibodies to a known disease. This test may be performed in watery solution or in a semisolid medium such as agar gel. See also AGGLUTINATION.

- Any antibody that combines with its specific soluble antigen to form a precipitate. The term is sometimes applied to the precipitate itself. See also AGGLUTINATION.
