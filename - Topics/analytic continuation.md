- A holomorphic function $F:V \to \mathbb{C}$ is the analytic continuation of $f:U \to \mathbb{C}$ where $\varnothing \ne U \subseteq V$ if $f$ and $F$ agree on U. if V is connected, then the analytic continuation to V is unique, but analytic continuations of two sets $V_1$ and $V_2$ may not agree on $V_1 \cap V_2$.
