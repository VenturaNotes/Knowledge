## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The analysis of an arbitrary waveform into its constituent sinusoids (of different frequencies and amplitudes). See also Fourier TRANSFORM, ORTHONORMAL BASIS.
## Source[^2]
- An expansion of a periodic function into an infinite sum of sines and cosines, each at a different frequency, also known as harmonic analysis or spectral analysis. Techniques based on Fourier analysis are applied primarily in time series econometrics. See also FREQUENCY DOMAIN ANALYSIS.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The decomposition of a time series or a periodic phenomenon such as a sound wave or the variation in luminance across a visual image into its component sinusoidal components of different frequencies and amplitudes by fitting terms of a Fourier series to it. See also Fourier series, Fourier theorem, Fourier transform, Ohm's acoustic law. \[Named after the French mathematician Baron Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier (1768-1830) who published the fundamental mathematical results underlying it in 1822]
