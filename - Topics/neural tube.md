- the embryological structure from which the brain and spinal cord develop. It is a hollow tube of ectodermal tissue formed when two edges of a groove in a plate of primitive neural tissue (neural plate) come together and fuse. Failure of normal fusion results in a number of congenital defects (see NEURAL TUBE DEFECTS).
## Source[^2]
- A hollow tube of tissue in the early embryo of vertebrates that subsequently develops into the brain and spinal cord. It forms by folding of the ectodermal neural plate and has a central canal running through it. Sometimes the folds of the neural plate fail to close properly, resulting in neural tube defects (such as spina bifida) in the fetus.
