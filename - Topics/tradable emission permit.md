- An emission permit (a licence that allows a given level of pollution) that can be traded between polluters. Allowing permits to be traded ensures that they are eventually used by those who benefit most from being allowed to pollute. This ensures efficient allocation of pollution rights and constitutes a market-based solution to the control of an externality. See also EU Emissions Trading Scheme; pollution rights.
