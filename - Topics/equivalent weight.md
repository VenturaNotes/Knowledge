## Source [^1]
- The mass of an element or compound that could combine with or displace one gram of hydrogen (or eight grams of oxygen or 35.5 grams of chlorine) in a chemical reaction. The equivalent weight represents the ‘combining power’ of the substance. For an element it is the relative atomic mass divided by the valency. For a compound it depends on the reaction considered.
