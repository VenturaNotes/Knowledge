- $n$. either of two hereditary disorders in which the blood clots very slowly, due to a deficiency of either of two coagulation factors: haemophilia A, due to deficiency of Factor VIII (antihaemophilic factor); or haemophilia B, due to deficiency of Factor IX (Christmas factor). The patient may experience prolonged bleeding following any injury or wound, and in severe cases there is spontaneous bleeding into muscles and joints. Bleeding in haemophilia may be treated by recombinant-DNA-derived Factor VIII or plasma Factor VIII concentrate. Alternatively concentrated preparations of Factor VIII or Factor IX, obtained by freezing fresh plasma, may be administered (see CRYOPRECIPITATE). Haemophilia is controlled by a sex-linked gene, which means that it is almost exclusively restricted to males: women can carry the gene - and pass it on to their sons - without being affected themselves. The genes encoding factors VIII and IX have been used in gene therapy trials for haemophilia. $\textendash$haemophiliac $n$.

## Source[^2]
- A hereditary sex-linked disease (see sex linkage) in which there is a deficiency or defect of certain clotting factors, causing the blood to clot very slowly. The most common form is haemophilia A, which involves a deficiency of Factor VIII, whereas the much rarer haemophilia B is caused by deficiency of Factor IX. There may be prolonged bleeding following injury and, in severe cases, spontaneous bleeding into the joints and muscles. The disorder is due to a defective recessive allele of the respective gene, both of which in humans are located on the X chromosome. Female carriers of a defective allele are unaffected, whereas all males who inherit a defective allele exhibit the disease. Treatment is by infusion of the deficient clotting factor, obtained either from human donated blood plasma or recombinant tissue culture.
