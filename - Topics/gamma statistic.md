- $n$. In descriptive statistics, an index of association between two variables measured on ordinal scales. If two pairs of scores are examined, they must either be concordant, in the sense that the one ranked higher than the other on the first variable is also ranked higher than the other on the second variable, or discordant. Gamma is defined as the difference between the number of concordant pairs and the number of discordant pairs divided by the total number of concordant and discordant pairs, and it ranges from 0 to 1. Also called Goodman-Kruskall gamma, and closely related to Somers' $D$ and to Kendall's tau. \[From gamma ( $\gamma$ ), the third letter of the Greek alphabet]
