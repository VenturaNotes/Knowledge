- One of the three tests of restrictions on an unknown parameter, or a vector of unknown parameters, $\theta$, based on the maximum likelihood estimation of $\theta$ (along with the likelihood ratio test and the Wald test). The null hypothesis is $H_{0}: \lambda=0$, where $\lambda$ is the vector of Lagrange multipliers of the constrained maximization problem, in which the objective function is the log-likelihood function and the constraint is the set of restrictions. In an equivalent, simpler formulation, the LM test statistic is based on the derivatives of the log-likelihood function evaluated at $\hat{\theta}^{R}$, the maximum likelihood estimator of $\theta$ obtained under restrictions. Under the null hypothesis the distribution of the LM test statistic has asymptotically chi-square distribution, with degrees of freedom equal to the number of restrictions.
