- Paying short-term debt by arranging long-term borrowing. See FUNDING OPERATIONS.
## Source[^2]
- The conversion of government debt from short-term forms, or bills, to long-term forms, or bonds. This is regarded as a form of monetary policy, since bills are more liquid than bonds, and form part of the banks' liquid reserves, whereas bonds do not. Funding tends to raise long-term interest rates, as bonds have to be sold, and lower short-term interest rates, as bills become scarcer.
