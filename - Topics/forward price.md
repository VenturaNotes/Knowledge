- The price at which commodities, securities, or currencies are to be delivered in a forward contract. The forward price and the spot price, that is the price for immediate delivery, may differ, and the same commodity may have different forward prices for delivery at different dates. Divergences between these prices are limited by the costs of storage and possibilities of intertemporal substitution.
