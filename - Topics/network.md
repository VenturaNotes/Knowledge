## Source[^4]
- The [[TCP-IP model]] is a network model which simplifies OSI into four layers

## Source[^5]
- Advantages of networks
	- They enable data to be shared between different users and devices
	- Organizations can save money on buying hardware, as hardware devices can be shared on a network

- (1) In communications, a rather loosely defined term applied to a system that consists of terminals, nodes, and interconnection media that can include lines or trunks, satellites, microwave, medium- and long-wave radio, etc. In general, a network is a collection of resources used to establish and switch communication paths between its terminals. A given network may be classified as a local area network, a metropolitan area network, or a wide area network, the differences lying as much in their style of organization as in their technology or geographical or physical size. Networks and servers have now largely replaced centralized mainframe computers in most applications. See also MESSAGE SWITCHING, NETWORK ARCHITECTURE, NETWORK DELAY, PACKET SWITCHING. 
- (2) In electronic circuitry, an interconnection of various electrical elements. A passive network contains no active (amplifying or switching) elements such as transistors; a linear network is a passive network that contains no nonlinear elements such as diodes. 
- (3) (net) In mathematics, a connected directed graph that contains no cycles. Interconnections involving objects such as telephones, logic gates, or computers could be represented using a connected but not necessarily directed graph.

- (1) A group of consumers for whom the utility derived from the consumption of certain goods or services increases as additional consumers purchase the same goods and services. Networks emerge if these particular goods or services have little or no value in isolation, but generate more value when more consumers use the same goods and services. A market characterized by such properties is called a network market in which there exist positive consumption externalities termed network externalities. A typical example of a network market is telecommunications.
- (2) A model of the interconnections within a set of consumers or firms. A network is described by a set of links that determine which consumers or firms are connected. As examples, connections can describe which consumers know each other, or which consumers are customers of a firm. Networks can be used to describe any economic or social situation in which there is a structure to the interaction of individuals. See also PRIVATE NETWORK; PUBLIC NETWORK.
