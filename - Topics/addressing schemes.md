- The wide variety of schemes developed in order to provide compact or convenient address references in cases where the absolute address is too large to be accommodated in an instruction (see INSTRUCTION FORMAT) or where it is not possible or even necessary to assign an explicit address. Augmented, indirect, implied, immediate, and relative addressing schemes provide compact references. Indexed, relative, and symbolic addressing schemes provide convenient references. In the absence of any of these addressing schemes direct addressing is used.
