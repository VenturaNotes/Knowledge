- (EV) A statistical measure of central value often used in decision making. It is the sum of the possible outcomes in quantitative terms, such as units of output or sales, weights, or volumes, multiplied by the respective probabilities of these outcomes arising. Compare EXPECTED MONETARY VALUE.
## Source[^2]
- Given the probability distribution $P(x)$ of a discrete random variable $X$, the expected value, or the (mathematical) expectation of a function $f(X)$ is defined as$$E[f(x)]=\sum P(x) f(x)$$where the sum is taken over all possible values that $X$ can take. For a continuous random variable $X$ with probability distribution function $F(x)$ the expected value of $f(X)$ is defined as$$\int f(x) d F(x)$$where the integral is taken over all possible values of $X$. The expected value of $X$ is also referred to as the mean of the distribution of $X$.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The average value associated with a decision, calculated in the same way as an expected utility but using the monetary value of the outcomes rather than their utility (1) in the calculation. See also prospect theory, risk aversion, St Petersburg paradox. EV abbrev.
