## Source[^2]
- An approach to computing in which the end user connects to a remote network of computers (the cloud) in order to run programs, store data, etc. This enables users to access large amounts of data storage and computing power from anywhere in the world without having to own and maintain these resources themselves.
## Source[^3]
- Cloud computing is the ability to access software, services, and resources through the internet. Cloud computing removes the need to have large programs installed on in-house devices. As long as there is an active internet connection, users can access cloud computing services at any time. Many are accessible remotely from other devices. Cloud computing can help users in multiple sites access the same data or work on a single project via multiple apps.
