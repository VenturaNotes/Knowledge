- Spool is an acronym for simultaneous peripheral operations online, and defines an area inside a computer's random access memory (RAM) that stores input or output data. When a computer function is initiated but cannot be run immediately, it is placed in a spool until the computer is ready to run it. This ensures that a device's central processing unit (CPU) operates efficiently, queuing computer processes in an optimal manner.
- The most common type of spool businesses use is a print spool. Since a printer often needs time to warm up before printing a document, the print spool is used to hold the document during the warm-up period. Once the printer is ready to print the document, the print spool transmits the document's data to the computer to proceed with the printing process.
