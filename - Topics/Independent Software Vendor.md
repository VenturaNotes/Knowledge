- An independent software vendor (ISV) is a person or company that creates and sells software but isn't associated with a hardware manufacturer (think physical devices such as a memory cards and computer components).
- An ISV can be compared to an independent film producer who isn't owned or controlled by a larger movie studio. Unlike hardware companies, ISVs exist to independently develop, promote, and sell software products. While hardware manufacturers typically sell software and hardware, ISVs are independent and unaffiliated with specific hardware or hardware manufacturers.
