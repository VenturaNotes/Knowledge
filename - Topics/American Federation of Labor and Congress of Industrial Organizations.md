- The main US labour federation. The name results from the amalgamation in 1955 of two associations: the AFL representing mainly craft unions, and the CIO representing mainly industrial unions. The AFL-CIO operates mostly at the political level: wage and other industrial bargaining is carried out by its member unions. It is the US equivalent of the UK's Trades Union Congress (TUC).
