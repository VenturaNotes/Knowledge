## Source[^2]
- A concurrent version system (CVS) is one of many systems responsible for managing changes to computer programs or any other collection of information. A CVS specifically manages different versions of the same software project in a specialized digital storage space. Every software module, or operating system, is always evolving. These modules are constantly a work in progress. The CVS manages the previous versions of these modules so that if there is an obstacle or mistake made while software developers are updating the system, past versions can be referred to as a helpful guide.
