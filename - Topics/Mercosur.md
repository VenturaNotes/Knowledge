- (Southern Common Market) An association of South American nations formed in 1991 with the aim of establishing a common market between member states and harmonizing their economic and social policies. The current members are Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Venezuela (suspended in 2016); Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, Guyana and Suriname are associated members. Paraguay's membership was suspended in 2012 and restored the following year. In 2004 Mercosur signed a cooperation agreement with the Andean Community (CAN), which comprises Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela. The ultimate goal is now the complete integration of the two blocs to form a continentwide association on the model of the European Union. See also Latin American Integration Association.
