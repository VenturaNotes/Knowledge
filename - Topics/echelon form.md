- Echelon is also known as triangle form
- To be in echelon form:
	- (1) All non-zero rows are above all zero rows
	- (2) Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it
	- (3) All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros
- Different from [[Reduced Row Echelon Form]] which has more steps
