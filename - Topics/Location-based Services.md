- Location-based services is an overarching term for services that depend on geographic-specific data to provide information for the user. There are four general types of location-based services: maps/navigation, tracking services, information services, and applications. These can provide target ads, recommended events nearby, Amber alerts, turn-by-turn navigation and so much more.
