- $n$. A quasi-experimental research design similar to a one-group pretest-posttest design except that instead of a single pretest and a single posttest, the data consist of a time series in the form of a sequence of baseline measurements, followed by a change in the independent variable, usually called an intervention, and then a sequence of post-intervention measurements. Compare NON-EQUIVALENT GROUPS DESIGN.
