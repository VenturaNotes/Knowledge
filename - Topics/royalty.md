- A payment made for the right to use the property of another person for gain. This is usually an intellectual property, such as a copyright (e.g. in a book) or a patent (e.g. in an invention). A royalty may also be paid to a landowner, who has granted mineral rights to someone else, on sales of minerals extracted from the land. A royalty is regarded as a wasting asset as copyrights, patents, and mines have limited lives.
