- In semiconductor manufacturing, the term "kerfless watering" describes a technique that uses lasers to cut through silicon wafers with minimal damage or contamination. The process is less expensive and more efficient than traditional methods like sawing because it doesn't require any additional material removal steps after cutting. However, this method only works on certain materials, such as gallium arsenide (GaAs), which has higher purity levels than silicon wafers made from other elements like carbon dioxide.
