## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A means of implementing logic functions, not by the normal use of electronic circuitry but by the flow of incompressible fluids (liquids) or gases through tubing containing intersections and constrictions. The logic gates so formed are useful in situations in which high electromagnetic interference prevents the use of electronic components. If the working medium is a gas, the term pneumatic logic is often used.
