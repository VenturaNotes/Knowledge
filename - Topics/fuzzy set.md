- $n$. A generalized concept of a set in which elements have continuously graded degrees of set membership ranging from 0 to 1 , rather than either not belonging (0) or belonging (1) as in conventional set theory. It was developed in 1965 by the Azerbaijani-born US engineer and systems theorist Lotfi A. Zadeh (born 1921) to reflect the fact that many natural categories, such as baldness, tallness, and beauty, have intrinsically indistinct boundaries. See also FUZZY LOGIC, GUPPY EFFECT, PROTOTYPE THEORY.
