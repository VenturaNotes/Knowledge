## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A network design where all devices connect to a single central hub or switch
- Every device communicates with each other by sending data through a central point, effectively resembling a star shape with the hub at the center
- It's considered a simple and common network structure where adding or removing devices is easily managed by connecting them to the central hub

	- [[Star topology]] in use in a network

## source[^3]
- A simple network topology with all links connecting directly to a single central node. Star networks work well when traffic consists of multiple secondary nodes communicating with a single primary node, e.g. computer terminals connected to a timesharing host.
- The main disadvantages of a star network are:
	- (a) central switch failure disrupts the entire network;
	- (b) circuit failures between the central switch and the terminals result in loss of user communication (no alternate paths);
	- (c) the cost of having every user directly connected to the central site may be very high for geographically distant (dispersed) nodes;
	- (d) total communication capacity is often limited by the speed of the central switch.
- The main advantage of a star network is that the design of the end terminals may be very simple. See also NETWORK ARCHITECTURE.
