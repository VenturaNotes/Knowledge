- items that help to improve contact between the two paddles of a manual defibrillator and the chest wall of the patient, thus reducing the transthoracic impedance and the risk of contact burns. The most common agents are defibrillation gel pads, thin pads of electrically conductive material placed between the patient's skin and the defibrillation paddles. The two pads must not touch during defibrillation or a short circuit will form between the paddles. Liquid gels can also be used, but there is a greater risk of short-circuiting as the gel can spread between the two paddles.
