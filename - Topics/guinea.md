- A former British coin, originally made from gold from Guinea. First issued in 1663, it had various values; during most of the 18th century it stood at 21 shillings. Although it was replaced in 1817 by the sovereign, it persisted, not as a coin but as a unit of 21 shillings for charging for some professional services, until decimalization (1971). Prices are still sometimes quoted in guineas in the sale of livestock or horses, especially when this is by auction.
