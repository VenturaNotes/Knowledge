- (1) A document by which a person transfers the ownership of goods to another. Commonly the goods are transferred conditionally, as security for a debt, and a conditional bill of sale is thus a mortgage of goods. The mortgagor has a right to redeem the goods on repayment of the debt and usually remains in possession of them; the mortgagor may thus obtain false credit by appearing to own them. An absolute bill of sale transfers ownership of the goods absolutely. The Bills of Sale Acts (1878; 1882) regulate the registration and form of bills of sale. 
- (2) A document recording the change of ownership when a ship is sold; it is regarded internationally as legal proof of ownership.
