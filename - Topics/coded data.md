- Data which has been translated from the form in which it is collected, or the value it took originally according to some specified rule. Responses to questionnaire data may be in the form of tick boxes, or of open responses, but to make analysis easier these will often be given numerical codes. For measurements, data may be coded to standardize data from different sources in order to facilitate comparisons or transformed, for example by taking logarithms, in order to gain greater insights into the behavior.
