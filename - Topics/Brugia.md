- n. a genus of threadlike parasitic worms (see FILARIA). B. malayi infects humans throughout southeast Asia, causing filariasis and elephantiasis (especially of the feet and legs). B. pahangi, a parasite of wild cats and domestic animals, produces an allergic condition in humans, with coughing, breathing difficulty, and an increase in the number of eosinophils in the blood. Brugia undergoes part of its development in mosquitoes of the genera Anopheles and Mansonia, which transmit the parasite from host to host.
