- A field of economics that studies market structure and the strategic behavior of firms, with the focus on imperfect competition. It analyses the factors determining which activities are coordinated within firms and which through markets; the issues connected with providing incentives within firms to overcome principal-agent problems; the relation between the structure of industries and their performance; and the public regulation of monopolies, mergers, and competition.
