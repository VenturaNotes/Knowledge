- involuntary grasping in response to anything that touches the palm of the hand. This is a normal reflex in babies that is lost in early childhood. In adults it is a sign of damage to the prefrontal lobes of the brain.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A type of reflex in which the fingers flex in a clutching motion in response to stroking of the palm of the hand. It is normal in young infants from birth to about four months of age, during which time the grip is strong enough to support the infant's own weight, but in older people it is a neurological sign of a lesion in the premotor cortex (see мотог сORTEX). Also called the Darwinian reflex or the grasping reflex.
