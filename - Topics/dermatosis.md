- $n$. any disease of skin, particularly one without inflammation. In juvenile plantar dermatosis, which affects children up to the age of 14, the skin on the front of the sole becomes red, glazed, and symmetrically cracked. This condition, which settles spontaneously after a number of years, is believed to be related to the wearing of trainers.
