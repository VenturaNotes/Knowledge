- Ultrabook is a term coined by Intel for a category of laptops that are thin, light, and have long battery life. These devices usually run the Windows operating system and are designed for professionals who need to work on the go. Before the advent of ultrabooks, most laptops were either too heavy or had poor battery life. Ultrabooks are becoming more and more popular as they offer a good balance between portability and performance. Additionally, ultrabooks usually come with several pre-installed applications that allow users to do things such as create presentations and documents.
