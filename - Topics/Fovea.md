- $n$. (in anatomy) a small depression, especially the shallow pit in the retina at the back of the eye. It contains a large number of cones and is therefore the area of greatest acuity of vision: when the eye is directed at an object, the part of the image that is focused on the fovea is the part that is most accurately registered by the brain. See also MACULA.
## Source[^2]
- (fovea centralis) (pl. foveae) A shallow depression in the retina of the eye, opposite the lens, that is present in some vertebrates. This area contains a large concentration of cones with only a thin layer of overlying nerves. It is therefore specialized for the perception of colour and sharp intense images. The clarity is enhanced when light is focused on the foveae of both retinas simultaneously. See BINOCULAR VISION.
