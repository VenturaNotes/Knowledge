- $n$. (in anatomy) a small depression, especially the shallow pit in the retina at the back of the eye. It contains a large number of cones and is therefore the area of greatest acuity of vision: when the eye is directed at an object, the part of the image that is focused on the fovea is the part that is most accurately registered by the brain. See also MACULA.
## Source[^2]
- (fovea centralis) (pl. foveae) A shallow depression in the retina of the eye, opposite the lens, that is present in some vertebrates. This area contains a large concentration of cones with only a thin layer of overlying nerves. It is therefore specialized for the perception of color and sharp intense images. The clarity is enhanced when light is focused on the foveae of both retinas simultaneously. See BINOCULAR VISION.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any small pit or depression on or in the body, especially the fovea centralis, the small pit in the center of the macula lutea of the retina, about half a millimeter in diameter, densely packed with cones but lacking rods, where the image of an object in the direct line of vision falls and where vision is sharpest. See also Arago phenomenon, Donders' law, parafovea. foveae pl. foveal adj. \[From Latin fovea a pit]
