- $n$. (in anatomy) a small depression, especially the shallow pit in the retina at the back of the eye. It contains a large number of cones and is therefore the area of greatest acuity of vision: when the eye is directed at an object, the part of the image that is focused on the fovea is the part that is most accurately registered by the brain. See also MACULA.
