- $n$. an infestation of a living organ or tissue by maggots. The flies normally breed in decaying animal and vegetable matter; myiasis therefore generally occurs only in regions of poor hygiene, and in most cases the infestations are accidental. Various genera may infect humans. Gasterophilus, Hypoderma, Dermatobia, and Cordylobia (see TUMBU FLY) affect the skin; Fannia invades the alimentary canal and the urinary system; Phormia and Wohlfahrtia can infest open wounds and ulcers; Oestrus attacks the eyes; and Cochliomyia invades the nasal passages. Treatment of external myiases involves the destruction and removal of maggots followed by the application of antibiotics to wounds and lesions.
