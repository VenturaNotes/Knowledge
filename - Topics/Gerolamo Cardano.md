- (1501-76) Italian physician and mathematician, whose Ars magna contained the first published solutions of the general cubic equation (see CUBIC POLYNOMIAL) and the general quartic equation. Even though these were due to Tartaglia and Cardano's assistant Ludovico Ferrari respectively, Cardano was an outstanding mathematician of the time in the fields of algebra and trigonometry.
