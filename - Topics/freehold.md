## Source[^2]
- Land or property in the UK held for use by the owner without obligation to any landlord. Freehold is contrasted with leasehold, where a ground landlord is entitled to ground rents and reversion of the property at the end of the lease, and may be entitled to impose restrictions on the use of the property. Freehold property is subject to public controls on its use through planning laws, and to other restrictions such as public rights of way.
