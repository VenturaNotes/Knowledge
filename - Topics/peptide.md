## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. a molecule consisting of two or more amino acids linked by bonds between the amino group $(-\mathrm{NH})$ and the carboxyl group $(-\mathrm{CO})$. This bond is known as a peptide bond. See also POLYPEPTIDE.
## Source[^2]
- Any of a group of organic compounds comprising two or more amino acids linked by peptide bonds. These bonds are formed by the reaction between adjacent carboxyl ($\textemdash$COOH) and amino $\left(-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)$ groups with the elimination of water (see illustration). Dipeptides contain two amino acids, tripeptides three, and so on. Polypeptides contain more than 20 and usually 100-300. Naturally occurring oligopeptides (of less than 20 amino acids) include the tripeptide glutathione and the pituitary hormones antidiuretic hormone and oxytocin, which are octapeptides. Peptides also result from protein breakdown, e.g. during digestion.

## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any chemical compound of two or more amino acids linked by chemical bonds between their respective amino and carboxyl groups, including a substance such as an endorphin that regulates various bodily functions and plays an important part in the experience of pain. See also POLYPEPTIDE. \[From Greek peptein to digest]
## Source[^4]
- Any of a group of organic compounds comprising two or more amino acids linked by peptide bonds. These bonds are formed by the reaction between adjacent carboxyl (-COOH) and amino (-NH2) groups with the elimination of water (see illustration). Dipeptides contain two amino acids, tripeptides three, and so on. Polypeptides contain more than ten and usually 100-300. Naturally occurring oligopeptides (of less than ten amino acids) include the tripeptide glutathione and the pituitary hormones vasopressin and oxytocin, which are octapeptides. Peptides also result from protein breakdown, e.g. during digestion.
