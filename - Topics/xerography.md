- A dry electrostatic process for making photocopies and printing computer output with a laser printer. In a plain-paper photocopier an electrostatic image is formed on a selenium-coated plate or cylinder. This is dusted with a resinous toner, which sticks selectively to the charged areas, the image so formed being transferred to a sheet of paper, on which it is fixed by heating.
