- Money wages deflated by a suitable price index. From an employee's point of view, the relevant price index is a consumer price index such as the retail price index; real wages show what workers can consume. From the employer's point of view, the relevant price is the price of the firm's output: a rise in wages relative to prices decreases profitability and discourages employment.
