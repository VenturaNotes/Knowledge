- $n$. a condition caused by injury to the head, characterized by headache, confusion, and amnesia. These symptoms may be prolonged and constitute a post-concussional syndrome. There may be no recognizable structural damage to the brain, but scans may reveal evidence of contusion (bruising) within the brain. Repeated concussion eventually causes symptoms suggesting brain damage. See also PUNCH-DRUNK SYNDROME.
