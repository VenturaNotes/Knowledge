## Source[^3]
- $n$. a condition caused by excessive secretion of growth hormone, usually by a benign tumour of the anterior pituitary gland. Overgrowth of soft tissues and bones characteristically results in large spadelike hands and feet, prominent brow ridges, broadening of the bridge of the nose, prognathism, widely spaced teeth, enlargement of the tongue, and excessive skin tags. The condition can be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease and cancer of the large bowel. Treatment is by surgical removal of the tumour (adenomectomy) and/or radiotherapy, with or without hormone therapy.
