- The accumulation of electric charge in certain crystals, such as quartz, which do not have inversion symmetry when mechanical stress is applied. Piezoelectricity was first discussed by Jacques and Pierre Curie in 1880. It occurs because of the interaction between the stress and the electronic states of the crystal. Piezoelectricity has many applications.
