- A graph that shows acceleration plotted against time for a particle moving in a straight line. Let $v(t)$ and $a(t)$ be the velocity and acceleration, respectively, of the particle at time $t$. The acceleration-time graph is the graph $y = a(t)$, where the $t$-axis is horizontal and the $y$-axis is vertical with the positive direction upwards. With the convention that any area below the horizontal axis is negative, the area under the graph between $t=t_1$ and $t=t_2$ is equal to $v(t_2)-v(t_1)$.
