- Software-defined wide area network (SD-WAN) is a virtual WAN architecture. It refers to a large computer network that is not tied to a physical location. Wide area networks have been popular and widely used for years. Their popularity has exploded as people and businesses have begun to operate remotely more often. A software-defined WAN is a WAN that uses many forms of internet and network connectivity. This includes broadband or LTE. By using these networks, the software-defined WAN creates a virtual WAN. It thus only allows for secure connections.
