- FiOS is an abbreviation for fiber-optic service, a broadband connection that uses fiber-optic cables to transfer data over the internet as fast as about 70% of the speed of light. Fiber optics transmit encoded information to a receiving device using light signals that travel through a cluster of thin optical fibers made of glass or plastic material called fiber-optic cables. The receiving device then decodes the light signal into binary digits so that it can read the data. Fiber-optic cables resist electrical interference and are not as vulnerable to severe weather conditions as traditional copper cables or satellite signals. Businesses typically use fiber optic internet to provide their employees with secure, high-speed internet access.
