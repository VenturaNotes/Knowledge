- An organized refusal on the part of a group of employees to work, in an attempt to force their employers to concede to their demands for higher pay, shorter hours, better working conditions, etc. An official strike is one that takes place on the instructions of a trade union, whereas an unofficial strike is one that takes place without union backing. A wildcat strike is called at short notice in contravention of an agreement not to strike and it does not have union backing. A sympathetic strike is one in which one union calls its members out on strike to support another union, although it is not in dispute with its own employers. A token strike is a short withdrawal of labor, e.g. for an hour or two or even for one day, to threaten employers of more serious action to come if the employees' demands are not met. In a general strike most of the trade unions in a country call out their members, virtually bringing the country to a standstill.
- Under UK law, a trade union cannot call its members out on strike unless a majority has voted for the action in a secret ballot.
