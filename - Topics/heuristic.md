- A 'rule of thumb', based on domain knowledge from a particular application, that gives guidance in the solution of a problem. Unlike algorithms, heuristics cannot have proven performance bounds owing to their open-ended dependence on specific application knowledge; an example is 'If the sky is cloudy, then carry an umbrella.' Heuristics may thus be very valuable most of the time but their results or performance cannot be guaranteed.
