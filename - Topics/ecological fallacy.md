- An erroneous interpretation of observed association between two variables at the aggregate level as an existence of such association at the individual level. High sample correlation at the aggregate level between two variables weakly correlated at the individual level, referred to as the ecological correlation, is caused by the removal of individual variation by the aggregation (the aggregation problem).

- $n$. The inference of individual characteristics from aggregate data. The difficulty that most people have in understanding the following story illustrates the fallacy. A man was attacked by a mugger while he was walking home from a football match with his young son Peter. Peter left his father lying unconscious in the street and ran into a nearby police station to report the mugging. When Peter arrived at the police station, one of the officers on duty greeted him warmly, because Peter was that police officer's son. This story sounds impossible or illogical to most people when they read it or hear it for the first time, because they tend to commit the ecological fallacy in interpreting it. In fact, there is nothing illogical about the story. See also Brunswikian, ecology (2), lens model, NOMOTHETIC, PROBABILISTIC FUNCTIONALISM.
