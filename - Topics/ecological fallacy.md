- An erroneous interpretation of observed association between two variables at the aggregate level as an existence of such association at the individual level. High sample correlation at the aggregate level between two variables weakly correlated at the individual level, referred to as the ecological correlation, is caused by the removal of individual variation by the aggregation (the aggregation problem).
