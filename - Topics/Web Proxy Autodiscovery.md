- Web Proxy Auto-Discovery (WPAD) is an internet protocol used by web browsers to automatically locate cache services within a network. This protocol ensures that all devices on a network use the same web proxy configuration. To locate an available cache service, the WPAD-enabled client uses dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP). If this proves unsuccessful, WPAD will utilize the service location protocol (SLP). If the SLP fails to locate cache services in a network then the WPAD will search through the domain name system (DNS) records to locate a cache service. Once the WPAD connects to the cache service, the cache service stores copies of popular web pages at a location closer to the user. Therefore, when a specific webpage is requested by a computer user, the browser is directed to the cache service for the web page instead of having to travel through the network to its website of origin.
