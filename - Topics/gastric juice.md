- the liquid secreted by the gastric glands of the stomach. Its main digestive constituents are hydrochloric acid, mucin, rennin, and pepsinogen. The acid acts on pepsinogen to produce pepsin, which functions best in an acid medium. The acidity of the stomach contents also kills unwanted bacteria and other organisms that have been ingested with the food. Gastric juice also contains intrinsic factor, which is necessary for the absorption of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$.
## Source[^2]
- An acidic mixture of inorganic salts, hydrochloric acid, mucus, and pepsinogens secreted by gastric glands in the stomach lining and important for digestion of food. Oxyntic (parietal) cells in the gastric glands secrete hydrogen and chloride ions, while chief cells secrete the inactive proenzyme pepsinogen. In the lumen of the stomach, the hydrochloric acid converts pepsinogen into the active enzyme pepsin, which catalyses the initial digestion of food proteins.
