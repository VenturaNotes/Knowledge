- (SCC) any cancer of squamous epithelium, arising from such tissues as the skin and the lining of the upper airways and digestive tract (especially in the head and neck). SCC is the second commonest form of skin cancer (after basal cell carcinoma), occurring usually in late-middle and old age. Cumulative sun exposure is the commonest cause but other environmental carcinogens may be responsible. Renal transplant patients are at particularly high risk of this tumour. SCC is mainly found on areas exposed to light and is three times more common in men than in women. SCC grows faster than basal cell carcinoma; it spreads locally at first but later may spread to sites distant from its origin (see METASTASIS). Treatment is usually by surgical excision or radiotherapy.
