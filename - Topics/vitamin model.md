- A model that compares the effect of certain factors on job satisfaction to the effect of vitamins on the body. Nine 'vitamins' are identified, and the employee will require a minimum level of each if he or she is to remain satisfied. Of these nine, three (money, security, and social position) can be taken in very large amounts with no ill effects. However, an excess of the other six factors (externally set goals, clarity, variety, control, use of skills, and contact with others) can be problematic.
