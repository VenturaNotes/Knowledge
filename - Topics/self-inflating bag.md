- a device for delivering emergency artificial ventilation by means of a tight-fitting face mask, a laryngeal mask, or an endotracheal tube (see intubation). It consists of a stiff plastic bag, which is squeezed to deliver its gas contents into the patient's airway; when the pressure is released, it is reinflated from the atmosphere or an attached oxygen supply. Flow into and out of the bag is controlled by a system of simple valves. With an attached oxygen supply, high concentrations of oxygen can be given.
