- A project management office exists for the sole purpose of managing ongoing projects and ensuring that projects align to company standards and practices. Some of the common PM methods used by a PMO include Agile, Waterfall, Scrum, and Six Sigma. While a PMO is responsible for directing teams throughout various projects, they also have other duties that aid in more efficient project management including choosing a team leader, conflict resolution, resource planning, and tool management.
