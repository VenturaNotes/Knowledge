- (convergence almost everywhere, convergence with probability one, strong convergence) A random variable $x_{n}$ converges to a constant $c$ almost surely if the probability of observing a sequence that does not converge to $c$ vanishes for $n$ large enough. Formally, as $n$ goes to infinity, $\lim \operatorname{Prob}\left[\left|x_{i}-c\right|>\varepsilon\right.$ for all $\left.i \geq n\right]=0$ for all $\varepsilon>0$. Almost sure convergence implies convergence in probability.
