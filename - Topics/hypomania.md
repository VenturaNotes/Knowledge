- n. a mild degree of mania. Elated mood leads to faulty judgment; behavior lacks the usual social restraints and the sexual drive is increased; there is a reduced need for sleep; speech is rapid and pressured; the individual is energetic but not persistent and tends to be irritable or possibly aggressive. The abnormality is not as great as in mania (see ELATION; EUPHORIA). Treatment follows the same principles as for mania, and it may be difficult to prevent an individual from damaging his or her own interests with extravagant behavior; hospitalization would indicate that the severity of mania had been reached. $\textemdash$hypomanic adj.
