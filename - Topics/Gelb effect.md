- $n$. The appearance of a black surface as white when it is brightly illuminated by a narrowly focused spotlight and viewed in front of a dimly illuminated background. If a white object is held in the beam of the spotlight in front of the black surface, the black surface immediately appears black, but as soon as the white object is removed it reverts to looking white. This phenomenon can be demonstrated using a slide projector or electric torch (flashlight) to produce a narrow beam of light. Together with its counterpart, the Kardos effect, it demonstrates that the lightness dimension of color is not determined straightforwardly by physical light intensity but is subject to context effects, as are other dimensions of color. See also lightness, luminance. Compare chequer-Shadow illusion, Land effect. \[Named after the Russian-born German psychologist Adh√©mar Maximillian Maurice Gelb (1887-1936) who published his discovery of it in a book chapter in 1929]
