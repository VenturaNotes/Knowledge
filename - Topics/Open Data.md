- Open data is information available for anyone to use and share. The data can be used for any purpose without restrictions, except to attribute it to its source. Content must be in a public domain and machine-readable form to qualify as open data. Copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property rights do not apply to open data. However, some organizations have licenses to explain how the data can be used. Also, open data sometimes refers to content shared outside of an organization and used for purposes other than intended.
