- Suppose that the particle $P$ is moving in the plane, in a circle with centre at the origin $O$ and radius $r_{0}$. Let $\left(r_{0}, \theta\right)$ be the polar coordinates of $P$. At an elementary level, the angular velocity may be defined to be $\dot{\theta}$, where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to time.

  

At a more advanced level, the angular velocity $\omega$ of the particle $P$ is the vector defined by $\boldsymbol{\omega}=\theta \cdot \mathbf{k}$, where $\mathbf{i}$ and $\mathbf{j}$ are unit vectors in the directions of the positive $x$ - and $y$-axes, and $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{i} \times \mathbf{j}$. If $\mathbf{r}$ and $\mathbf{v}$ are the position vector and velocity of $P$, then

  

$$

\mathbf{r}=r_{0} \mathbf{e}_{r}, \quad \mathbf{v}=\dot{\mathbf{r}}=r_{0} \dot{\theta} \mathbf{e}_{\theta}

$$

  

where $\mathbf{e}_{r}=\mathbf{i} \cos \theta+\mathbf{j} \sin \theta$ and $\mathbf{e}_{\theta}=-\mathbf{i} \sin \theta+\mathbf{j} \cos \theta$ (see CIRCULAR MOTION). By using the fact that $\mathbf{k}=\mathbf{e}_{r} \times \mathbf{e}_{\theta}$, it follows that the velocity $\mathbf{v}$ is given by $\mathbf{v}=\boldsymbol{\omega} \times \mathbf{r}$.

  

Consider a rigid body rotating about a fixed axis, and take coordinate axes so that the $z$ axis is along the fixed axis. Let $\left(r_{0}, \theta\right)$ be the polar coordinates of some point of the rigid body, not on the axis, lying in the plane $z=0$. Then the angular velocity $\omega$ of the rigid body is defined by $\boldsymbol{\omega}=\dot{\theta} \mathbf{k}$.

  

In general, for a rigid body that is rotating, such as a top spinning about a fixed point, the rigid body possesses an angular velocity $\omega$ whose magnitude and direction depend on time,

  

though the formula $\mathbf{v}=\omega \times \mathbf{r}$ still applies.
