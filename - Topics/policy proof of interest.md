- (PPI) An insurance policy (usually marine insurance) in which the insurers agree that they will not insist on the usual requirement that the insured must prove an insurable interest existed in the subject matter before a claim is paid. The possession of the policy is all that is required. These policies are a matter of trust between insurer and insured as they are not legally enforceable. They are issued for convenience in cases in which an insurable interest exists but is extremely difficult to prove or in which an insurable interest might come into existence later in the voyage.
