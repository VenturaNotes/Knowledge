- Triple Bottom Line (3BL) is a business theory coined by entrepreneur John Elkington. The 3BL theory states that instead of companies being solely focused on a monetary bottomline, they should also focus on people and the planet. Specifically, companies should strive to create a positive working environment for their employees, prioritize customer satisfaction, create trusting relationships with their business partners, and seek to have an eco-friendly impact on the planet. By focusing on their 3BL, businesses can accurately gauge their profitability, corporate ethics, and impact on the environment over their company ªs lifespan.
