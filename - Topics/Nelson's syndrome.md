- a condition in which an ACTH-producing pituitary tumor expands after loss of negative feedback following bilateral adrenalectomy for Cushing's disease. (see Cushing's SYndROME) Hyperpigmentation due to excess pituitary MSH secretion is a prominent feature. Nelson's syndrome has become rare because the standard treatment for Cushing's disease is now surgical removal of the tumor; bilateral adrenalectomy is used only in extreme circumstances. \[D. H. Nelson (1925-2009), US physician]
