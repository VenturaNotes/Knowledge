- The ability to compete in markets for goods or services. This is based on a combination of price and quality. With equal quality and an established reputation, suppliers are competitive only if their prices are as low as those of rivals. A new supplier without an established reputation may need a lower price than rivals to compete. With lower quality than rivals, a firm may not be competitive even with a low price; with a reputation for superior quality, a supplier may be competitive even with a higher price than rivals. Similar propositions apply to a country's exports.

- (1) The ability of an economy to supply increasing aggregate demand and maintain exports. A loss of competitiveness is usually signalled by increasing imports and falling exports. Competitiveness is often measured in a narrower sense by comparing relative inflation rates. For instance, if the sterling-dollar exchange rate remains constant, but prices rise faster in the UK than in the US, UK goods will become relatively more expensive, reflecting a loss in competitiveness; this in turn may lead to a falling demand for exports. 
- (2) The ability of an organization to compete successfully with its commercial rivals. See COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE; COMPETITOR ANALYSIS.
