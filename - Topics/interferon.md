- $n$. a substance that is produced by cells infected with a virus and has the ability to inhibit viral growth (see CYTOKINES). Interferon is active against many different viruses, but particular interferons are effective only in the species that produces them. There are three types of human interferon: alpha (from white blood cells), beta (from fibroblasts), and gamma (from lymphocytes).
- Human interferon can be produced in bacterial host cells by genetic engineering for clinical use. Interferon alfa is used in treating hepatitis B and C and certain lymphomas and other cancers, peginterferon alfa is used for hepatitis B and C, and interferon beta for multiple sclerosis. Sideeffects, including flulike symptoms, lethargy, and depression, may be severe.
