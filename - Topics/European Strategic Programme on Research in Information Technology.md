## Source [^1]
- There have been three ESPRIT programs: ESPRIT I, 1984-87; ESPRIT II, 1987-91; ESPRIT III, 1991-94. They were funded by the European Community, and formed major components of the Community's successive R\&D Framework Programmes (I, II, and III respectively).
- Under Framework IV (1995-98), the ESPRIT label was dropped and the program went under the name RTD Programme in Information Technologies (RTD is short for Research and Technological Development). Subsequent programs were Framework V (1998-2002) and Framework VI (2002-06), and Framework VII (2007-13). In 2013 the name was changed to Horizon, the current program being Horizon 2020 (2014-20).
