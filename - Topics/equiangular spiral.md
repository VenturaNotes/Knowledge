- A curve whose equation in polar coordinates is $r = ae^{k \theta}$, where $a > 0$ and $k$ are constants. Let $O$ be the origin and $P$ be any point on the curve. The curve derives its name from the property that the angle $\alpha$ between $OP$ and the tangent at $P$ is constant. In fact, $k = cot\alpha$. The curve is also called the logarithmic spiral.
