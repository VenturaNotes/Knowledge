- (service agreement) A contract between an employer and a director or other very senior employee. Service contracts must be kept at the registered office of a company and be open to inspection by members of the company. The Companies Act 2006 prohibits service contracts that give an employee guaranteed employment for more than five years, without the company having an opportunity to break the employment as and when it needs to. This measure prevents directors with long service agreements from suing companies for loss of office in the event of a takeover or reorganization. The 2006 Act also broadened the definition of a service contract to include a contract for services as well as a contract of employment. See also COMPENSATION FOR LOSS OF OFFICE; GOLDEN PARACHUTE.

- A contract for the provision of services. These may be routine services, such as inspection, regular maintenance, or cleaning, or emergency services such as repair after breakdowns, or provision of temporary staff to cover absence of permanent employees. Service contracts are useful where firms require services involving specialized labor, management skills, or equipment, but do not need them regularly enough to make it economic to provide them in-house.
