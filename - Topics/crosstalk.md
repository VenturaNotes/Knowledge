- A spurious signal that has been coupled from one communication channel to an adjacent channel. This interferes with (causes errors on) the second channel. Crosstalk is usually associated with physical communication channels. It is usually expressed in decibels and is frequency dependent. Crosstalk is caused by capacitive or inductive coupling or by common impedances.
