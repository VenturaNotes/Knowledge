- The management of documents throughout their life cycle from creation to death. It includes the capture of documents as digital images, typically by means of document scanners, and the storage, indexing, retrieval, processing, transmission, and printing of these documents. Optical disks are often used for archival storage. With the advances in portable computers, portable DIP is now feasible. DIP systems can also be used on networks, allowing several users to access the document files.
