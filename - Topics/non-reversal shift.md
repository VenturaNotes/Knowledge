- $n$. A form of serial learning (2) in which the set of stimuli is changed, but the rewarded and non-rewarded items are not simply interchanged, a typical example being an experiment in which organisms are trained to choose the round rather than the square containers, irrespective of their colors, and are then presented with stimulus sets in which the reward is associated with the yellow rather than the blue containers irrespective of their shapes. Compare HABIT REVERSAL.
