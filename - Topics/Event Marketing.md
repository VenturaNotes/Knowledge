- Event marketing refers to the process in which an event is marketed. The events marketed can be live, recorded, or virtual. However, the end goal of event marketing is to recruit people to watch an event and potentially participate in post-activities. This marketing may occur using real-world advertisements. It also may involve the use of in-event tools, such as polls, chatting, responses to questions, virtual breakout rooms, or more.
