- (GBS method) An extrapolation method for the solution of ordinary differential equations based on the midpoint rule. For stiff problems a similar scheme can be based on the implicit midpoint rule:

  

$$

y_{n+1}=y_{n}+h f\left(x_{n}+1 / 2 h,\left(y_{n}+y_{n+1}\right) / 2\right)

$$

  

where $h$ is the stepsize.
