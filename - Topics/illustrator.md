- $n$. Anything that elucidates or amplifies, especially by visual signs, or anyone who produces pictures to clarify or explain a written text. In social psychology, a gesture (1) that accompanies speech and that depicts, clarifies, or amplifies what is being said, as when a person locks two hands together to illustrate a phrase referring to a powerful bond between two people, or punches the fist of one hand into the palm of the other to accompany a description of a car crash.
