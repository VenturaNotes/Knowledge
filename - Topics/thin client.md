- A workstation on a network that does not have a local hard disk, but is able to download applications and data from a central server. In networked client/server systems it may be convenient to centralize data storage and software distribution. The workstations may have considerable processing power and be able to run complex software without invoking local disk access.

- In client/server computing, a thin client is a computer that runs from resources stored on a central server, not the local hard drive. The thin client connects remotely to a server-based computing environment where most applications, memory, and sensitive data are stored.
