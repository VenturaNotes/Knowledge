- (G20) A group of 19 leading economies plus the European Union. Meetings of G20 finance ministers and central bank governors have been held regularly since 1999. The first summit of G20 heads of state was held in November 2008 as a response to the global financial crisis and it was subsequently agreed that the G20 would take over from the Group of Eight as the main forum for the world's wealthy nations. Summit meetings are now held annually.
