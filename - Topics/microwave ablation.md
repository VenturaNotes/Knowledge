- (MWA) an ablation technique in which microwaves are used to burn tumor tissues. This has some advantages over radiofrequency ablation because the heat generated is field heating, as in conventional microwave machines. This makes it possible to get a bigger ablation zone and means that the ablation is not affected by the heat-sink effect of adjacent blood vessels.
