- $n$. An idea that is inborn, rather than being learned through experience. The French philosopher Ren√© Descartes (1596-1650) believed the idea of God to be innate, and the German philosopher Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz (1646-1716) believed that mathematical truisms such as 1 $+1=2$ are innate, but the British empiricist philosophers John Locke (1632-1704), George Berkeley (1685-1753), and David Hume (1711-76) rejected innate ideas in favor of the tabula rasa. The notion was revived by the Swiss psychologist Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) in his collective unconscious and, in modified form, by the US linguist and philosopher (Avram) Noam Chomsky (born 1928) in his concepts of universal grammar and the language acquisition device. See also collective unconscious, empiricism, innate, nativism, Psammetichus experiment, rationalism (1, 2). Compare empiricism. \[From Latin innatus born in, from in in or into + natus born, from nasci to be born + Greek idea a model, pattern, or form, from idein to see]
