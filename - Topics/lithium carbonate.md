- $n$. A salt of lithium, used as a mood stabilizer in the treatment of acute manic episodes and bipolar disorders in general, by replacing sodium in body tissues, thereby affecting the permeability of their membranes. It curbs both manic and depressive episodes by stabilizing levels of the neurotransmitter glutamate in the brain. It, or its close relative lithium citrate, is also used in the treatment of hypomanic episodes and (more controversially and at best indirectly) depressive disorders. Also called simply lithium. See also ANTIMANIC, MOOD STABILIZER, ORPHAN DRUG.
