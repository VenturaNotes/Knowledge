- Any computer architecture in which the underlying model of computation is different from what has come to be called the standard von Neumann model (see von Neumann machine). A non von Neumann machine may thus be without the concept of sequential flow of control (i.e. without any register corresponding to a 'program counter' that indicates the current point that has been reached in execution of a program) and/or without the concept of a variable (i.e. without 'named' storage locations in which a value may be stored and subsequently referenced or changed).
- Examples of non von Neumann machines are the dataflow machines and the reduction machines. In both of these cases there is a high degree of parallelism, and instead of variables there are immutable bindings between names and constant values.
- Note that the term non von Neumann is usually reserved for machines that represent a radical departure from the von Neumann model, and is therefore not normally applied to multiprocessor or multicomputer architectures, which effectively offer a set of cooperating von Neumann machines.
