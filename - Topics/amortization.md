- The building up over a period of a fund to replace a productive asset at the end of its useful life, or to repay a loan. In the case of a loan, the amount required for amortization depends on the interest rate that can be earned on the accumulated fund. In the case of replacement of physical assets, the amount needed depends not only on the interest rate, but also on the expected lifetime of the asset and on the rate of inflation, which affects the expected cost of replacement.

- Amortization is an accounting technique in which a debt is paid by submitting predetermined payment installments over a specified period of time. Businesses often use amortization to pay off loans or debt, but amortization can also be used to periodically lower the value of intangible assets such as intellectual property rights. Amortization helps companies quantify the gradual losses associated with their intangible assets, often referred to as amortization expenses. Corporations can then deduct their amortization expenses from their taxable business income, reducing the amount of taxes they have to pay each fiscal year.

- (1) The process of treating as an expense the annual amount deemed to waste away from a fixed asset. The concept is particularly applied to leases, which are acquired for a given sum for a specified term at the end of which the lease will have no value. It is customary to divide the cost of the lease by the number of years of its term and treat the result as an annual charge against profit. While this method does not necessarily reflect the value of the lease at any given time, it is an equitable way of allocating the original cost between periods. Compare DEPRECIATION.
- Goodwill may also be amortized. The Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (Sections 18-19) requires the writing-off of goodwill to the profit and loss account in regular instalments over the period of its economic life. 
- (2) The repayment of debt by a borrower in a series of instalments over a period. Each payment includes interest and part repayment of the capital. 
- (3) The spreading of the front-end fee charged on taking out a loan over the life of a loan, for accounting purposes. 
- (4) In the USA, another word for depreciation.
