- The building up over a period of a fund to replace a productive asset at the end of its useful life, or to repay a loan. In the case of a loan, the amount required for amortization depends on the interest rate that can be earned on the accumulated fund. In the case of replacement of physical assets, the amount needed depends not only on the interest rate, but also on the expected lifetime of the asset and on the rate of inflation, which affects the expected cost of replacement.

- Amortization is an accounting technique in which a debt is paid by submitting predetermined payment installments over a specified period of time. Businesses often use amortization to pay off loans or debt, but amortization can also be used to periodically lower the value of intangible assets such as intellectual property rights. Amortization helps companies quantify the gradual losses associated with their intangible assets, often referred to as amortization expenses. Corporations can then deduct their amortization expenses from their taxable business income, reducing the amount of taxes they have to pay each fiscal year.
