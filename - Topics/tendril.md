- A slender branched or unbranched structure found in many climbing plants. It may be a modified stem, leaf, leaflet, or petiole. Tendrils respond to contact with solid objects by twining around them (see THIGMOTROPISM). The cells that touch the object lose water and decrease in volume in comparison to the outer cells, thus causing the tendril to curve.
