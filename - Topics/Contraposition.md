## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
- It's a type of [[indirect proof]] which uses $p \implies q$ is equivalent to its [[contrapositive]] $\lnot q \implies \lnot p$

## Source[^2]
- $A \to B$ $\iff$ $\lnot B \to \lnot A$ 
	- Change order of [[Implication|conditional]] but add negation sign on both sides 
	- Logical Variables:
		- A = There is fog
		- B = We have poor visibility
	- Left Side:
		- If there is fog, then we have poor visibility
	- Right Side:
		- If we don't have poor visibility, there is no fog
