- The relationship between the management of an organization and its workforce. If industrial relations are good, the whole workforce will be well motivated to work hard for the benefit of the organization and its customers. The job satisfaction in such an environment will itself provide some of the rewards for achieving good industrial relations. If the industrial relations are bad, both management and workers will find the workplace an uncongenial environment, causing discontent, poor motivation, and a marked tendency to take self-destructive industrial action.

- The relations between the management and workforce of an enterprise, particularly bargaining through trade unions. This mainly concerns pay, hours and conditions of work, fringe benefits, security of employment, redundancy and redundancy payments, and disciplinary and grievance procedures. These can be determined by economy-wide legislation or, whenever there is scope, by bargaining at the firm or industry level, sometimes through trade unions.
