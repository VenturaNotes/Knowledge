- A stronger condition than continuous or uniformly continuous. A function $f$ on an interval $I$ (of the real line) is absolutely continuous if, for every positive number $\varepsilon$, there exists a positive number $\delta$ so that for every finite sequence of pairwise disjoint subintervals of $I$ with $\sum_{k}\left|y_{k}-x_{k}\right|<\delta$ then $\sum_{k}\left|f\left(y_{k}\right)-f\left(x_{k}\right)\right|<\varepsilon$. Functions satisfying the Lipschitz condition are absolutely continuous. Absolutely continuous functions have a derivative almost everywhere (see ALMOST ALL) which satisfies the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus. See also Cantor distribution.
