- $n$. the occurrence of one or more convulsions not caused by other conditions, such as epilepsy or cerebral haemorrhage, in a woman with pre-eclampsia. The onset of convulsions may be preceded by a sudden rise in blood pressure and/or a sudden increase in oedema and development of oliguria. The convulsions are usually followed by coma. Eclampsia is a threat to the life of both mother and baby and must be treated immediately.
