- $n$. The obscuring of one sound, sometimes called a test stimulus, by another, called a masking stimulus, causing the absolute threshold of the test stimulus to increase or its perceived loudness to decrease. The masking stimulus is presented either before the test stimulus (forward masking), at the same time as the test stimulus (simultaneous masking), or after the test stimulus (backward masking), and backward or forward masking has been found to occur when the masking stimulus is presented within 100 milliseconds of the test stimulus. See also CENTRAL MASKING, CRITICAL BAND, MASKING.
