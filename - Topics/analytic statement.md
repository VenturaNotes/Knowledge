## Source [^1]
- $n$. In logic, a declarative statement in which the predicate is contained in the subject. Such a statement cannot be confirmed or refuted by observation or experience, and its negation is either directly or implicitly self-contradictory. One example is the statement All bachelors are unmarried; another is God is omnipotent, provided that omnipotence is part of the definition of God. The truth or falsity of an analytic statement or proposition is a priori. Also called an analytic proposition. Compare synthetic statement. \[From Greek analytikos, analytic, from analyein to break down or dissolve, from ana- down + lyein to loosen]
