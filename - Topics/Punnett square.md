- A representation of all possible genotypes produced in the $\mathrm{~F}_{2}$ generation of a Mendelian genetic cross; it was devised by R. C. Punnett. All possible male gametes are listed horizontally against a grid and all possible female gametes are listed vertically against the grid. The various combinations of these gametes are then written into the grid. See illustration at dihybrid cross.
