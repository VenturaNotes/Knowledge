- cancer arising in the epithelium of the air passages (bronchial cancer) or lung (see also NON-SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER; SMALL-CELL LUNG CANCER). It is a very common form of cancer, particularly in Britain, and is strongly associated with cigarette smoking and exposure to industrial air pollutants (including asbestos). There are often no symptoms in the early stages of the disease, when diagnosis is made on X-ray examination. Treatment includes surgical removal of the affected lobe or lung (less than $20 \%$ of cases are suitable for surgery), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy.
