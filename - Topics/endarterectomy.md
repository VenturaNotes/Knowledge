- $n$. a surgical 're-bore' of an artery that has become obstructed by atheroma with or without a blood clot (thrombus); the former operation is known as thromboendarterectomy. The inner part of the wall is removed together with any clot that is present. This restores patency and arterial blood flow to the tissues beyond the obstruction. The technique is most often applied to obstruction of the carotid arteries (carotid endarterectomy) or of the arteries that supply the legs.
