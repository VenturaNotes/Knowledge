- Defective ribosomal products: peptides produced in cells by enzymic digestion of the natural waste matter of protein synthesis, such as misfolded proteins and prematurely terminated polypeptides arising from errors in the synthetic machinery. DRiPs play a role in the immune system as an important source of self antigen for presentation at the cell surface in combination with MHC class I proteins.

- DRIPs: A group of single-celled eukaryotes, also called Mesomycetozoea or Ichthyosporea, that live chiefly as parasites of fish and other aquatic animals. The acronym derives from the initial letters of the names of the four genera known to the discoverers of the group: Dermocystidium, 'Rosette agent' (now given the formal taxonomic name Sphaerothecum destruens), Ichthyophonus, and Psorospermium. The group includes several commercially important parasites and the causative agent (Rhinosporidium seeberi) of the human disease rhinosporidiosis, which affects the nose. Molecular systematics shows DRIPs to be among the closest single-celled relatives of the animals, forming a branch in the phylogenetic tree near to the divergence of fungi and animals.
