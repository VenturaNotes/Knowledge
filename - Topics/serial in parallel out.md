- A term used to describe a class of digital device that can accept serial sequential $n$-bit data streams and convert them into parallel $n$-bit data words. These devices often consist of an $n$-bit shift register that is serial loaded with $n$ bits of data from the input stream under the control of an external clock (see diagram). The $n$-bit data word can then be read in parallel form from the shift register. Compare PARALLEL IN SERIAL OUT.
