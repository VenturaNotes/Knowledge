- $n$. A person who uses mnemonics. Research has shown that most if not all professional memory performers use mnemonics. One of the most phenomenal and most thoroughly investigated of mnemonists, the Russian man usually referred to as S (actually called Shereshevskii), studied in depth by the Russian neuropsychologist Alexandr Romanovich Luria (1902-77) and described in his book The Mind of a Mnemonist (1968), relied heavily on mnemonics, including the method of loci. See also HYPERTHYMESIA. Compare HYPERMNESIA.
