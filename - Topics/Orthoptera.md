- A large order of exopterygote insects containing the grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, and$\textemdash$in some classification systems$\textemdash$the cockroaches (see DICTYOPTERA). They are characterized by enlarged hind legs modified for jumping and biting mouthparts and produce sounds by stridulation. The crickets and long-horned grasshoppers (e.g. Gryllus, Tettigonia) have long threadlike antennae and stridulate by rubbing together modified veins on their forewings. The hearing organs are on the front legs. The short-horned grasshoppers and locusts (e.g. Chorthippus, Locusta) have short antennae and stridulate by rubbing pegs on the hind leg against a hardened vein on the forewing. The hearing organs are on the abdomen.
