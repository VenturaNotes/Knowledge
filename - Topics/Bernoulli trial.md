- One of a sequence of independent experiments, each of which has an outcome considered to be success or failure, all with the same probability $p$ of success (see BERNOULLI DISTRIBUTION). The number of successes in a sequence of Bernoulli trials has a binomial distribution. The number of experiments required to achieve the first success has a geometric distribution.
