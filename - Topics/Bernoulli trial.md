- One of a sequence of independent experiments, each of which has an outcome considered to be success or failure, all with the same probability $p$ of success (see BERNOULLI DISTRIBUTION). The number of successes in a sequence of Bernoulli trials has a binomial distribution. The number of experiments required to achieve the first success has a geometric distribution.

- $n$. In the theory of probability, any of a sequence of independent random experiments each of which has two possible outcomes, often labelled success $(S)$ or failure $(F)$, with unchanging probabilities, a standard example being a sequence of coin tosses. See also binomial test. \[Named after the Swiss mathematician Jacob (or Jacques or James) Bernoulli (1654-1705) who developed it in his book Ars Conjectandi (1713)]
