- Speculation, otherwise known as speculative loading in the computer programming industry, is a technique often used to keep the instruction execution rate of a program high by making predictions based on a program ªs structure and profile. In the speculative loading process, a compiler or processor guesses the outcome of an instruction in order to remove it as a dependency for other executing instructions. This reduces bottlenecks associated with process-memory exchanges by putting all the data into memory before the actual load instruction executes.
