## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Speculation, otherwise known as speculative loading in the computer programming industry, is a technique often used to keep the instruction execution rate of a program high by making predictions based on a program ªs structure and profile. In the speculative loading process, a compiler or processor guesses the outcome of an instruction in order to remove it as a dependency for other executing instructions. This reduces bottlenecks associated with process-memory exchanges by putting all the data into memory before the actual load instruction executes.
## Source[^2]
- The purchase or sale of something for the sole purpose of making a capital gain. For professional speculators the security, commodity, and foreign exchange markets are natural venues as they cater for speculation as well as investment and trading. Indeed, speculators help to make a viable market and thus smooth out price fluctuations. This is particularly true of commodity futures and option markets.
