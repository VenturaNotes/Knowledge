## Source [^1]
- Speculation, otherwise known as speculative loading in the computer programming industry, is a technique often used to keep the instruction execution rate of a program high by making predictions based on a program ªs structure and profile. In the speculative loading process, a compiler or processor guesses the outcome of an instruction in order to remove it as a dependency for other executing instructions. This reduces bottlenecks associated with process-memory exchanges by putting all the data into memory before the actual load instruction executes.
## Source[^2]
- The purchase or sale of something for the sole purpose of making a capital gain. For professional speculators the security, commodity, and foreign exchange markets are natural venues as they cater for speculation as well as investment and trading. Indeed, speculators help to make a viable market and thus smooth out price fluctuations. This is particularly true of commodity futures and option markets.
## Source[^3]
- Economic activity aimed at profiting from expected changes in the prices of goods, assets, or currencies. In a world of uncertainty, most transactions are capable of being interpreted as speculative, but the term speculation is reserved for transactions where expected capital gains provide a major motive. Speculators may buy goods or assets they do not want but whose prices they expect to rise, or buy call options on such assets. They can contract to buy assets they do not have the funds to pay for. Speculators may sell goods, assets, or currencies they do not really want to part with, but whose prices they expect to fall, so that they will be able to buy them back more cheaply; or they may buy put options on such assets. It is also possible to contract to sell assets one does not actually possess. The introduction of new forms of financial derivative have extended the possibilities for speculation.
