- The removal of names and addresses that appear in a customer or prospect list more than once. Duplicate records often occur because data is collated from a variety of sources. Furthermore, names and addresses are not always listed in exactly the same way and details are often incomplete. Good deduplication software, usually known as de-duping software, should be able to identify and flag these anomalies.
