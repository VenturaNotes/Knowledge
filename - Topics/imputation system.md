- A corporation tax system in which a company making a qualifying distribution pays tax on the dividend paid. The shareholder receiving the dividend also receives a credit representing the tax paid by the company and this can be used to offset his or her tax liability. The UK operated an imputation system until 1999 (see ADVANCE CORPORATION TAX; FRANKED INVESTMENT INCOME).
