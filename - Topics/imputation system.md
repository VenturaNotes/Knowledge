- A corporation tax system in which a company making a qualifying distribution pays tax on the dividend paid. The shareholder receiving the dividend also receives a credit representing the tax paid by the company and this can be used to offset his or her tax liability. The UK operated an imputation system until 1999 (see ADVANCE CORPORATION TAX; FRANKED INVESTMENT INCOME).
## Source[^2]
- The system of corporation tax used in the UK from 1972 until 1999. Dividends distributed to shareholders were subject to tax, but taxes on company profits collected in advance corporation tax were treated as tax credits at basic rate for investors receiving dividends. Shareholders had the grossed-up value of their dividends treated as taxable income: if the basic rate of tax was $t$, the grossed-up value of dividends was the amount received multiplied by $1 /(1-t)$. With basic rate tax already paid, shareholders were liable only for the excess of their own marginal tax rate over basic rate, and could claim refunds if their marginal rate of tax was lower than basic rate or if they were not subject to income tax.
