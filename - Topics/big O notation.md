- Notation for comparing the relative order of functions. We write $f(x)=$ $O(g(x))$ if $f(x) / g(x)$ remains bounded as $x \rightarrow \infty$, so, for example, $(x+1)(x+2)=O\left(x^{2}\right)$. The notation is also used in the neighborhood of finite values; for example $\sin x=x+O\left(x^{3}\right)$ denotes the fact that $(\sin x-x) / x^{3}$ remains bounded (in fact converges) as $x \rightarrow 0$. See also LITTLE O NOTATION.
