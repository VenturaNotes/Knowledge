- A reduction in the availability of loans accompanied by an increase in the severity of the conditions required to be granted credit. There are several reasons why a credit crunch may occur. It may be due to tighter monetary policy that reduces liquidity in the banking system or the direct imposition of credit control. Alternatively, banks may expect future losses on existing loans and so ration credit to avoid further exposure, or suffer a loss of confidence in the solvency of the banking system. A credit crunch followed the 2008 financial crisis.
## Source[^2]
- A period during which lenders are unwilling to extend credit to borrowers or the costs of borrowing rise. The term is particularly associated with the period beginning in late 2007, when the previous era of 'easy credit' came to a sudden end in the wake of the subprime lending fiasco. See also CREDIT SQUEEZE.
