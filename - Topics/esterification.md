## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A condensation reaction of an alcohol with an acid to produce an ester and water; e.g.$$\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OH}+\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{COOH} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{OOCC}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}$$The reaction is an equilibrium and is slow under normal conditions, but can be speeded up by addition of a strong acid catalyst.
