- A class of vertebrates comprising the fishes with cartilaginous skeletons. The majority belong to the subclass Elasmobranchii (skates, rays, and sharks$\textemdash$see SELACHII). Most cartilaginous fishes are marine carnivores with powerful jaws. Unlike bony fishes, they have no swim bladder, and therefore avoid sinking only by constant swimming with the aid of an asymmetrical (heterocercal) tail. There is no operculum covering the gill slits, the first of which is modified as a spiracle. Fertilization is internal so the few eggs produced are consequently yolky, large, and well-protected. Some cartilaginous fishes show viviparous development of the young (see viviparity).
