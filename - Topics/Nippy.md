- trade name for a brand of noninvasive positive-pressure ventilator that delivers air through a close-fitting nasal mask (see NONINVASIVE VENTILATION). The Nippy was one of the early ventilators from the late 1980s and early 1990s, initially used in intensive care units. Although many others are now in use, the name is often used as a generic term for devices used on general wards for ventilatory support for patients with acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
