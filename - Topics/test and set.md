- A single indivisible instruction that is capable of testing the value of the contents of a register and altering them. The instruction is used to implement more powerful indivisible operations (such as lock, unlock, or semaphore operations) when the process executing the operation is capable of being interrupted and where the servicing of the interrupt may cause another process to be restarted.
