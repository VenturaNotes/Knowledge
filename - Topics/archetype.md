- (1) A perfect or typical example of its class, or another name for a prototype (2). 
- (2) In analytical psychology, an inherited mental structure or pattern, forming part of the collective unconscious, observable only through its manifestations in behavior, especially that associated with ancient and universal experiences such as birth, marriage, motherhood, and death. Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) introduced the term into his technical vocabulary in 1919 and later defined it as 'an irrepresentable, unconscious, pre-existent form that seems to be part of the inherited structure of the psyche and can therefore manifest itself spontaneously anywhere, at any time' (Collected Works, 10, paragraph 847). Also (originally) called a primordial image. See also aniMA, ANIMUS (3), ARCHETYPAL FORM, COLLECTIVE unCONSCIOUS, IMAGO (1), PRIMORDIAL IMAGE, PUER aETERNUS, SHADOW (2). archetypal adj. \[From Greek archetypon an original, from arche the beginning + typos a model]
