- A loan made to a customer with a cheque account at a bank or building society, in which the account is allowed to go into debit, usually up to a specified limit (the overdraft limit). Interest is charged on the daily debit balance. This is a less costly way of borrowing than taking a bank loan (providing the interest rates are the same) as, with an overdraft, credits are taken into account.

- A negative balance in a bank account, so that the customer owes the bank money. This is often allowed only by prior arrangement, though customers with a good credit record may be allowed to overdraw without prior arrangement. Overdrafts are allowed only up to a set limit, and incur interest and possibly extra service charges for the customer.
