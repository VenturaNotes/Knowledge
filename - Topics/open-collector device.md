## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A particular implementation of an electronic logic device in which the output of the device is formed by the open-circuit collector termination of the output transistor (see diagram). The device's output is thus active-low and a pull-up resistor is required to establish the active-high state. These devices are used to drive loads with high supply voltages or to implement wired logic buses.
