- a hearing test in which a vibrating tuning fork is placed at the midpoint of the forehead. A normal individual hears it equally in both ears, but if one ear is affected by conductive deafness the sound appears louder in the affected ear. If one ear has a sensorineural deafness the sound appears louder in the unaffected ear. \[F. E. Weber (1832-91), German otologist]
