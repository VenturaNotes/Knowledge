- $n$. A structure that is present in certain cells of the central nervous system and that comprises three interacting neuroreceptors, the first being a receptor that is stimulated by sedative or hypnotic drugs such as barbiturates and is inhibited by convulsant drugs; the second a receptor that is stimulated by benzodiazepines; and the third the primary GABA receptor, stimulation of which inhibits neuronal activity by enlarging chloride channels, this effect being augmented by the presence of either barbiturates or benzodiazepines and blocked by convulsants.
