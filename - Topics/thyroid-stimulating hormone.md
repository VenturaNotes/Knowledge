- (TSH, thyrotrophin) a hormone, synthesized and secreted by the anterior pituitary gland under the control of thyrotrophin-releasing hormone, that stimulates activity of the thyroid gland. Raised levels of TSH are found in primary hypothyroidism. Normal or low TSH levels in the presence of a low serum thyroxine are found in secondary hypothyroidism and the euthyroid sick syndrome.
## Source[^2]
- (TSH; thyrotrophin; thyrotropin) A hormone, secreted by the anterior pituitary gland, that controls the synthesis and secretion of the two thyroid hormones, thyroxine and triiodothyronine, in the thyroid gland. The secretion of thyroidstimulating hormone is controlled by thyrotrophin-releasing hormone (TRH) from the hypothalamus. The release of TRH depends on many factors, including the levels of TSH, glucose, and thyroxine in the blood and the rate of metabolism in the body.
