- Advocacy marketing refers to marketing that is done by your most loyal and dedicated customers. This means that a business or brand goes out of its way to encourage and incentivize having its customers market for them. This can be done in a variety of ways, including simply asking customers to make positive posts, or giving them rewards—like free products—for doing so. Social media posts are one of the most common forms of advocacy marketing. Advocacy marketing holds many advantages above traditional marketing. One of the biggest benefits is that it seems more genuine than paid ads.
