- That part of consumption which does not depend on current income. If aggregate consumption, $C$, is given by $C=a+$ $b Y_{d}$, where $Y_{d}$ is disposable income, $a$ can be regarded as autonomous consumption. $a>0$ because even those with no income need to consume to live, and can finance expenditure by running down assets or borrowing. The level of $a$ is influenced by total assets held, expectations of future income or acquisitions of assets through legacies, and social conventions about minimal acceptable standards of living.
