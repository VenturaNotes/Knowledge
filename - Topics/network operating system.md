## Source[^2]
- A network operating system (NOS) is the software or tool used to create a user interface for a local area network (LAN). A LAN connects devices together in a network without the need to connect to the internet. The NOS becomes the central hub for these devices. Without a NOS, LANs may not have the functionality of a true network. Some operating systems (such as Linux, for example) offer free services to set up a NOS. Others may offer apps and services to make a NOS more user-friendly or easier to set up.
