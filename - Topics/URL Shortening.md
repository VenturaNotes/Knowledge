- URL shortening is a technique used to abbreviate lengthy URLs into shorter ones. When clicked, the shortened URL redirects end users back to the original site URL. URL shortening is a common practice among website owners because long URLs are often difficult to remember and time-consuming to type into a web browserâ€™s address bar. Most URL shortening services allow users to customize their short URLs and track the web traffic they receive.
