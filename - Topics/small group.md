- A group that meets two out of three of the following criteria for the current and preceding year, or the two preceding financial years:
	- its net worth should not exceed $£ 3.26$ million net or $£ 3.9$ million gross;
	- its turnover should not exceed $£ 6.5$ million net or $£ 7.8$ million gross;
	- the average number of employees should not exceed 50.
- If a group is in its first financial year, it may still qualify if it falls within these limits.
- Under the Companies Act, a parent company is not required to prepare group accounts for a financial year in which the group headed by that parent qualifies as a small group. A small group may file abbreviated accounts instead of full accounts with the Registrar of Companies.
- A group containing a public company, a banking or insurance company, or an authorized person under the Financial Services Act 1986 is ineligible for the exemptions for small groups. Compare MEDIUM-SIZED GROUP.
