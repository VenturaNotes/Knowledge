- $n$. (pl. neuroses) any long-term mental or behavioral disorder in which contact with reality is retained and the condition is recognized by the sufferer as abnormal: the term and concept originated from Freud. A neurosis essentially features anxiety or behavior exaggeratedly designed to avoid anxiety. Defence mechanisms against anxiety take various forms and may appear as phobias, obsessions, compulsions, or sexual dysfunctions. In recent classifications, the disorders formerly included under the neuroses have been renamed. The general term is now anxiety disorder; hysteria has become conversion disorder; amnesia, fugue, and depersonalization are dissociative disorders; obsessional neurosis is now known as obsessive-compulsive disorder; and depressive neurosis has become dysthymia. Psychoanalysis has proved of little value in curing these conditions; behavior therapy and SSRIs are effective in many cases. $\textendash$neurotic adj.
