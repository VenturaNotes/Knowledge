- narrowing of the opening of the mitral valve: a result of chronic scarring that follows rheumatic fever. It may be seen alone or combined with mitral regurgitation. The symptoms are similar to those of mitral regurgitation except that the patient has a diastolic murmur. Mild cases need no treatment, but severe cases are treated by reopening the stenosis with an Inoue balloon passed to the heart through the venous system under X-ray control (percutaneous balloon mitral valvuloplasty) or surgically by inserting an artificial valve (mitral prosthesis).
