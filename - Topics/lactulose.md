- $n$. a disaccharide sugar that acts as a gentle but effective osmotic laxative. It is administered by mouth but is not absorbed or broken down, remaining intact until it reaches the colon. There it is split by bacteria into simpler sugars that help to retain water, thereby softening the stools. Lactulose is also used as a bowel cleanser for treating hepatic encephalopathy.
