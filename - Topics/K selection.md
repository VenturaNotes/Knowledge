- A type of selection that favors organisms with a low rate of reproduction but whose populations expand to the maximum number of individuals that the habitat can support (the carrying capacity of the habitat). K-selected species (or $\boldsymbol{K}$ strategists) tend to be highly adapted to their environment and are able to compete successfully for food and other resources. They also tend to inhabit stable environments and have relatively long life spans. See SURVIVAL CURVE. Compare R SELECTION.
