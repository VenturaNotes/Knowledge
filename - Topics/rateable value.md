- The value placed on buildings in the UK for purposes of local taxation. Rateable values were originally supposed to be estimates of the rent which would be paid on a property, but over time have come to bear little relation to this. Rateable values are still used for the business rate and as a basis for domestic water rates, but have been replaced by the council tax as the tax on residential property.
