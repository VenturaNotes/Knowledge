- Any dismissal of an employee that the employer cannot show to be fair. Under the Employment Rights Act 1996 employees have the right not to be unfairly dismissed, provided they have served the required period of continuous employment (52 weeks for full-time employment). Dismissal for membership or non-membership of a trade union is always regarded as unfair dismissal, whatever the employee's length of service. Employees who consider that they have been unfairly dismissed can apply within three months after the effective date of termination of their employment contract to an employment tribunal for reinstatement, reengagement, or compensation. The tribunal will make an award unless the employer shows that the principal reason for the dismissal was the employee's incapability, lack of qualifications, or conduct; redundancy; the fact that it would be illegal to continue employing the person; or some other substantial reason. The employer must also show that he acted reasonably in dismissing the employee. Compare WRONGFUL DISMISSAL.
