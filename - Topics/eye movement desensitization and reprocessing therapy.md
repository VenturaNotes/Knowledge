## Synthesis
- It helps people process traumatic memories and distressing life experiences by recalling them while simultaneously engaging in bilateral stimulation (like eye movements, tapping, or sounds) to reduce the memory's emotional impact, allowing the brain to reprocess it adaptively, which alleviates symptoms of PTSD, anxiety, and depression
	- #question By engaging, do we mean the focus is moved towards someone else making these movements or we make these movements ourselves? 
- It works by facilitating the brain's natural healing process, helping to "unstick" traumatic memories so they are stored with less distress and replaced with positive beliefs, rather than being re-experienced as flashbacks or nightmares.
	- #question What is the brain's natural healing process?
	- #question Does this mean during EMDR, you need to recall traumatic memories while positively reframing these memories and engage in bilateral stimulation at the same time?
