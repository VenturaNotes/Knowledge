- $n$. In the study of problem solving, any problem in which either the starting position, the allowable operations, or the goal state is not clearly specified, or a unique solution cannot be shown to exist. A typical example is the problem of overpopulation, which satisfies none of these criteria. Also called an ill-structured problem. Compare WELL-DEFINED PROBLEM.
