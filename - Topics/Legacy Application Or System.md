- A legacy system (or legacy application) is an information system that uses outdated technologies and processes. A team in an organization might still rely on this system to facilitate day-to-day tasks but can't fulfill its objectives because of technological limitations. For example, SMBs might use an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that doesn't interact with updated analytics tools. As a result, decision-makers can't generate valuable data insights about business processes. A legacy system can provide teams with various challenges:
	- The system might put data security at risk.
	- It might be expensive to operate because managers have to continuously fix issues with the system.
	- It might be difficult for employees to use.
	- It isn't compatible with newer software.
