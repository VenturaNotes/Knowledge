- $n$. slowing of the heart rate to less than 50 beats per minute. Sinus bradycardia is often found in healthy individuals, especially athletes, but it is also seen in some patients with reduced thyroid activity, jaundice, hypothermia, or vasovagal attacks. Bradycardia may also result from arrhythmias, especially complete heart block, when the slowing is often extreme and often causes loss of consciousness.
