Host computers range in size from small microcomputers to large time-sharing or batch mainframes. Many networks have a hierarchical structure, with a communication subnetwork providing packet switching services for host computers to support timesharing, remote job entry, etc. A host computer at one level of a hierarchy may function as a packet or message switch at another.
