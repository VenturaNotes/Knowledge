- A theorem about a logical system $L$ and a semantics $S$ for the formulas of $L$ stating that if a formula is provable in the logic $L$ then it is valid in the semantics $S$. A soundness theorem confirms that the logic is actually expressing and deriving properties that are valid according to the semantics. See also COMPLETENESS THEOREM.
