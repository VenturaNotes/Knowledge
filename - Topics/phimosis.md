- $n$. narrowing of the opening of the foreskin, which cannot therefore be drawn back over the underlying glans penis. Physiological phimosis is present at birth and is due to congenital adhesions between the foreskin and glans. Nearly all cases resolve by puberty. Pathological phimosis is usually caused by BXO (see BALANITIS) and can predispose to inflammation (see also BALANOPOSTHITIS), which results in further narrowing. Treatment is by surgical removal of the foreskin (circumcision).
