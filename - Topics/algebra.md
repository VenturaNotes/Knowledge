- 1. The investigation of mathematical properties of data, such as numbers, and of operations on data, such as the addition and multiplication of numbers. 2. A collection of sets together with a collection of operations over those sets. Many examples involve only one set, such as the following:

(a) the set $N=\{0,1,2, \ldots\}$ of natural numbers together with, for example, the operations of addition, subtraction, and multiplication;

(b) the set $B=\{$ TRUE, FALSE $\}$ of Boolean truth values together with the operations AND, OR, and NOT (see also BOOLEAN ALGEBRA);

(c) the set of all finite strings over a set of symbols together with the operation of concatenation;

(d) a set of sets together with the operations of union, intersection, and complement (see also SET ALGEBRA).

  

In computer science, however, it is natural to consider algebras involving more than one set. These are called many-sorted algebras, in contrast to single-sorted algebras with only one set. For example, in programming languages there are different data types such as Boolean, integer, real, character, etc., as well as user-defined types. Operations on elements of these types can then be seen as giving rise to a many-sorted algebra. By stating axioms that define properties of these operations, an abstract data type can be specified. See also ALGEBRAIC STRUCTURE, SIGNATURE.

### Definition 1
- Elementary algebra relates to the general properties of arithmetic and solutions of polynomial equations involving unknown variables. More advanced algebra focuses on algebraic structures that are usually generalizations or abstractions of more concrete problems. The use of algebra, to some extent, permeates all of mathematics, and algebraic techniques have become important in other areas such as algebraic topology. The word algebra derives from a work al-jabr of Khwārizmī. Viète made significant advances in the use of algebraic notation in the 16th century. See also ABSTRACT ALGEBRA and LINEAR ALGEBRA.
### Definition 2
- A vector space equipped with a bilinear product. An example is the space of $n \times$ $n$ real matrices, with product $(A, B) \mapsto A B$. As here, the product need not be commutative. See also BANACH ALGEBRA, DIVISION ALGEBRA, GROUP ALGEBRA.
