## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A procedure that involves recording all data and interactions that pass through a particular point in a system. The point chosen is usually part of a communication loop or a data path to or from a device such as a keyboard and display on which data is transitory. If a system failure or an unexpected result occurs it is possible to reconstruct the situation that existed. Such logs are not generally archived and can be overwritten once the associated job has been completed. See also DATA CAPTURE.
