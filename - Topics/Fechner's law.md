- $n$. In psychophysics, the proposition that the magnitude of a sensation is proportional to the logarithm of the intensity of the stimulus causing it, usually expressed by the equation $\psi=k \log \varphi$, where $\psi$ is the magnitude of the sensation, $\varphi$ is the physical intensity of the stimulus, and $k$ is a constant scaling factor that varies from one kind of sensation to another. It has been largely supplanted by a power law, which Fechner's law approximates for many sensory modalities. Also called the Weber-Fechner law, Fechner himself having called it Weber's law. See also PSYchophysical function. \[Named after the German philosopher, physician, psychologist, and mystic Gustav Theodor Fechner (1801-87) to whom it came as a revelation as he lay in bed on 22 October 1850 contemplating the mind-body problem, although its influence was felt mainly after the publication of his Elemente der Psychophysik in 1860]
