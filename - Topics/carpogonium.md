- (pl. carpogonia) The female gametangium of the red algae (see RHODOPHYTA). Carpogonia, which are found at the tips of the female gametophyte, are flaskshaped structures from which protrudes a slender elongation called a trichogyne. The nonmotile male spermatia, released from the antheridia, attach to the trichogyne during sexual reproduction. After fertilization the carpogonium develops into the cystocarp, which contains the carpospores.
