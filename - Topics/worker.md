- Under UK employment law 'worker' is a wider category than employee, as it encompasses those who work regularly for another party but have not been given a contract of employment. This means that they are free to accept or decline work as they choose and the other party has no obligation to provide work. At the same time, such a worker is to be distinguished from a genuinely self-employed person because he or she is economically dependent on the employer, who cannot be considered a client or customer of the worker. Some employment legislation extends to all workers (e.g. the minimum wage) while some covers only employees (e.g. unfair dismissal). See also AGENCY WORKER; TEMPORARY EMPLOYEE.
