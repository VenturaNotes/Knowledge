- sharpness of vision: the degree to which a person is able to distinguish and resolve fine detail. The essential requirements are a healthy retina and the ability of the eye to focus incoming light to form a sharp image on the retina. Acuity of distant vision is often expressed as a Snellen score (see Snellen Chart) or a LogMAR score (see LogMAR Chart); acuity of near vision as a Jaeger score (see JAEGER TEST TYPES).
