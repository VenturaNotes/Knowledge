- A device for helping people with hearing difficulties. An assistive listening device can be a stand-alone device or can work in conjunction with a hearing aid or cochlear implant. Assistive listening devices include induction loop systems, amplifiers for telephones, and radio headphones to wear when listening to the radio or television. Such devices increase the loudness of the desired sound without increasing the level of any background noise; i.e. they improve the signal-to-noise ratio. See also ENVIRONMENTAL HEARING AID.
