- A function is analytic if it can be defined by a convergent Taylor Series in a neighborhood of any point of the domain. An analytic function necessarily has derivatives of all orders, but the converse is not true. The real function, defined by $f(x) = exp(-1/x^2)$ for $x \ne 0$ and $f(0) = 0$, is infinitely differentiable at $x = 0$, with all derivatives being 0; thus, the Taylor series at $x = 0$ only converges to the function at 0. The space of analytic functions is denoted $C^{\omega}$.
