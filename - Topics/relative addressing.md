- Usually either of two ways to expand a short specified address. The first is self-relative addressing where the specified address is added to the address of the instruction (generally the current contents of the program counter) that contains the self-relative reference to produce a direct address. The second is [[base addressing]] in which the specified address is added to the contents of a [[base register]] containing a base address to produce a direct address. See also ADDRESSING SCHEMES.
