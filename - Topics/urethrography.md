- $n$. a technique for X-ray examination of the urethra. Contrast medium is introduced into the urethra so that its outline and any narrowing or other abnormalities may be observed in X-ray images (urethrograms). In ascending (or antegrade) urethrography contrast medium is injected up the urethra using a special syringe and penile clamp. In descending urethrography (or micturating cystourethrography, MCU), X-rays of the urethra can be taken during the passing of watersoluble contrast material previously instilled into the bladder in order to demonstrate abnormal urethral narrowing or disorders of micturition, particularly bladder emptying.
