- Processing of sequences of data in a uniform manner, a common occurrence in manipulation of matrices (whose elements are vectors) or other arrays of data. A vector processor will process sequences of input data as a result of obeying a single vector instruction and generate a result data sequence. This orderly progression of data can capitalize on the use of pipeline processing. See also ARRAY PROCESSOR.
