- $n$. absence of vital functions. Death is diagnosed by permanent cessation of the heartbeat. Brain death is defined as permanent functional death of the centres in the brainstem that control breathing, heart rate, and other vital reflexes (including pupillary responses). Many decisions in medicine depend on death being clearly defined and objectively observed. Particular problems arise when a potential organ donor is being kept artificially alive. Legally, two independent medical opinions are required before brain death is agreed and organs can be removed for transplantation. In medical ethics, death is of crucial interest because it elucidates debates about personhood and prompts consideration of the duties owed to the living and the deceased. Religious perspectives on death may inform the ways in which people perceive the withdrawal of medical treatment and organ donation. See DYING.

- The point at which the processes that maintain an organism alive no longer function. In humans it is diagnosed by permanent cessation of the heartbeat; however, the heart can continue beating after a large part of the brain ceases to function (see BRAIN DEATH). The death of a cell due to external damage or the action of toxic substances is known as necrosis. This must be distinguished from programmed cell death (see APOPTOSIS), which is a normal part of the developmental process and the immune response.
