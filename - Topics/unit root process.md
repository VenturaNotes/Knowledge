- In time series, a non-stationary process whose first difference is stationary, also referred to as an integrated of order one or $I(1)$-process. An example of a unit root process is a random walk. The name 'unit root' is related to the roots of the polynomial equation derived from the lag polynomial representation of an autoregressive process: $A(L) y_{t}=\varepsilon_{t}$. The process $y_{t}$ is stationary if all roots of equation $A(z)=0$ are greater than 1 in absolute value, and is non-stationary if at least one root is less than or equal to 1 in absolute value; the latter is called a unit root. More generally, a process that has $n$ unit roots is integrated of order $n$.
