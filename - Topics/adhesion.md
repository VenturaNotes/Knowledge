- $n$. 
- (1) a fibrous band of connective tissue that develops in response to inflammation, trauma, or surgery, resulting in the union of two adjacent structures. Adhesions between loops of intestine often occur following abdominal surgery and may predispose to symptoms of abdominal pain or intestinal obstruction. If the pericardial sac is affected by an adhesion, the contractions of the heart may be restricted. 
- (2) a healing process in which the edges of a wound fit together. In primary adhesion there is very little granulation tissue; in secondary adhesion the two edges are joined together by granulation tissue.
