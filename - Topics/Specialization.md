## Source [^1]
- In terms of [[division of labor]], specialization allows workers to focus on parts of the production process where they have an advantage which allows for greater production than a worker trying to produce the entire good or service by themselves. 
	- #comment This actually seems to relate to [[system design]]. Having one server is typically never optimal due to potentially high traffic. 

## Source[^2]
- Specialization only makes sense if workers can use their pay to purchase other goods and services they need. Meaning, specialization requires [[trade]]
