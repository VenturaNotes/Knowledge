## Source[^2]
- $n$. A progressive, degenerative neurological disorder affecting 2 per cent of people over 65 in the developed world, associated with malfunction (usually resulting from damage caused by free radicals but occasionally due to a genetic mutation) of neurons that produce dopamine in the substantia nigra and the extended projections into the striatum, which in turn relays signals to the higher motor centres of the brain. The disease is characterized by parkinsonism, often occurring first in one hand, where it resembles pill-rolling movements of the thumb and forefinger, masklike facial expression, shuffling gait or festination, cogwheel rigidity of muscles and difficulty rising from a sitting position, shrinkage of handwriting, bradykinesia or akinesia, drooling, profuse sweating, lability of affect, and defective judgement. Also called paralysis agitans. See also AMANTADINE, ANTIPARKINSONIAN, FOETAL BRAIN TRANSPLANTATION, L-DOPA, MPP${ }^{+}$, PROGRESSIVE SUPRANUCLEAR PALSY. PD abbrev. \[Named after the English surgeon James Parkinson (1755-1824) who first described it in 1817 and called it the shaking palsy]
