- The proportional change in the quantity of money demanded divided by the proportional change in interest rate. This is a measure of the responsiveness of the demand for money to changes in interest rates. A minus sign is typically inserted into the definition to make the elasticity a positive number. The elasticity, $\varepsilon$, is given by$$\varepsilon=-\left(\frac{d M}{M}\right) /\left(\frac{d i}{i}\right)=-\left(\frac{i}{M}\right)\left(\frac{d M}{d i}\right)$$where $M$ is the demand for money and $i$ is the interest rate.
