- Investigation of the degree to which the behaviour of a system is affected by a change in the value of some (explicit or implicit) parameter or variable, or by a combination of changes. For example, a simple analysis might determine how the performance of a system is impacted by changing the number and sizes of the storage buffers that are allocated to that system.
