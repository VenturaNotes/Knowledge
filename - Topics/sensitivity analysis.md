## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Investigation of the degree to which the behavior of a system is affected by a change in the value of some (explicit or implicit) parameter or variable, or by a combination of changes. For example, a simple analysis might determine how the performance of a system is impacted by changing the number and sizes of the storage buffers that are allocated to that system.

- The varying of parameters in a simulation to discover which parameters have the greatest influence on the features of interest. 
## Source[^3]
- A method of analyzing the sensitivity of a decision to a change in one or more of the assumptions used in making it. For instance, a company might analyze how its future performance might be affected by changing its level of advertising or by lowering the price of a product, to enable it to estimate the likely impact on sales and profitability. Similarly, in considering an investment decision, it could investigate the impact of changing assumptions regarding the life of an asset, the cost of borrowing, and the end value of the asset. Apart from suggesting a range of possible outcomes, a sensitivity analysis will indicate the degree of risk associated with a decision or course of action.
