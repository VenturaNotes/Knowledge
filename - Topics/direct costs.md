- (1) Product costs that can be directly traced to a product or cost unit. They are usually made up of direct materials costs (which can be charged directly to the product by means of materials requisitions), direct labor costs (charged by means of time sheets, time cards, or computer direct data entries), and direct expenses (which are subcontract costs charged by means of an invoice from the subcontractor). The total of direct materials, direct labor, and direct expenses is known as the prime cost or direct cost of sales. 
- (2) Departmental or cost center overhead costs that can be traced directly to the appropriate parts of an organization, without the necessity of cost allocation. For example, the costs of a maintenance section that serves only one particular cost center should be charged directly to that cost center. Compare INDIRECT COSTS.
