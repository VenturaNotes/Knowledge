- (2) A floating-rate note in which the coupon is paid monthly but the interest rate paid is that applicable to a note of longer maturity. 
- (3) The situation in which the assets (loans made) and liabilities (deposits taken) of a bank are not matched, typically because the bank borrows short-term and lends long-term. This is usually acceptable as long as deposits keep coming in. See ASSET-LIABILITY MANAGEMENT; GAP.

- Differences between the skills and location of unemployed workers and available job vacancies. These help to explain why unemployment exists at the same time as unsatisfied demand for labour. Mismatch may occur because the location and skill patterns of new entrants to the labour market, those finishing education and immigrants, do not match the pattern of those leaving the labour market through retirement or emigration. It is increased by rapid changes in the pattern of demand for labour through changes in tastes or technology. Methods by which mismatch can be reduced include retraining, regulation of migration, industrial relocation, and changes in the relative wages of different occupations.
