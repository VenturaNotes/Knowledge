- Zero trust network access (ZTNA) allows restricted access to an application remotely. The service creates a "boundary" around the application and its data. This boundary hides the application, allowing only those with access priveleges to find it. Those with access use a ZTNA provider, also called a trust broker. The broker grants access to the application if it can verify the person's identity and the context of the access request. This highly secure process makes ZTNA one of the safest ways to protect an application from others.
