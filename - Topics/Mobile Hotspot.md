- A mobile hotspot is a dedicated device or function on a smartphone or tablet that allows users to cast a wireless signal for other devices while on-the-go. Mobile hotspots operate using LTE connection from a mobile device and convert it into a Wi-Fi signal that can be used by other devices, such as laptops. Wireless carriers that offer mobile hotspot devices typically require a wireless data plan to enable hotspot functionality.
