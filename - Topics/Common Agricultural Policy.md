- The European Union (EU) policy towards agriculture. This includes a price support scheme which has led to excess production. As the supported prices are generally above world market levels, there is also an external tariff, and export subsidies are used to enable surplus products to be exported. Various grants to farmers are also available. The CAP absorbs up to two-thirds of total EU expenditure, raises the cost of living for EU consumers, damages non-EU farmers, and created great difficulties in reaching agreement in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. A political agreement on the reform of the CAP was achieved in 2013; the reforms are to be implemented in 2014-20.

- (CAP) A policy set up by the European Economic Community to support free trade within the Common Market and to protect farmers in the member states. The European Commission fixes a threshold price, below which cereals may not be imported into the European Union (EU), and also buys surplus cereals at an agreed intervention price in order to help farmers achieve a reasonable average price, called the target price. Prices are also agreed for meats, poultry, eggs, fruit, and vegetables, with arrangements similar to those for cereals. The European Commission is also empowered by the CAP to subsidize the modernization of farms within the community. The common policy for exporting agricultural products to non-member countries is laid down by the CAP. In the UK, the Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce is responsible for the implementation of EU regulations regarding the CAP. Important reforms designed mainly to eliminate surpluses and to uphold environmental and production standards were agreed in 1984, 1988, 1999, 2003, and 2014.
