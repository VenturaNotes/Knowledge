- The European Union (EU) policy towards agriculture. This includes a price support scheme which has led to excess production. As the supported prices are generally above world market levels, there is also an external tariff, and export subsidies are used to enable surplus products to be exported. Various grants to farmers are also available. The CAP absorbs up to two-thirds of total EU expenditure, raises the cost of living for EU consumers, damages non-EU farmers, and created great difficulties in reaching agreement in the Uruguay Round of world trade talks. A political agreement on the reform of the CAP was achieved in 2013; the reforms are to be implemented in 2014-20.
