- The removal of a substance from solution by its association with a precipitate of some other substance. For example, if A and B are present in solution and a reagent is added such that A forms an insoluble precipitate, then B may be carried down with the precipitate of A, even though it is soluble under the conditions. This can occur by occlusion or absorption.
