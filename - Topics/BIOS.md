## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Basic Input/Output System. Software that is stored in non-volatile memory, that carries out checks on core system components and starts up (boots) a computer system to the point where management and control can be passed to the operating system.

## Source[^2]
- Firmware permanently resident in microcomputer systems that executes as the first stage of a cold boot. It verifies and initializes the various hardware components, then loads and runs software that loads the operating system. Formerly, in such operating systems as CP/M and MS-DOS, the BIOS was also responsible for most input and output operations; modern operating systems use device drivers for this purpose.
