## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- Basic Input/Output System. Software that is stored in non-volatile memory, that carries out checks on core system components and starts up (boots) a computer system to the point where management and control can be passed to the operating system.

## Source[^2]
- Firmware permanently resident in microcomputer systems that executes as the first stage of a cold boot. It verifies and initializes the various hardware components, then loads and runs software that loads the operating system. Formerly, in such operating systems as CP/M and MS-DOS, the BIOS was also responsible for most input and output operations; modern operating systems use device drivers for this purpose.
## Source[^3]
- A basic input/output system (BIOS) is software stored on a computer's motherboard that is used by the computer's microprocessor to start the computer system after it is powered on. The BIOS links specific hardware devices to software and instructs the computer on how to perform basic functions such as keyboard control. The BIOS identifies and configures the computer's hardware, such as the hard drive, CPU, optical drive, memory, and attached devices. All modern computer motherboards have BIOS software. Because the BIOS is part of the motherboard hardware, access and configuration on computer systems are independent of any operating system.
