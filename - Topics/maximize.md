- In a graphical user interface, to cause a window to expand to its maximum size, usually filling the entire screen. The action is achieved by clicking on the maximize button or selecting 'maximize' from a window control menu. The maximum size and the behavior of items within the window (i.e. do they get enlarged too or is more seen of them?) are determined by the window definition.
