- $n$. a form of non-carious tooth-tissue loss manifesting as notching at the neck of a tooth. It is thought that this is caused by the forces placed on the teeth during biting, chewing, and grinding, resulting in flexion and the separation of the enamel from the dentine at the cemento-enamel junction.
