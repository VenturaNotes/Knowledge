- $n$. A superordinate factor (2) of personality suggested by the Slovenian psychologist Janek Musek (born 1945) in an article in the Journal of Research in Personality in 1977. It incorporates the Big Five personality factors as lower-order factors, and a person who scores highly on this factor is consequently extraverted, agreeable, conscientious, emotionally stable (rather than neurotic), and open to experience or intelligent. Also called the Big One. See also alpha PERSONALITY FACTOR, BETA PERSONALITY FACTOR. GFP abbrev.
