- $n$. A grammar, first suggested by the Singaporean-born US psychologist Martin D. S. Braine (1926-96) in an article in the journal Language in 1963, based on two grammatical classes of words, namely pivot $(P)$ and open $(O)$, to describe two-word utterances of children at an early stage of language development, from about 18 months to 2 years of age. The $P$ words are taken from a small vocabulary of high-frequency words that seldom occur as single-word utterances, and the $O$ words from large, open classes of nouns, verbs, and adjectives. Typical $P+O$ constructions recorded by Braine and later researchers are Pretty fan, Night-night boat, and Allgone ball. Compare HOLOPHRASE, TELEGRAPHIC SPEECH.
