- $n$. a fluid that circulates throughout the body, via the arteries and veins, providing a vehicle by which an immense variety of different substances are transported between the various organs and tissues. It is composed of blood cells, which are suspended in a liquid medium, the plasma. An average individual has approximately 70 ml of blood per kilogram body weight (about 5 litres in an average adult male). See Appendix 2.
## Source[^2]
- A fluid body tissue that acts as a transport and homeostatic medium within an animal. It is contained within a blood vascular system and in vertebrates is circulated by means of contractions of the heart. Oxygen and nutrients are carried to tissues, and carbon dioxide and chemical (nitrogenous) waste are transported from tissues to excretory organs for disposal (excretion). In addition blood carries hormones, acts as a defence system, and is important in maintaining a suitable osmotic and pH environment for tissues. Blood consists of a liquid (see BLOOD PLASMA) containing blood cells (see ERYTHROCYTE; LEUCOCYTE) and platelets.
