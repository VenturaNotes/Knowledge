- $n$. a fluid that circulates throughout the body, via the arteries and veins, providing a vehicle by which an immense variety of different substances are transported between the various organs and tissues. It is composed of blood cells, which are suspended in a liquid medium, the plasma. An average individual has approximately 70 ml of blood per kilogram body weight (about 5 litres in an average adult male). See Appendix 2.
## Source[^2]
- A fluid body tissue that acts as a transport and homeostatic medium within an animal. It is contained within a blood vascular system and in vertebrates is circulated by means of contractions of the heart. Oxygen and nutrients are carried to tissues, and carbon dioxide and chemical (nitrogenous) waste are transported from tissues to excretory organs for disposal (excretion). In addition blood carries hormones, acts as a defence system, and is important in maintaining a suitable osmotic and pH environment for tissues. Blood consists of a liquid (see BLOOD PLASMA) containing blood cells (see ERYTHROCYTE; LEUCOCYTE) and platelets.

## Source[^3]
- $n$. The fluid that is pumped through the arteries and veins by the heart to supply the tissues of the body with nutrients and oxygen, to remove waste products, and to transport hormones and other substances. In vertebrates it is red and is composed of a pale yellow fluid called plasma (1) in which are suspended erythrocytes, leucocytes, and platelets. See also BLOOD-BRAIN BARRIER, BLOOD GROUP, ERYTHROPOIETIN, HUMOR (3).
