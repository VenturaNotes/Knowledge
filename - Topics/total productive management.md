- (TPM) An approach to management that empowers the employees operating a piece of equipment to take responsibility for a wide range of routine maintenance tasks, traditionally carried out by a separate engineering function, and to develop a proactive approach to the prevention of failure. Integral to total quality management, TPM is an essential part of just-in-time techniques. The overall objective is to optimize the effectiveness of plant by eliminating downtime, less-than-maximum speed of throughput, and process-generated defects.
