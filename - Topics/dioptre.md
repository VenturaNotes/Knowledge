- $n$. the unit of measurement of the power of refraction of a lens. One dioptre is the power of a lens that brings parallel light rays to a focus at a point one metre from the lens, after passing through it. A stronger lens brings light rays to a focus at a point closer to it than a weaker lens and has a higher dioptric power.

- $n$. A unit of measurement for the refractive power of a lens, being the reciprocal of the lens's focal length in metres. US diopter. \[From Greek dioptron a spyglass from dia through + opsesthai to see]
