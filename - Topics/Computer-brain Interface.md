- Computer-brain interface is a concept that is still in the development phase of its lifecycle. Essentially, it is a technology that allows a human brain to connect and communicate with external devices. This is done by tapping into the brain signals of the person using the device and then analyzing and processing them to enable the device to create the desired results without the need for physical or voice-powered interaction. There are both invasive and non-invasive products in development. An invasive computer-brain interface would require surgical insertion of a device into the brain while non-invasive options typically include the use of exterior sensors.
