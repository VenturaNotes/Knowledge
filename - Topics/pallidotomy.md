- (pallidectomy) n. a neurosurgical operation to destroy or modify the effects of the globus pallidus (see BASAL GANGLIA), formerly used for the relief of parkinsonism and other conditions in which involuntary movements are prominent before the advent of modern drug therapies. The development of more accurate techniques to localize the globus pallidus has led to a revival in its use: in the modern form of pallidotomy, a lesion is made in the globus pallidus by stereotactic surgery (see STEREOTAXY). New techniques achieving better results involve the implantation of stimulators (pallidal stimulation).
