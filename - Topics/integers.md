## Synthesis
- The sum of two integers is always an integer
### Integer Axioms
- In [[number theory]], there are several important axioms or properties that apply to integers.
- Below are key integer axioms

#### (1) Closure Axiom for Addition:
- The sum of two integers is always an integer
- $$\forall a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, a + b \in \mathbb{Z}$$

#### (2) Closure Axiom for Multiplication
- The product of any two integers is always an integer
- $$\forall a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, a \times b \in \mathbb{Z}$$
#### (3) Commutative Axiom for Addition
- The order of addition does not change the result
- $$\forall a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, a + b = b + a$$
#### (4) Commutative Axiom for Multiplication
- The order of multiplication does not change the result
- $$\forall a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, a \times b = b \times a$$
#### (5) Associative Axiom for Addition
- The grouping of numbers in addition does not affect the result.
- $$\forall a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}, (a + b) + c = a + (b + c)$$
#### (6) Associative Axiom for Multiplication
- The groupings of numbers in multiplication does not affect the result
- $$\forall a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}, (a * b) * c = a * (b * c)$$
#### (7) Identity Axiom for Addition
- There is an identity element for addition (the number 0), such that adding 0 to any integer leaves it unchanged
- $$\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}, a + 0 = a$$
#### (8) Identity Axiom for Multiplication
- There is an identity element for multiplication (the number 1), such that multiplying any integer by 1 leaves it unchanged
- $$\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}, a \times 1 = a$$
#### (9) Inverse Axiom for Addition
- Every integer has an [[additive inverse]] (its negative), such that adding the number and its negative gives 0.
- $$\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}, a + (-a) = 0$$
#### (10) Distributive Axiom
- Whether something is an axiom or a deduction simply depends on what you're doing. If you are doing [[ring theory]], the distributive property is an axiom.
- Multiplication distributes over addition
	- #question What kind of operation or structure does the distributive axiom not apply to?
- $$\forall a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}, a \times (b + c) = a \times b + a \times c$$
#### (11) Total Order Property
- Every integer can be compared to another integer using one of the following relations: 
	- less than, equal to, or greater than
	- $$\forall a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, \text{either } a < b, a = b, \text{or } a > b$$
