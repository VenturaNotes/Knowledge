- An M4A file, also referred to as an unprotected AAC audio file, is an MPEG-4 audio file, that is encoded using lossy advanced audio coding (AAC). The M4A format was first introduced by Apple to differentiate MPEG-4 audio files from MP4 files. The M4A file type has a smaller file size than its predecessor the MP3 file. Unlike MP3 files, M4A files are only capable of storing audio, such as audiobooks, music, and podcasts. Since M4A files do not natively support Digital Rights Management (DRM) protection, they are considered an unprotected audio file. This allows computer users to edit and stream a wide variety of M4A audio files without limitations. The M4A file format is the standard file format for music on the Apple iTunes store, although it is often unsupported by non-Apple devices.
