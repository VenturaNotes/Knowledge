- A distorting effect caused by sampling an image at too low a rate. When a signal is undersampled, high-frequency components cannot be distinguished from lowerfrequency components. Thus the higher frequencies assume the alias (or false identity) of the lower frequencies. Some common computer-graphics artefacts due to aliasing are jagged lines, small objects missing from a scene, and jerky motion. Aliasing effects can be removed or subdued by anti-aliasing. Fine detail, such as mesh curtains, can be totally lost or distorted without anti-aliasing. Aliasing effects are even more prominent in animated images.
