- A distorting effect caused by sampling an image at too low a rate. When a signal is undersampled, high-frequency components cannot be distinguished from lowerfrequency components. Thus the higher frequencies assume the alias (or false identity) of the lower frequencies. Some common computer-graphics artefacts due to aliasing are jagged lines, small objects missing from a scene, and jerky motion. Aliasing effects can be removed or subdued by anti-aliasing. Fine detail, such as mesh curtains, can be totally lost or distorted without anti-aliasing. Aliasing effects are even more prominent in animated images.

- $n$. In a visual or auditory signal or any periodic or oscillating variable or time series, a distortion resulting from insufficiently high resolution when the variable is sampled at a frequency that is too low in relation to the signal's frequency, a familiar cinematographic example being the wagon wheel illusion in which the wheels of a stagecoach appear to turn slowly one way, then slowly the other way as it gathers speed. A sine wave of 1,000 hertz would appear stationary if it were sampled exactly once per millisecond (thousandth of a second) or once every two milliseconds, and so on, and it would appear to be cycling very slowly if sampled at a frequency very close to once per millisecond. See also stroboscope. \[Coined by the US statistician John Wilder Tukey (1915-2000) from Latin alias at another time, from alius other]
