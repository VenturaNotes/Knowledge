- An electronic logic gate whose output is logic 0 (false) only when all (two or more) inputs are logic 0, otherwise it is logic 1 (true). It therefore implements the logical OR operation and has the same truth table. The diagram shows the usual circuit symbol and the truth table for a two-input gate. The device is more correctly called an inclusiveOR gate since the condition of both inputs true generates a true output. See also EXCLUSIVE-OR GATE.
