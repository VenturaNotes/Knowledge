- The establishment of a long-term relationship between a bank and its customers. The main advantage is that it enables the bank to develop in-depth knowledge of a customer's business, which improves its ability to make informed decisions regarding loans to the customer. The customer expects to benefit by increased support during difficult times. See also BILATERAL BANK FACILITY; SYNDICATED BANK FACILITY.

- Banking on the basis that there is a continuing relation between a bank and a customer. The bank is expected to take an interest in the customer's business, offering advice and support when the customer is in difficulty. This can be contrasted with the view that a bank should simply operate a customer's account, and that the customer should take each type of transaction to whatever bank will handle it most cheaply.
