- The American Medical Informatics Association, or AMIA, is a not-for-profit organization that promotes the professional use of biomedical and health informatics. The organization encourages effective management and information analysis to further public health goals such as teaching, research, and patient care. Based in Maryland, AMIA provides resources about computer usage in hospitals, rehabilitation centers, public health agencies, and other healthcare facilities. These resources cover data storage, data retrieval, and data governance frameworks such as HIPAA. AMIA is also known for its peer-reviewed journal that features research about biomedical and health informatics. AMIA started in 1989 after three organizations merged: Symposium on Computer Applications in Medical Care, the American Association for Medical Systems and Informatics, and the American College of Medical Informatics.
