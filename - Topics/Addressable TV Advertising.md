- Addressable TV advertising is a form of technology that allows advertisements to be customized to better target a particular demographic. This means that advertisers can create several specific campaigns to display based on the audience during the streaming or live programs. For instance, during a sporting event, they could display an ad for beverages to one targeted market and an ad for clothing to another. With addressable TV advertising, marketers can concentrate on one highly specific subset of viewers rather than try to appeal to all of them at the same time.
