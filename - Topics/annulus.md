- (annuli) The region between two concentric circles. If the circles have radii $r$ and $r+w$, the area of the annulus is equal to $\pi (r + w)^2 - \pi r^2$, which equals $w \times 2 \pi (r + \frac 12 w)$. It is therefore the same as the area of a rectangle of width $w$ and length equal to the circumference of the circle midway in size between the two original circles.
