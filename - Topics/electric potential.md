- Symbol $V$. The energy required to bring unit electric charge from infinity to the point in an electric field at which the potential is being specified. The unit of electric potential is the volt. The potential difference (p.d.) between two points in an electric field or circuit is the difference in the values of the electric potentials at the two points, i.e. it is the work done in moving unit charge from one point to the other.
