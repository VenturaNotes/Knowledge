- a group of symptoms that represent a partial disintegration of the patient's recognition of his or her body image. It consists of an inability to name the individual fingers, misidentification of the right and left sides of the body, and inability to write or make mathematical calculations (see ACALCULIA; AGRAPHIA). It is caused by disease in the association area of the dominant (usually left) parietal lobe of the brain. \[J. G. Gerstmann (1887-1969), Austrian neurologist]
