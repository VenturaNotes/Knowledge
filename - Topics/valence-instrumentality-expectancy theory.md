- (VIE theory) A theory of motivation stating that the level of effort individuals will exert in any task can be computed from three variables: expectancy, or the belief that action or effort will lead to a successful outcome; instrumentality, or the belief that success will bring rewards; and valence, or the desirability of the rewards on offer. The theory, which was proposed by Victor H. Vroom in 1964, inspired the path-goal leadership model.
