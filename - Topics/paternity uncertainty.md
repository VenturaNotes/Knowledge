- $n$. A principle in evolutionary psychology according to which, throughout the animal kingdom, a mother always knows when a child is hers, but a father is never certain that another male did not fertilize the female's egg and that the child is not his and therefore does not carry his genes. Whenever a male spends time and effort raising offspring, there is a possibility that he is wasting energy from an evolutionary point of view, because he may be helping to transmit another male's genes, rather than his own, to the next generation. Consequently, parental investment has more certain payoffs for mothers than for fathers, and the tendency for greater female investment in care of offspring may be a result of natural selection. \[From Latin paternitas paternity, from pater father]
