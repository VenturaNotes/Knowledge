- Continuous data protection (CDP) refers to a specific method of data backup and recovery. With CDP, data is continuously backed up on a regular basis. At the same time, changes to any data are recorded. This enables systems to be restored in the event of a security breach or hardware failure. The journaling of data also functions as a security measure, as malicious programming or data changes can be detected and removed.
