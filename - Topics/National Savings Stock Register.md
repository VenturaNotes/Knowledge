- A facility that enables members of the public to buy certain Treasury stocks and other gilt-edged securities without going through a stockbroker; it is now administered by the Bank of England and provides an alternative to the main Bank of England Stock Register. Purchases and sales are made by post and the interest paid is taxable, but is paid before deduction of tax. The lower rates of commission make this the cheapest way of buying gilts. However, because transactions are carried out by post, it does not provide the maximum flexibility in a moving market.
