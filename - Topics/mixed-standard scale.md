- A measure used in evaluating the job performance of employees. An example of good, average, and poor behavior is identified for each of the key elements of a job; supervisors are then asked to rate the performance of the employee in terms of whether it is better than, equal to, or worse than each of the identified behaviors. A total score is derived from these responses. Compare BEHAVIORALLY ANCHORED RATING SCALES; BEHAVIORAL OBSERVATION SCALE.
