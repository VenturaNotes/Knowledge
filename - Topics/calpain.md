## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. A protein that is activated by calcium ions found in some synapses and that has been hypothesized to erode the membranes of postsynaptic neurons, allowing pre-existing dendritic spines to emerge, or bringing hidden receptors to the surface of dendritic spines, thus strengthening certain synaptic connections and providing a physical substrate for long-term potentiation and memory consolidation without requiring any new neural growth, which does not normally occur in the central nervous system. It is synthesized from papain, a proteolytic enzyme present in papaya latex, and is used as a protein digestant and meat tenderizer. \[From cal(cium) + (pa)pain]
