- The genetic sequence database of the US National Institutes of Health. Started in 1982, it now contains over 2 billion annotated sequence entries and over 5 billion whole genome shotgun (WGS) sequences. It can be searched in various ways, for example using the Entrez Nucleotide browser or the BLAST algorithm. GenBank, which is part of the International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration, exchanges information with sequence databases maintained by the DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ) and the European Nucleotide Archive, which is funded by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL).
