- Infonomics describes the discipline of how to manage and value information assets. This includes intellectual property, customer data, and product information. Information assets have value beyond just what they cost to create or acquire; they also have an intrinsic value based on their potential ROI. As more businesses begin to understand the importance of their information assets, they can make better decisions about protecting them.
