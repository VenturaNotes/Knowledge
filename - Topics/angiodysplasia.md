- $n$. an abnormal collection of small blood vessels found in the mucosa of the gastrointestinal tract, which are thought to be due to degeneration of previously healthy blood vessels. Angiodysplasia may be isolated lesions or found in clusters; they are located predominately in the caecum or ascending colon and they may bleed or contribute to irondeficiency anaemia. Angiodysplasia may be diagnosed at endoscopy or angiography. Treatment includes endoscopic coagulation with diathermy, argon plasma coagulation, embolization at angiography, or surgical resection in cases not responding to other treatments.
