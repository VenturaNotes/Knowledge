- A mathematical theory of decision-making by participants with conflicting interests in a competitive situation, originated by Emile Borel in 1921 and rigorously established by John von Neumann in 1928. The theory attempts to gain insights into economic situations by isolating these aspects, which occur in their simplest form in games of strategy.
- In a two-player game, as defined by the theory, each participant has a choice of plays for which there are several possible outcomes, gains or losses, depending on the opponent's choice. An optimum strategy states the relative frequency with which a player's choices should be used, so as to maximize his average gain (or minimize his average loss). The problem of determining the optimum strategy can be formulated as a problem in linear programming. Generalizations to $n$-person games are included in the theory.

- A branch of mathematics that predicts the outcomes of interactions between ‘players’ according to the costs and benefits of the strategy each player employs. Although originally developed to elucidate problems in economics, game theory is used in evolutionary biology to study behavioral strategies among animal populations, such as confrontation, cooperation, and altruism, and how these evolve. Organisms expend energy (a ‘cost’) to acquire resources (a ‘benefit’) from their surroundings. The net gain or loss of such an interaction is the payoff, and different strategies result in different payoffs. Game theory enables mathematical modelling of such interactions to predict outcomes and how the different strategies might affect reproductive fitness of individuals in the population and through subsequent generations.
