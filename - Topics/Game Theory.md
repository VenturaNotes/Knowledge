- A mathematical theory of decision-making by participants with conflicting interests in a competitive situation, originated by Emile Borel in 1921 and rigorously established by John von Neumann in 1928. The theory attempts to gain insights into economic situations by isolating these aspects, which occur in their simplest form in games of strategy.
- In a two-player game, as defined by the theory, each participant has a choice of plays for which there are several possible outcomes, gains or losses, depending on the opponent's choice. An optimum strategy states the relative frequency with which a player's choices should be used, so as to maximize his average gain (or minimize his average loss). The problem of determining the optimum strategy can be formulated as a problem in linear programming. Generalizations to $n$-person games are included in the theory.

- A branch of mathematics that predicts the outcomes of interactions between ‘players’ according to the costs and benefits of the strategy each player employs. Although originally developed to elucidate problems in economics, game theory is used in evolutionary biology to study behavioral strategies among animal populations, such as confrontation, cooperation, and altruism, and how these evolve. Organisms expend energy (a ‘cost’) to acquire resources (a ‘benefit’) from their surroundings. The net gain or loss of such an interaction is the payoff, and different strategies result in different payoffs. Game theory enables mathematical modelling of such interactions to predict outcomes and how the different strategies might affect reproductive fitness of individuals in the population and through subsequent generations.

- A mathematical theory, developed by J. von Neumann (1903-57) and O. Morgenstern (1902-77) in 1944, concerned with predicting the outcome of games of strategy (rather than games of chance) in which the participants have incomplete information about the others' intentions. Under perfect competition there is no scope for game theory, as individual actions are assumed not to influence others significantly; under oligopoly, however, this is not the case. Game theory has been increasingly applied to economics and the theory of industrial organizations. The theory was further elucidated by the economists John Nash, John Harsanyi, and Reinhard Selten (1930-2016), who received the Nobel Prize for Economics in 1994.

- The analysis of strategic situations in which the actions of one agent affect the pay-off received by another. This leads to strategic interaction in decision-making. Game theory provides a means of formally modelling strategic interaction. The key elements of the modelling are the objectives, strategies, and information of each agent, and a concept of equilibrium for the game. Useful distinctions can be made between one-off games and repeated games, where reputation established through earlier rounds of the game affects the conduct of subsequent ones; and between zero-sum games, where the game affects only the distribution of a given total of resources, positive-sum games, where some players can gain more than others lose, and negative-sum games, such as fighting over resources, where the interaction itself can decrease the amount available to be shared. Game theory is one of the key tools of economic analysis.
