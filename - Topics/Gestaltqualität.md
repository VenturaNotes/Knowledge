- $n$. A term coined by the German philosopher Christian von Ehrenfels (1859-1932) and later introduced into Gestalt psychology to denote a perceptual attribute or quality that emerges from the way in which the elements of an object or image are put together and is not reducible to the sum of those elements, his standard example being melodic constancy, according to which a tune is recognizably the same when played in a different key without using any of its original elements (tones). Also called founded content. See Gestalt. Gestaltqualitäten pl. \[From German Gestalt shape or form, from stellen to shape + Qualität quality]
