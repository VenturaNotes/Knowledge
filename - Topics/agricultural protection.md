- The use of tariffs and trade controls on agricultural products to raise their prices in a country and thus to increase its farmers' incomes. This may be desired to slow down the tendency for the share of agriculture in total income and employment to decrease. It may also aim at increasing self-sufficiency in foodstuffs and agricultural raw materials in the interests of national security. Agriculture is protected in most industrial countries, particularly in the European Union, Japan, and the US. Agricultural protection in advanced countries hinders economic growth in less developed countries, most of which are net exporters of agricultural products.
