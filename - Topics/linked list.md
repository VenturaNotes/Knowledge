- aka chained list
- A list representation in which items are not necessarily sequential in storage. Access is made possible by the use in every item of a link that contains the address of the next item in the list. The last item in the list has a special [[null link]] to indicate that there are no more items in the list. See also DOUBLY LINKED LIST, SINGLY LINKED LIST.
