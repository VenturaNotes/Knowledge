- a common disease of the skin, mainly affecting children. Characterized by papules less than 5 mm in diameter, each with a central depression, the disease is caused by a poxvirus and is spread by direct contact. Untreated, the papules generally disappear in 6-9 months. Widespread molluscum contagiosum in an adult may be a sign of HIV infection.
