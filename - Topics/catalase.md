## Source [^1]
- $n$. an enzyme, present in many cells (including red blood cells and liver cells), that catalyses the breakdown of hydrogen peroxide.
## Source[^2]
- An enzyme, found in peroxisomes, that catalyses the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, which results from oxidation reactions in the cell (see also sUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE), into water and oxygen. High concentrations of catalase are found in the liver. Catalase is one of the fastest known enzymes; it is employed in the rubber industry to break down hydrogen peroxide to form oxygen, thereby converting latex to foam rubber.
