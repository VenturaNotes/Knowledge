- Marketing performance management (MPM) is technologies and services that allow marketing teams to analyze data, make predictions, identify trends, and optimize marketing programs and campaigns. At the very least, MPM consists of a data repository, analytical software, and business intelligence (BI) tools. However, MPM can also involve role-based access to information and key performance indicators (KPIs) through dashboards, modeling, simulation, visualization, and other techniques.
