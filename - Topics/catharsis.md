## Source[^2]
- $n$. A word used by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC) to denote the purging of emotions that results from watching a staged performance of a tragedy. The key passage is as follows: 'A tragedy, then, is the imitation of an action that is serious and also, as having magnitude, complete in itself; in language with pleasurable accessories, each kind brought in separately in the parts of the work; in a dramatic, not in a narrative form; with incidents arousing pity and fear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions' (Poetics, Chapter 6, Bekker edition, p. 1449b). Aristotle may well have returned to this topic in the lost Book 2 of this work. In psychoanalysis, catharsis is the bringing to consciousness of repressed ideas, accompanied by the expression of emotions, thereby relieving tension. The Austrian physician Josef Breuer (1842-1925) first investigated it in the context of therapy in his case of Anna O, after which he and Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) imported the concept into psychoanalysis in 1895 in Studies on Hysteria (Standard Edition, II, pp. 21-47), and it became a therapeutic technique designed to produce abreaction. It was at first closely associated with hypnosis, but Freud soon began to use free association as a basic therapeutic procedure instead of hypnosis, and as a consequence catharsis receded into the background. The term has been used loosely in psychology to denote the supposed reduction of aggressive urges resulting from exposure to violence enacted in television programmes, films, or computer games. cathartic adj. \[From Greek katharsis purgation, from kathairein to purge or purify]
