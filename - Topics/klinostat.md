- A device used in experiments to test the influence of gravity on the growth movements of plants ( see GEOTROPISM). It consists of a motor that slowly rotates a drum inside which seedlings are attached. This prevents any single part of the seedlings from receiving uninterrupted gravitational stimulation and results in horizontal growth of the seedlings.
