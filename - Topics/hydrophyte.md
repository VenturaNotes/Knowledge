- Any plant that lives either in very wet soil or completely or partially submerged in water. Structural modifications of hydrophytes include the reduction of mechanical and supporting tissues and vascular tissue, the absence or reduction of a root system, and specialized leaves that may be either floating or finely divided, with little or no cuticle. Examples of hydrophytes are waterlilies and certain pondweeds. Compare HALOPHYTE; MESOPHYTE; XEROPHYTE.
