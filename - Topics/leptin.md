## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a protein that is produced and secreted by adipose tissue (especially white fat) and has a role in the regulation of eating (leptin receptors are concentrated in the hypothalamus). Increased amounts of adipose tissue result in higher concentrations of leptin and a reduction in appetite. A deficiency of leptin is responsible for a few cases of obesity.
## Source[^2]
- A protein hormone, comprising 167 amino acids in humans, that is secreted by adipose tissue; it suppresses appetite and regulates adipose tissue mass and energy balance. It acts on leptin receptors in the hypothalamus and inhibits expression of neuropeptide Y, thereby countering the appetite-stimulating effects of ghrelin and inhibiting food intake. It also promotes synthesis of the appetite suppressant melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Deficiency of leptin or its receptors leads to severe obesity.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A hormone found in the bloodstream of humans and other mammals, encoded by the $o b$ (obesity) gene, regulating the amount of food intake and fat deposited in the body. In strains of massively obese mice, it is not synthesized normally, but injections of leptin lead to reduced food intake and weight reduction in both normal and obese mice. It was discovered in mice and humans in 1994 by the US molecular geneticist Jeffrey Friedman (born 1954) and first reported and named in print by Friedman and several collaborators in the journal Science in 1995. Compare Ghrelin. \[From Greek leptos thin, from lepein to peel]
