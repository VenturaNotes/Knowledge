- $n$. a protein that is produced and secreted by adipose tissue (especially white fat) and has a role in the regulation of eating (leptin receptors are concentrated in the hypothalamus). Increased amounts of adipose tissue result in higher concentrations of leptin and a reduction in appetite. A deficiency of leptin is responsible for a few cases of obesity.
