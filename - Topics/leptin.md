## Source [^1]
- $n$. a protein that is produced and secreted by adipose tissue (especially white fat) and has a role in the regulation of eating (leptin receptors are concentrated in the hypothalamus). Increased amounts of adipose tissue result in higher concentrations of leptin and a reduction in appetite. A deficiency of leptin is responsible for a few cases of obesity.
## Source[^2]
- A protein hormone, comprising 167 amino acids in humans, that is secreted by adipose tissue; it suppresses appetite and regulates adipose tissue mass and energy balance. It acts on leptin receptors in the hypothalamus and inhibits expression of neuropeptide Y, thereby countering the appetite-stimulating effects of ghrelin and inhibiting food intake. It also promotes synthesis of the appetite suppressant melanocyte-stimulating hormone. Deficiency of leptin or its receptors leads to severe obesity.
