- A large group of related organisms that, although variations exist between them, cannot be divided into smaller groups of equivalent taxonomic rank to the parent group. Critical groups are found among plants that reproduce by apomixis; for example, the 400 or so species of Rubus (brambles, etc.) are regarded as a critical group.
