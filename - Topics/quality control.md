- The use of sampling, inspection, and testing methods at all levels of system production to produce defect-free hardware and software.
## Source[^2]
- The activities and techniques used to achieve and maintain a high standard of quality in a transformation process. They may include systematic inspection of inputs and outputs, or a sample of inputs and outputs at various stages in their transformation to ensure that acceptable tolerances are not being exceeded. They may also involve a statistical analysis of the data produced by this sampling (particularly in line production); in this case, in traditional organizations, management has to balance the costs incurred against the customer's goodwill (see COST OF QUALITY). Quality control is also concerned with finding, and eliminating, the causes of quality problems. See also SEVEN TOOLS OF QUALITY; Six SIGMA; STATISTICAL PROCESS CONTROL; TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
## Source[^3]
- The system for checking the quality of a product. This may be done before it is sold, and/or at earlier stages of production. Where the checking itself destroys or is liable to damage the product, quality control has to work via sampling batches of products chosen so that they are expected to have common properties, for example those processed on a given date by the same machine. The level of spending on quality control is affected both by commercial considerations of maintaining a reputation for quality, and by legal sanctions imposing penalties or awarding damages for defective products.
