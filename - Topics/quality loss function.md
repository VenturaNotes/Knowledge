- (QLF) A measure of the effectiveness of quality control techniques, which reflects the economic losses incurred by the customer as a result of:
	- maintenance and failure costs;
	- damage to the environment;
	- the costs of operating a product.
- QLF was developed by Genichi Taguchi; it differs from other quality approaches that accept random variation within limits. QLF recognizes that any deviation from the designed specification involves extra cost for the consumer.
