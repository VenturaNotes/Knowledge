- A written agreement between a debtor and his or her creditors that has been registered as such with the Insolvency Service. The agreement may take the form of a composition of debts or a scheme of arrangement of the debtor's affairs. Unlike an individual voluntary arrangement, a deed of arrangement can only be entered into when no bankruptcy order has been made.
