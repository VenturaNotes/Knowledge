- $n$. The existence in a population of variable alleles coding for differences in phenotypic characteristics, such as the alleles coding for different eye colours or different ABO blood types in humans, a gene locus being defined as polymorphic if the most frequent homozygote constitutes less than 90 per cent of the population. It has been estimated that between 20 and 50 per cent of all structural gene loci in humans occur in two or more allelic forms. See also balanced POLYMORPHISM, NEUTRAL MUTATION, POLYMORPHIC GENE, TRANSIENT POLYMORPHISM. \[From Greek polys many + morphe a form or shape]
