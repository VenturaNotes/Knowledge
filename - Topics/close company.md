## Source[^2]
- A company resident in the UK that is under the control of five or fewer participators or any number of participators who are also directors. There is also an alternative asset-based test, which applies if five or fewer participators, or any number who are directors, would be entitled to more than $50 \%$ of the company's assets on a winding-up. The principal consequences of being a close company are that the provision of certain benefits in kind to shareholders can be treated by HM Revenue as a distribution, as can loans or quasi-loans. There are a number of other consequences. In the USA close companies are known as closed companies. See also CLOSE INVESTMENT HOLDING COMPANY.
