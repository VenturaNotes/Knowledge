- A vertex $x_{i}$ on a graph $G$ is a dominator of vertex $x_{j}$, relative to vertex $x_{k}$, if every path from $x_{j}$ to $x_{k}$ traverses $x_{i}$. This is used in flow analysis for code optimization.

- $n$. Anyone or anything that dominates; in visual perception a hypothetical ganglion cell receiving inputs from a group of retinal cones that respond to brightness, its responses being regulated by modulator cells.
