## Source[^2]
- (cane sugar; beet sugar; saccharose) A sugar comprising one molecule of glucose linked to a fructose molecule. It occurs widely in plants and is the principal form in which carbohydrate is exported from photosynthetic cells in leaves to other parts of the plant. It is particularly abundant in sugar cane and sugar beet ($15\text{-}20 \%$), from which it is extracted and refined for table sugar. If heated to $200^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$, sucrose becomes caramel.
