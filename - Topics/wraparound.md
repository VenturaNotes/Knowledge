## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A facility of a VDU or Windows system, allowing it to display lines of text that would otherwise be too long to be displayed completely: the line appears on the screen as two or more successive lines. This division into shorter lines that can fit within the available screen size is a function of the VDU and there is no need for a format character to be included in the data stream. Wraparound may occur when a given number of characters has been received or, in word-processing applications, at word boundaries when it is known as [[word wrap]]. Word wrap is optionally available in spreadsheets and tabular presentation in some word processors; in this case the height of the relevant cells may be adjusted automatically, affecting all cells on that row.
