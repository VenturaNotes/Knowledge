## Synthesis
- "Congestion" refers to a situation where a network is overloaded with too much data traffic, exceeding its available bandwidth. Leads to
	- decreased performance
		- slower speeds
		- packet loss
		- increased latency
	- #question is data traffic the right term? Is it just saying a lot of traffic is caused due to data?
- This all causes the network to become sluggish and unreliable due to the high volume of data trying to pass through at once
## Source [^1]
- Congestion can result in lost packets due to [[buffer overflows|buffer overflow]] at routers
## Source[^2]
- A situation when too many consumers are trying to use the same impure public good simultaneously, and, as a result, the benefit to each user of this public good is reduced. Examples of impure public goods that may suffer from congestion are parks and roads. Congestion is a negative externality: while drivers on crowded roads, for example, are themselves inconvenienced, a cost they bear themselves, they also cause delay, higher fuel costs, and a greater chance of accidents to other road users.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. an accumulation of blood within an organ due to back pressure within its veins (for example congestion of the lungs and of the liver occurs in heart failure). Congestion may be associated with oedema (accumulation of fluid in the tissues). It is relieved by treatment of the cause.
