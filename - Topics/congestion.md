## Source [^1]
- Congestion can result in lost packets due to [[buffer overflows|buffer overflow]] at routers

## Source[^2]
- "Congestion" refers to a situation where a network is overloaded with too much data traffic, exceeding its available bandwidth. Leads to
	- decreased performance
		- slower speeds
		- packet loss
		- increased latency
	- #question is data traffic the right term? Is it just saying a lot of traffic is caused due to data?
- This all causes the network to become sluggish and unreliable due to the high volume of data trying to pass through at once

## Source[^3]
- A situation when too many consumers are trying to use the same impure public good simultaneously, and, as a result, the benefit to each user of this public good is reduced. Examples of impure public goods that may suffer from congestion are parks and roads. Congestion is a negative externality: while drivers on crowded roads, for example, are themselves inconvenienced, a cost they bear themselves, they also cause delay, higher fuel costs, and a greater chance of accidents to other road users.
