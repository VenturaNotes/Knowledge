- $n$. In statistics, a test that several groups come from populations with the same variance. For sufficiently large sample sizes, a non-significant probability allows a researcher to reject the hypothesis that the variances differ. The test assumes that the observations come from normal distributions. \[Named after the English statisticians Maurice Stevenson Bartlett (1910-2002) and George Edward Pelham Box (1919-2013) and the $F$ statistic that it uses]
