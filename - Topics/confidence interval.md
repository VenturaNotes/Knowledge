- An estimation rule that produces with a given probability, when applied to repeated samples, intervals containing the true value of the unknown parameter. Thus, if a large number of samples were drawn from the same population, and an $x$-per cent confidence interval were constructed for each of this sample, then about $x$ per cent of these confidence intervals would contain the true value of the estimated parameter.
