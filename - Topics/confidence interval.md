- An estimation rule that produces with a given probability, when applied to repeated samples, intervals containing the true value of the unknown parameter. Thus, if a large number of samples were drawn from the same population, and an $x$-per cent confidence interval were constructed for each of this sample, then about $x$ per cent of these confidence intervals would contain the true value of the estimated parameter.
## Source[^2]
- A range of values about a parameter estimate such that the probability that the true value of the parameter lies within the range is some fixed value, $\alpha$, known as the confidence level. The upper and lower limits of the range are known as confidence limits. Confidence limits are calculated from the theoretical frequency distribution of the estimating function. The concept may be generalized to several parameters. A confidence region at level $\alpha$ contains the true values of the parameters with probability $\alpha$.
## Source[^3]
- (in statistics) a range of values for a parameter of interest that is estimated to contain the true value of the parameter within a given probability. For example, with a $95 \%$ confidence interval the parameter value will lie in this interval 95 times out of every 100.
