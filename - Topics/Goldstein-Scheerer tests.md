- $n$. A set of tests requiring abstract thinking and concept formation, used to diagnose neurological damage. The tests require the respondent to copy colored designs, to sort items into categories according to color, form, and material, and to reproduce designs from memory by arranging sticks. They were developed in the US by the German-born psychiatrist Kurt Goldstein (1878-1965) and the Germanborn psychologist Martin Scheerer (1900-61) and first published by them in the journal Psychological Monographs in 1941. Later editions of the test are also called the Weigl-Goldstein-Scheerer tests.
