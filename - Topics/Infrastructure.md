- The goods and services, usually requiring substantial investment, considered essential to the proper functioning of an economy. For example, roads, railways, sewerage, and electricity supply constitute essential elements of a community's infrastructure. Since the infrastructure benefits the whole of an economy, it is often argued that it should be funded, partly if not wholly, by the government by means of taxation.

- The capital equipment used to produce publicly available services, including transport and telecommunications, and gas, electricity, and water supplies. These provide an essential background for other economic activities in modern economies; the fact that they are not available or reliable is characteristic of less developed countries, and handicaps their development. Infrastructure services are generally either provided or regulated by the state.
