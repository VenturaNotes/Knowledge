- Commerce everywhere refers to a marketing strategy that enables customers to make a purchase "everywhere." This means that they can make purchases at all physical and digital locations, such as a storefront or via their computer, smartphone, wearable device, etc. This requires extensive back-end work and design work on a business' website, but comes with many advantages and enables speedy, seamless purchases.
