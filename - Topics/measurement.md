- $n$. The systematic assignment of numbers to represent quantitative attributes of objects or events. The US psychologist S(tanley) S(mith) Stevens (1906-73) defined measurement in an article in the journal Science in 1946 and in an influential chapter in his Handbook of Experimental Psychology as 'the assignment of numerals to objects or events according to rules', and this definition is repeated in many textbooks, but it is avoided by many experts because it ignores a crucial (defining) aspect of measurement, namely its connection with quantity or magnitude, and because it includes rule-governed assignments of numbers that do not represent quantities or magnitudes, such as the assignment of telephone numbers to subscribers or of ISBN numbers to books. See also axiomatic MEASUREMENT THEORY, CONJOINT MEASUREMENT THEORY, MEASUREMENT LEVEL, MEASUREMENT MODEL, SCALE (1). \[From Latin mensura a measure, from metiri to measure]
