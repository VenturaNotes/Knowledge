- A graph $G$ whose vertices can be split into two disjoint sets, $U$ and $V$, in such a way that the only edges of $G$ join a vertex in $U$ and a vertex in $V$. Bipartite graphs tend to provide a convenient graphical representation of relations and therefore functions.

## Source[^2]
- A graph in which the vertices can be partitioned into two subsets $V_{1}$ and $V_{2}$, so that no two vertices in $V_{1}$ are joined and no two vertices in $V_{2}$ are joined. The complete bipartite graph $K_{m, n}$ is the bipartite graph with $m$ vertices in $V_{1}$ and $n$ vertices in $V_{2}$, with every vertex in $V_{1}$ joined to every vertex in $V_{2}$ by a single edge.
