## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- two groups of polyunsaturated fatty acids (see UNSATURATED FATTY ACID) that are essential for health but cannot be synthesized by the body. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is the precursor for the omega-3 fatty acids. Good sources include walnuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, rapeseed, soya, and corn oil. ALA can be converted (although not very efficiently) into DHA and EPA (the omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish). Arachidonic acid is not considered an essential fatty acid as it can normally be synthesized from ALA. Linoleic acid is the precursor for the n-6 (or omega-6) fatty acids. Good sources include vegetable oils, such as corn, safflower, soybean, sesame, sunflower, and walnuts. Both omega-3 and omega-6 acids should be consumed in the diet.

- Fatty acids that must normally be present in the diet of certain animals, including humans. Essential fatty acids belong to the omega-6 and omega-3 series of polyunsaturated fatty acids, the parent compounds of which are linoleic acid ( $n\textendash6$ ) and $\alpha$-linolenic acid ( $n\textendash3$ ); all possess double bonds at the same two positions along their hydrocarbon chain (counting positions from the methyl end) and so can act as precursors of eicosanoids, including the prostaglandins. Deficiency of essential fatty acids can cause dermatosis, weight loss, irregular oestrus, etc. Recommendations for dietary intake of essential fatty acids vary, but both $n\textendash3$ and $n\textendash6$ acids should be consumed, ideally in roughly the same amounts.
