## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- two groups of polyunsaturated fatty acids (see UNSATURATED FATTY ACID) that are essential for health but cannot be synthesized by the body. Alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is the precursor for the omega-3 fatty acids. Good sources include walnuts, almonds, pumpkin seeds, flax seeds, rapeseed, soya, and corn oil. ALA can be converted (although not very efficiently) into DHA and EPA (the omega-3 fatty acids found in oily fish). Arachidonic acid is not considered an essential fatty acid as it can normally be synthesized from ALA. Linoleic acid is the precursor for the n-6 (or omega-6) fatty acids. Good sources include vegetable oils, such as corn, safflower, soybean, sesame, sunflower, and walnuts. Both omega-3 and omega-6 acids should be consumed in the diet.
