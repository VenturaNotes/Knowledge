- Two $m \times n$ matrices $M_1, M_2$ are equivalent if there exists an invertible $m \times m$ matrix P and an invertible $n \times n$ matrix Q such that $M_1 = PM_2Q$. If the entries are from a field, then a matrix $M$ is equivalent to $\begin{pmatrix} I_r & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ where $r$ is the rank of $M$. See also SMITH NORMAL FORM.
