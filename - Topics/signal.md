- A disadvantage of wireless networks is that a signal can be weak

## Source[^2]
- (1) A form of data that is usually envisaged as a sequence of values of a scalar quantity-the amplitude-recorded (i.e. measured, tabulated, or plotted) against time. The amplitude is most often, but by no means always, an electric potential. For example, if the signal is a sine wave with a mean value of zero (symmetrical about zero volts), then the amplitude is the value of the peak voltage. See also DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS, SPACE DOMAIN. 
- (2) Any path transmitting some data or function. 
- (3) To convey data or control information from one point to another.
