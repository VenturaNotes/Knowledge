- A combination of two or more businesses on a relatively equal footing that results in the creation of a new reporting entity. The shareholders of the combining entities mutually share the risks and rewards of the new entity and no one party to the merger obtains control over another. Financial Reporting Standard 6, Acquisitions and Mergers, which is now discontinued, laid down four criteria by which a merger may be identified:
	- no party is the acquirer or acquired;
	- all parties to the combination participate in establishing the management structure of the new entity;
	- the combining entities are relatively equal in terms of size;
	- the consideration received by the equity shareholders of each party consists primarily of equity shares in the combined entity, any other consideration received being relatively immaterial.
- However, true mergers (as opposed to disguised takeovers) are very rare in the contemporary business environment. Owing to its widespread abuse, merger accounting has been effectively limited to cases of reconstruction within an existing group.

- A combination of two or more firms into a single new firm. This takes over all the assets and liabilities of the merging firms; shares in the new firm are divided between the shareholders of the original firms on an agreed basis. Merger procedures in the UK are subject to the City Code on Takeovers and Mergers. A merger may allow economies of scale or scope between the firms, which should lead to gains in efficiency. It may, however, also reduce competition, so that mergers in the UK may be referred to the Competition and Markets Authority. See also CONCENTRIC MERGER; CONGLOMERATE MERGER; HORIZONTAL MERGER; VERTICAL MERGER.
