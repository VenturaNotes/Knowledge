- $n$. A scaling method used in psychophysics in which an observer matches the apparent intensities of stimuli across two sensory modalities, as when an observer adjusts the brightness of a light to indicate the loudness of a variable stimulus sound. An unusual but memorable example is the remark made in November 2009 by the English supermodel Kate Moss (born 1974): 'Nothing tastes as good as skinny feels.' Some authorities consider magnitude estimation and magnitude production to be forms of cross-modal matching in which one modality is the observer's perception of the number system. Also called cross-modality matching.
