An area of the retina that when stimulated by a bar or an edge oriented at a particular angle causes a neuron in the primary visual cortex (Area V1) to discharge a nerve impulse, but that elicits a weaker response or no response from the neuron if the length of the stimulus exceeds a certain limit. A cortical neuron that responds in this way is called an end-stopped neuron or end-stopped cell. See also hyperCOMPLEX CELL, RECEPTIVE FIELD.
