- A non-existent benefit. The phrase derives from a 19th-century tavern that advertised free food, it being clearly understood that anyone attempting to exploit this offer without buying a drink would be thrown out. It is now used to convey the idea that wherever there appears to be a free benefit, someone, somewhere, always pays for it. See also FREE RIDE.
