- A non-existent benefit. The phrase derives from a 19th-century tavern that advertised free food, it being clearly understood that anyone attempting to exploit this offer without buying a drink would be thrown out. It is now used to convey the idea that wherever there appears to be a free benefit, someone, somewhere, always pays for it. See also FREE RIDE.
## Source[^2]
- A colloquialism with its root in the expression 'There's no such thing as a free lunch'. A free lunch would be something beneficial obtained for nothing. The expression warns that everything has a price, even if this is not immediately apparent. A production set satisfies the no free lunch assumption if inputs are required to produce output.
