- (Albers-Sch√∂nberg disease, marble-bone disease) n. a congenital abnormality in which bones become abnormally dense and brittle and tend to fracture. Affected bones appear unusually opaque to X-rays. In severe forms, which are inherited as autosomal recessive characteristics, the bone marrow is obliterated, causing anaemia and infections. Mild forms show autosomal dominant inheritance. Treatment is by bone marrow transplantation. See also OSTEOSCLEROSIS.
