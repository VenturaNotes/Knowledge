- A product catalog lists commercial product information, often in a list format. It helps marketing managers promote new products and details product features, measurements, and other information that helps buyers make purchasing decisions. This information might include product dimensions, colors, availability, materials, related parts, weights, production processes, and prices. Catalogs might also include discounts and product and service bundles.
