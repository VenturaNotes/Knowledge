- The achievement of results in the most economical way. This approach assesses efficiency by checking whether resources are being used to produce any given results at the lowest possible cost. Costeffectiveness is most relevant as a concept of efficiency in cases such as the provision of defence, education, health care, policing, or environmental protection, where it is sometimes difficult to measure the monetary value of the results achieved.
