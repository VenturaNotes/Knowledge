- A medium of exchange that functions as a unit of account, a store of value, and a means for deferred payment. Originally money enhanced economic development by enabling goods to be bought and sold without the need for barter. However, throughout history money has been beset by the problem of its debasement as a store of value as a result of inflation. Now that the supply of money is a monopoly of the state, most governments are committed in principle to stable prices. The word 'money' is derived from the Latin moneta, which was one of the names of Juno, the Roman goddess whose temple was used as a mint.
