- A medium of exchange that functions as a unit of account, a store of value, and a means for deferred payment. Originally money enhanced economic development by enabling goods to be bought and sold without the need for barter. However, throughout history money has been beset by the problem of its debasement as a store of value as a result of inflation. Now that the supply of money is a monopoly of the state, most governments are committed in principle to stable prices. The word 'money' is derived from the Latin moneta, which was one of the names of Juno, the Roman goddess whose temple was used as a mint.

- (1) A medium of exchange and store of value. This may consist of physical objects, that is, notes and coin; or of book or computer entries, that is, bank deposits. Money was originally a physical substance such as gold or silver, which was valued for its own sake before it came to be used as coinage. Coins and notes are now usually tokens, whose intrinsic value is below their face value.
- (2) A verbal shorthand for 'monetary policy'. Thus cheap money means that loans are cheap and easily available; tight money or dear money means that loans are expensive and hard to obtain.
- (3) An expression for wealth in general.
