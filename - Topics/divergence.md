- aka div
- For a vector function of position $V(r) = V_xi + V_yj + V_zk$, the divergence of V is the scalar product of the operator del with V giving $$divV = \nabla \bullet V = \frac{\partial V_x}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial V_y}{\partial y} + \frac {\partial V_z}{\partial z}$$
- For a fluid with flow velocity $\bf u$, then $div \bf u$ measures the rate of expansion of the fluid locally. Compare CURL, GRADIENT.

- $n$. 
- (1) (in ophthalmology) simultaneous abduction of the eyes. Divergence excess is a divergent squint (see STRABISMUS) in which the eyes are deviated outwards more when looking in the distance than when looking at near objects. Divergence insufficiency is a convergent squint (see STRABISMUS) in which the eyes are deviated slightly inwards only when looking in the distance. 
- (2) (in ethics) a difference of opinion.
