- Multiplication of matrices where the entries are submatrices rather than single elements; the submatrices still multiply as if they were entries. For example, given two $3 \times 3$ matrices of the form$$

A_{1}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}

M_{1} & v_{1} \\

w_{1} & c_{1}

\end{array}\right) \text { and } A_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{ll}

M_{2} & v_{2} \\

w_{2} & c_{2}

\end{array}\right)

$$where the $\mathbf{M}_{i}, \mathbf{v}_{i}, \mathbf{w}_{i}, c_{i}$ are respectively $2 \times 2,2 \times 1,1 \times 2,1 \times 1$ matrices, then their product equals$$

A_{1} A_{2}=\left(\begin{array}{cc}

M_{1} M_{2}+v_{1} w_{2} & M_{1} v_{2}+v_{1} c_{2} \\

w_{1} M_{2}+c_{1} w_{2} & c_{1} c_{2}

\end{array}\right)

$$
