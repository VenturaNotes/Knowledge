- Unemployment that occurs as a result of the seasonal nature of some jobs. The building trade, for example, employs more people in the summer months than the winter months. Much of the seaside holiday trade is seasonal and a considerable amount of agricultural work is seasonal. It is for this reason that UK unemployment figures are usually seasonally adjusted, i.e. adjusted to flatten the peaks and troughs of unemployment in certain seasons.
