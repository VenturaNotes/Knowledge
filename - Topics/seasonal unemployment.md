- Unemployment that occurs as a result of the seasonal nature of some jobs. The building trade, for example, employs more people in the summer months than the winter months. Much of the seaside holiday trade is seasonal and a considerable amount of agricultural work is seasonal. It is for this reason that UK unemployment figures are usually seasonally adjusted, i.e. adjusted to flatten the peaks and troughs of unemployment in certain seasons.
## Source[^2]
- Unemployment due to seasonal variations in the demand for labour. Some occupations have large seasonal variations, for example agriculture and tourism. How far this leads to seasonal variations in aggregate unemployment depends on how far such variations are mutually offsetting.
