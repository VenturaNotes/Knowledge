- Hypertext Markup Language (better known as HTML) is a document-formatting language that is used for the creation of Web pages and online apps. Essentially, it is a code that allows authors to dictate the structure of a Web page and how it is displayed in a web browser. Some of the most common uses of HTML include publishing online documents (blog posts, for example) that contain headings, photos, or tables. Additionally, HTML is used to create forms that enable online transactions to occur, and also provides the ability to add videos, sounds, and spreadsheets throughout a document.
