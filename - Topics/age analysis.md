- A listing of debtors' accounts (i.e. the amounts owing to a business), usually produced monthly, which analyses the age of the debts by splitting them into such categories as those up to one month old, two months old, and more than two months old. As a basic part of the credit control system, the analysis should be regularly examined so that any appropriate follow-up action may be taken.
