- The sale of goods or services to a consumer in which the parties do not meet, such as sale by mail order, telephone, digital TV, e-mail, or the Internet. The EU distance selling directive implemented from October 2000 in the UK by the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling) Regulations 2000 contains the relevant law. In particular, consumers have rights to certain information about the contract to be entered into and, in many cases, the right to cancel the contract within a certain period, often seven working days from the day after receipt of the goods. The right applies whether the goods are defective or not, but it does not apply in certain important categories (such as auctions, betting, goods specifically made for a consumer, and food that will deteriorate).
