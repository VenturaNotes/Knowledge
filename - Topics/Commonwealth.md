- The Commonwealth of Nations is a confederation of 53 member nations that were formerly members of the British Empire (Mozambique is the exception), and was formerly known as the British Commonwealth. The appointed head of the Commonwealth is Queen Elizabeth II. The Declaration of Commonwealth Principles issued in 1971 stresses the need to foster international peace and security, democracy, liberty of the individual, and equal rights for all, and also the importance of eradicating poverty, ignorance, and disease; it opposes all forms of racial discrimination.
