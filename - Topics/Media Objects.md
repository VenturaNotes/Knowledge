- Media objects are any kind of media files, including photos, GIFs, and audio and video files. The term is generally used in HTML coding, where media objects are considered non-HTML files or apps. In an HTML code or document, media object is the section that represents the actual media. It could be a link to a hosted image or a connection to a business's repository of objects. Different kinds of companies have different types of media objects. For instance, an architectural firm may have plenty of 3D models to display on its website; these are also media objects.
