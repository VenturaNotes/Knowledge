- A group of cells that forms during the early development of the fertilized egg in mammals. Evident at the blastocyst stage (see blastula), it is destined to form the embryo proper and consists of embryonic stem cells. The inner cell mass is clustered at one end of the blastocyst cavity (blastocoel), and both are enclosed in the saclike trophoblast.
