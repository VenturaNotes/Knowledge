- $n$. A visible object, symbol, or representation of something else, especially (in social psychology) a gesture (1) that functions as a substitute for a verbal expression. Many non-verbal emblems, including waving the hand for goodbye, putting a forefinger to the lips for silence, or crossing two fingers for good luck, have wide cross-cultural consistency, whereas others are regionally specific: making a ring with the thumb and forefinger indicates $O K$ in the US and northern Europe, whereas in southern Europe it conveys nothing or zero, and in Japan money; and the chin-flick emblem (tapping the back of the fingers against the underside of the chin) means get lost in France and northern Italy but is largely unknown in the UK and the US. See also KINESICS, SUBMISSIVE BEHAVIOR. emblematic or emblematical adj. \[From Latin emblema a raised decoration or mosaic, from Greek emblema something inserted, from en in + ballein to throw]
