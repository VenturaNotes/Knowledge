- (lactogenic hormone, luteotrophic hormone, luteotrophin) $n$. a hormone, synthesized and stored in the anterior pituitary gland, that stimulates milk production after childbirth and also stimulates production of progesterone by the corpus luteum in the ovary. Excessive secretion of prolactin, resulting in raised serum levels of the hormone (hyperprolactinaemia), is usually due to the presence of a pituitary adenoma (see PROLACTINOMA); other causes include dopamine receptor antagonists (e.g. antipsychotic drugs) and chronic renal failure.
