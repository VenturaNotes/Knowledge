## Source [^1]
- (lactogenic hormone, luteotrophic hormone, luteotrophin) $n$. a hormone, synthesized and stored in the anterior pituitary gland, that stimulates milk production after childbirth and also stimulates production of progesterone by the corpus luteum in the ovary. Excessive secretion of prolactin, resulting in raised serum levels of the hormone (hyperprolactinaemia), is usually due to the presence of a pituitary adenoma (see PROLACTINOMA); other causes include dopamine receptor antagonists (e.g. antipsychotic drugs) and chronic renal failure.
## Source[^2]
- (lactogenic hormone; luteotrophic hormone; luteotrophin) A hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland in response to the release of prolactin-releasing hormone from the hypothalamus. In mammals it stimulates the mammary glands to secrete milk (see lactation) and the corpus luteum of the ovary to secrete the hormone progesterone. Secretion of prolactin is increased by suckling. In birds prolactin stimulates secretion of crop milk by the crop glands.
