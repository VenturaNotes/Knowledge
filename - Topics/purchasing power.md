- Refers to the amount of products and services available for purchase with a certain currency unit

- The ability to purchase goods and services. In times of inflation a loss of purchasing power occurs when monetary assets are held because of the decline in the purchasing power of the currency. If a company has monetary liabilities, a purchasing power gain will arise because the absolute sum of the loans will be repaid with currency with less purchasing power.

- The amount of real goods and services each unit of money will buy. Purchasing power is thus the reciprocal of a suitable price index: if prices go up, the purchasing power of money goes down.
