- A one-way function is an invertible function, which itself involves relatively little computation, but the inverse is computationally much more onerous. For example, multiplying two large prime numbers is straightforward for a computer, but factorizing the product is considerably more time-consuming. A second example is the discrete logarithm. One-way functions are important in public key cryptography. See cryptography, RSA
