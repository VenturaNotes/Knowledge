- A form of notation invented by the Polish mathematician Jan Lukasiewicz, in which each operator follows its operands. Thus, for example, $$\begin{align}&a + b \text{ is written }ab+ \\&a+b*c\text { is written } abc^*+\end{align}$$If each operator has a specific number of operands (e.g. if all operators take exactly two operands), then no brackets are required since the order of evaluation is always uniquely defined; the notation can then be described as parenthesis-free.
- The importance of RPN is that an expression in this form can be readily evaluated on a stack. Thus translation to RPN, followed by stack evaluation, is a simple but effective strategy for dealing with arithmetic expressions in a programming language. See also Polish Notation
