- A type of corporate restructuring in which a parent company divests itself of a wholly-owned subsidiary by giving its members the chance to exchange their shares for shares in the subsidiary, which thereby becomes an independent undertaking. In contrast to a spin-off, where shares are distributed automatically, the parent makes a tender to its shareholders, who can choose whether or not to acquire shares in the new company. A premium is often used to encourage the exchange. See also CARVE-OUT.
