- n. A movement involving political philosophy and psychology founded at the Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt in Germany, closed by the Nazis in 1933, and re-established in 1934 at Columbia University in New York. Its leading figures included Max Horkheimer (1895-1973), Theodor W(iesengrund) Adorno (1903-69), and Herbert Marcuse (1898-1979), who were united by a belief in the possibility and desirability of a Marxist critical theory and a rejection of positivism (1, 2).
