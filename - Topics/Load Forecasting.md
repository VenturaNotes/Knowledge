- Load forecasting is a type of measurement that is deployed by a utility, such as a water authority or electricity company. It is used to estimate the "load," or demand, for that particular utility. Accurate load forecasting can ensure that a utility has appropriate resources to meet the necessary demand. This, in turn, can impact energy consumption and staffing needs.
