- A practice in which websites identify a particular browser (and by extension, a particular user) by collecting and combining distinguishing features of the browser and underlying operating system. 
- Elements of a fingerprint might include
	- Browser version
	- Timezone and preferred language
	- Set of video or audio [[codec|codecs]] available on the system
	- Fonts installed on the system
	- State of the browser's settings
	- Computer's display size and resolution
- A website can retrieve this information by executing JavaScript and CSS on the device, and combining this data can often create a unique fingerprint for a browser, which can then be used to track users across the web
- Web standards are designed to minimize the ability of a website to collect identifying information, and browsers typically add their own protections as well
- #question How does it know which websites I visit?
