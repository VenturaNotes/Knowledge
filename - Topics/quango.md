- Acronym for quasi-autonomous government organization. Such bodies, some members of which are likely to be civil servants and some not, are appointed by a minister to perform some public function at the public expense. Examples are the Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service and the Health and Safety Executive. While not actually government agencies, they are not independent and are usually answerable to a government minister.
