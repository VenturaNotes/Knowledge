## Source [^1]
- $n$. a metallic element used in the form of its salts (lithium carbonate and lithium citrate) to prevent and treat episodes of mania or depression in patients with bipolar affective disorder, and sometimes chronic or recurrent depression. Side-effects include tremor, weakness, nausea, thirst, and excessive urination. Thyroid function can be impaired after many years of use and regular thyroid function tests are compulsory. Reversible changes in the kidney as well as diabetes insipidus can appear after longterm lithium treatment. The therapeutic range of lithium is relatively small, therefore levels of lithium in the blood are regularly checked during long-term therapy.
