- Economic assistance from one country to another, the recipient typically being a less developed country. Aid is usually intended either to provide humanitarian relief in emergencies, to promote economic development, or to finance military expenditure. Aid may take the form of outright gifts of money, which may be tied to purchases from the donor, or untied and available for expenditure anywhere. It may take the form of soft loans, on terms easier than those available to the borrower in the world capital market. Aid may also be given in kind, including food, plant and equipment, military supplies, or technical assistance. Bilateral aid is given directly by a donor to a recipient country; multilateral aid is channelled through an international organization, without direct contact between donors and particular recipients. See also GRANT IN AID; TIED AID; UNTIED AID.
