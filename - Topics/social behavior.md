- Any behavior exhibited by a group of animals that interact with each other. Social behavior ranges from moving as a herd in order to minimize the effects of predators to performing designated roles in highly organized societies. For example, within a colony of bees specific tasks, including tending the larvae, foraging for food, and controlling the temperature within the colony by wing fanning, are performed by different individuals (see CASTE; SUPERORGANISM). The application of evolutionary theory to social behavior is termed sociobiology. This field is concerned primarily with genetically determined aspects of behavior and their adaptive significance in terms of natural selection and reproductive success. See also EUSOCIAL.
