- A two-player game that illustrates the potential costs of conflict. The game considers two drivers who head directly at each other on a narrow road. Each driver aims to hold their nerve and continue straight while forcing the other driver to swerve (to 'chicken out' of the conflict). If both head straight a crash is inevitable. This information is summarized in the pay-off matrix.

- The game has two pure-strategy Nash equilibria, {Swerve, Straight} and {Straight, Swerve}. The difficulty for the players, and the interesting feature of the game, is that the players have no method for determining which of these equilibria will emerge in any particular play of the game. The players benefit from anti-coordination (two players using different strategies), but the game has no mechanism to achieve this. An alternative is to play the mixed strategy equilibrium because this is symmetric between the players. However, there is then a positive probability that the worst outcome, {Straight, Straight}, will occur.
