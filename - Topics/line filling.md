- Adding products to an existing line of products in order to leave no opportunities for competitors. Line filling can be horizontal or vertical. In horizontal line filling, a video manufacturer may produce machines with a variety of features, such as half-speed copying, multi-recording memory, etc., at the top end of the price range, and relatively cheap cost-effective machines at the opposite end; a competitor can therefore only compete on price. In vertical line-filling a manufacturer may produce a wide variety of brand names within a single product line; some detergent manufacturers do this. Compare LINE EXTENDING.
