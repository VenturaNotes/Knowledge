- The last (usually rightmost) rule of an incomplete decision table, i.e. a table that does not include all possible combinations of conditions. The ELSE rule defines the step set for all actions not satisfying the explicit rules of the decision table. A table with an ELSE rule is complete since all possible combinations are taken into consideration.
