- Privacy management tools help organizations improve privacy and conduct privacy impact assessments, evaluate user awareness about internal data privacy policies, and ensure data processing activities adhere to data privacy regulations.Â These tools can investigate, report, and remedy incidents that result in data breaches. They can also analyze and report personal data that flows through an organization and guide the data controller responsible for that information.
