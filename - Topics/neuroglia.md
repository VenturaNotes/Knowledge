The web of non-neural cells forming the connecting tissue that surrounds and supports neurons in the nervous system, outnumbering neurons by about 10 to 1, and divided into macroglia and microglia. Also called glia for short. Often mistakenly assumed to be a plural of neuroglion (a spurious back formation), but in fact singular like the phrase nerve glue. See also astrocyte, ependymal cell, gliosis, oligodendrocyte, satellite cell, Schwann cell. neuroglial adj. \[Coined in 1846 by the German pathologist Rudolf Ludwig Karl Virchow (1821-1902) from Greek neuron a nerve + glia glue]
