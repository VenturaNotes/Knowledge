## Source[^2]
- “life’s fundamental unit of structure and function.” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=54&annotation=HITCDQ8V))

## Source[^3]
- (1) An address, a location in memory, or a register, usually one capable of holding a binary number. It is sometimes a location capable of holding one bit. 
- (2) The basic unit of a spreadsheet or some other table of text, formed by the intersection of a row and column. It contains a label, value, or formula with attributes such as size, font, and color. 
- (3) The name given to a packet in one version of a packet switching system. Packet switching systems subdivide the data to be transmitted into a number of packets. In contrast to many systems, a cell is short-for instance 53 bytes in the case of an ATM cell—and its internal structure is fixed. Small size and fixed structure allow the cell to be switched using a very simple algorithm; the processing time required for switching is thus reduced, with a corresponding increase in the number of cells switched in a given time. 
- (4) The coverage area provided by a base station to a mobile (wireless) phone. As the user moves geographically, the conversation is 'handed over' to another cell at another base station.
