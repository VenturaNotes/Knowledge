- “life’s fundamental unit of structure and function.” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 51](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=54&annotation=HITCDQ8V))

- (1) An address, a location in memory, or a register, usually one capable of holding a binary number. It is sometimes a location capable of holding one bit. 
- (2) The basic unit of a spreadsheet or some other table of text, formed by the intersection of a row and column. It contains a label, value, or formula with attributes such as size, font, and color. 
- (3) The name given to a packet in one version of a packet switching system. Packet switching systems subdivide the data to be transmitted into a number of packets. In contrast to many systems, a cell is short-for instance 53 bytes in the case of an ATM cell—and its internal structure is fixed. Small size and fixed structure allow the cell to be switched using a very simple algorithm; the processing time required for switching is thus reduced, with a corresponding increase in the number of cells switched in a given time. 
- (4) The coverage area provided by a base station to a mobile (wireless) phone. As the user moves geographically, the conversation is 'handed over' to another cell at another base station.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. the basic unit of all living organisms, which can reproduce itself exactly (see mitosis). Each cell is bounded by a cell membrane of lipids and protein, which controls the passage of substances into and out of the cell. Cells contain cytoplasm, in which are suspended a nucleus and other structures (organelles) specialized to carry out particular activities in the cell (see illustration).
- Complex organisms are built up of millions of cells that are specially adapted to carry out particular functions. The process of cell differentiation begins early on in the development of the embryo and cells of a particular type (e.g. blood cells, liver cells) always give rise to cells of the same type. Each cell has a particular number of chromosomes in its nucleus. The sex cells (sperm and ova) always contain half the number of chromosomes of all the other cells of the body (see MEIosis); at fertilization a sperm and ovum combine to form a cell with a complete set of chromosomes that will develop into the embryo.

## Source[^4]
- The structural and functional unit of most living organisms (compare COENOCYTE; SYNCYTIUM). Cell size varies, but most cells are microscopic (average diameter $0.01-0.1$ mm ). Cells may exist as independent units of life, as in bacteria and certain protists, or they may form colonies or tissues, as in all plants and animals. Each is differentiated into cytoplasm and a nucleus, which contains DNA, and is bounded by a plasma membrane, which in the cells of plants, fungi, algae, and bacteria is surrounded by a cell wall. There are two main types of cell. In prokaryotic cells (bacteria and archaea) the nuclear material is not bounded by a membrane and chemicals involved in cell metabolism are associated with the plasma membrane. Reproduction is generally asexual and involves simple cell cleavage. In eukaryotic cells the nucleus is bounded by a nuclear membrane and the cytoplasm is divided by membranes into a system of interconnected cavities and separate compartments (organelles), e.g. mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, and ribosomes (see illustration). The shape and internal organization of cells depends on a network of tubules and filaments called the cytoskeleton. Reproduction can be either asexual (see mitosis) or sexual (see meiosis). Plants and animals consist of eukaryotic cells but plant cells possess chloroplasts and other plastids and bear a rigid cellulose cell wall.
