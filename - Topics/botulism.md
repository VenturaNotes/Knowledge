- $n$. a rare and potentially life-threatening form of food poisoning due to ingestion of foods contaminated with toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum. Botulinum toxin selectively targets motor nerve fibres of the central nervous system, causing flaccid paralysis. As the disease progresses, involvement of the muscles of respiration leads to respiratory failure and death. The bacterium thrives in improperly preserved foods, typically canned raw meats. The toxins are unstable to heat and are invariably destroyed during cooking.
