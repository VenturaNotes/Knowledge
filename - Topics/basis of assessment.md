- The basis upon which personal income or business profits are assessed in the UK for each fiscal year. The individual rules for each income-tax schedule identify the profits or income to be assessed in that year. These rules are complex and the advice of a tax expert should be sought. The basis of assessment does not necessarily equate to the actual tax year. In the case of a partnership that has been trading for many years, the profits for the year to 30 April 2015, i.e. those arising during the period 1 May 2014-30 April 2015, will form the basis of the assessment for the tax year 2015-16. This is known as the current-year basis of assessment. Other income received during the year, e.g. building society interest received, is assessed on an actual basis and so for 2015-16 the basis of assessment will be the tax year, i.e. the interest received during the year 6 April 2015-5 April 2016.
