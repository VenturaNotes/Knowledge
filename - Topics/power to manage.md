- The power to direct the affairs of a company, particularly as this is distributed between the general meeting of members and the board of directors. The distribution of power is usually made clear in the company's constitution; for example, the model articles of association contained in schedule 1-3 of the Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008 provide that there is a wide power of management vested with the board of directors.
