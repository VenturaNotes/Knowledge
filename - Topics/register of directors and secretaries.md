- A register listing the directors and the secretary of a UK company, which must be kept at its registered office. It must state the full names of the directors and the company secretary, an address for each, the nationality of directors, particulars of other directorships held, the occupation of directors, and in the case of a public company, their dates of birth. If the function of director or secretary is performed by another company, the name and registered office of that company must be given. The register must be available for inspection by members of the company free of charge and it may be inspected by the public for a small fee. Under the Companies Act 2006 directors may include a service address, rather than their residential address, in the register that is seen by the public.
