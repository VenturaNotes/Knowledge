- The theory that the contact between different locations is ruled by an inverse square law, similar to that governing gravitation. A consumer's custom, for example, is divided between possible shopping centers in proportion to $1 / x_{i}{ }^{2}$, where $x_{i}$ is the distance to center $i$. This model has also been applied to explain the patterns of international trade between countries.
