- A concept from graph theory concerned with whether there is a path between two vertices in a directed graph. Vertex $V$ is said to be reachable from vertex $U$ provided that there is a path from $U$ to $V$. There may be several different paths from one vertex to another, the shortest being called a geodesic. The set of points that can be reached from a given vertex $V$ is called the reachable set of $V$.
- A directed graph is unilaterally connected when, for any pair of vertices, at least one vertex is reachable from the other.
