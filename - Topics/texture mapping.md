- (decal) A method of changing the surface representation of an object to give the impression that the surface is patterned in a defined way without explicitly modelling it as part of the surface geometry. It allows complex surface rendering without the enormous computation needed if the geometric surface was defined and then rendered. The texture may determine or modify any surface characteristic, including color, reflectivity, transparency, or even surface normals.
