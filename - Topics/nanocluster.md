- (nanomaterial) Particles between about 1 and 50 nanometres in diameter that are made up of atoms or molecules. The properties of nanoclusters are different from those of the isolated atoms or molecules and also of solids made up of these atoms or molecules; the properties depend on the size of the nanocluster. There are many ways of preparing nanoclusters.
