- Awards to British industry instituted by royal warrant in 1976 to replace the Queen's Award to Industry, which was instituted in 1965. The Queen's Award for International Trade is given for a sustained increase in overseas earnings to an outstanding level for the products or services concerned and for the size of the applicants' organizations. The Queen's Award for Innovation is given for outstanding or continuous innovation in the production, development, or distribution of goods or the performance of services. There are also two more recent categories: the Queen's Award for Sustainable Development and the Queen's Award for Enterprise Promotion (which is awarded to an individual, rather than a company). The awards are announced on the Queen's actual birthday (21 April). Awards are held for five years and entitle the holders to fly a special flag and display on their packages, stationery, etc., the emblem of the award.
