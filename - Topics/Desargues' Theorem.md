- Consider two triangles ABC and $A'B'C'$ lying in the (projective) plane. The theorem states that if the lines $AA', BB',$ and $CC'$ are concurrent at O, then BC and $B'C'$ intersect at a point L, CA and $C'A'$ intersect at M, and AB and $A'B'$ intersect at $N$, where L, M, and N are collinear.

	- The center and axis of a perspectivity
- O is called the center of perspectivity of the triangles ABC and $A'B'C$ and the line $LMN$ is called the axis of perspectivity. The dual of Desargues's Theorem is then its converse
