- Minutes of use (MOUs) measure a wireless user's total circuit-switched voice connection time. The term originated with analog telephone service. Today, the term is still used to measure digital communication patterns, including cell phone use and internet use. Although MOUs indicate â€˜minutes,' the MOUs are often given as monthly totals for billing and other IT purposes.
