- (PCI) treatment of coronary artery disease delivered by cardiac catheterization. This usually means coronary angioplasty followed by insertion of a coronary stent, but also includes more specialized procedures, such as rotational atherectomy (rotablation). Primary PCI refers to the use of PCI as the first-line treatment to relieve coronary obstruction in S-T elevation myocardial infarction, rather than thrombolysis. Rescue PCI is used in the event of unsuccessful thrombolysis.
