- (SBP) the presence of infection in the abdominal cavity without an obvious cause (see PERITONITIS). SBP occurs in patients with liver disease (and occasionally in those with nephrotic syndrome) due to portal hypertension. This leads to the build-up of large volumes of peritoneal fluid (ascites) in which infection takes hold and propagates. Patients experience fever, nausea, abdominal pain, further accumulation of ascites, and they may develop hepatic encephalopathy with rapid deterioration. Diagnosis is made by paracentesis culture of the ascitic fluid to confirm the presence of bacteria. Treatment includes antibiotics.
