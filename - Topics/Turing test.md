- A test proposed by the mathematician and artificial intelligence pioneer Alan Turing to decide whether an intelligent system has reached a level of competence comparable to that of human beings. The essential idea is to communicate with an unknown entity-by means of a keyboard and/or screen-and decide, on the basis of answers to questions, whether the responding agent is another person or a computer system. Many artificial-intelligence programs can pass the Turing test if restricted to a very severely limited domain, but asking general questions about the wider world of human experience soon exposes their shortcomings. Several variations of the test exist and it is still a topic of philosophical debate.
