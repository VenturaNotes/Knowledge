- $n$. An alphabet containing 44 characters, each of which corresponds to a single sound or phoneme of English, designed to simplify and facilitate the teaching of reading, with upper-case (capital) letters being written simply as larger versions of the lower-case letters. It was introduced in 1959 by the English educationalist Sir (Isaac) James Pitman (1901-85), not as a proposal to reform English spelling, but to help children learning to read. ITA abbrev.
