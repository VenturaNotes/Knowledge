- $n$. the presence of albumin in the urine at levels that are higher than normal ( $>30 ~\mathrm{mg} / 24$ hours) but lower than those detected by standard urine protein dipsticks ( $>300 ~\mathrm{mg} / 24$ hours). The usual screening method for microalbuminuria is to measure the microalbumin:creatinine ratio. In people with diabetes microalbuminuria is an important risk factor for the development of progressive kidney damage and (particularly in those with type 2 diabetes) coronary heart disease. At an early stage of microalbuminuria its presence may be reversed by careful control of blood pressure and blood glucose.
