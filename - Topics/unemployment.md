- An inability to find work although it is actively sought. Theoretically the unemployed are those members of the active labour force who are out of work, although in most cases statistics are based on the number of people claiming jobseeker's allowance. Unemployment has been a persistent problem in industrial economies during recession over the last 200 years. See also FRICTIONAL UNEMPLOYMENT; HIDDEN UNEMPLOYMENT; RESIDUAL UNEMPLOYMENT; SEASONAL UNEMPLOYMENT.

- Inability to obtain a job when one is willing and able to work. This can be measured in two ways: official registration with a state agency, which carries some form of income support, and through the self-assessment of a random sample of the population. Self-assessment generally produces higher figures.
