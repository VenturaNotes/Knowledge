- The effective constraint on the maximum speed or level of an activity. Its use in economics is a physical analogy to the maximum rate at which a liquid can be poured through the neck of a bottle. In production, transport, or administration, the effective constraint is often a shortage of some specific form of labour or some particular piece of equipment. A major role of efficient management is to observe and remedy bottlenecks as they arise, or still better to foresee them and take action in time to prevent them from emerging.

- A point of congestion in a system. The congestion occurs when workloads arrive at that point more quickly than they can normally be handled; the result is often a queue and a longer processing time. Bottlenecks are commonly found in network interconnection, when a faster network is connected to a slower one. A bottleneck may also be the element of a system that consumes the greatest quantity of a resource that is needed by other elements in the system, thus slowing down the whole system's execution.
