- $n$. the application of a pulling force, especially as a means of counteracting the natural tension in the tissues surrounding a broken bone (see COUNTERTRACTION), to produce correct alignment of the fragments. Considerable force, exerted with weights, ropes, and pulleys, may be necessary to ensure that a broken femur is kept correctly positioned during the early stages of healing. Traction is also used for the treatment of back pain by physiotherapists.
