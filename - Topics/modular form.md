- A modular form of weight $k$ is a holomorphic function on the upper half plane $Imz > 0$, such that $f((az +b)/(cz +d)) = (cz + d)^kf(z)$ and $f(z)$ can be expressed as a Fourier series $$f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c(n)e^{2\pi inz}$$where the Fourier coefficients $c(n)$ are integers. Note that $f(z+1) = f(z)$ and so modular forms have period 1. The only function with odd weight is the zero function
