- A vertebrate whose embryos are totally enclosed in a fluid-filled sacâ€”the amnion. The evolution of the amnion provided the necessary fluid environment for the developing embryo and therefore allowed animals to breed away from water. Amniotes comprise the reptiles, birds, and mammals. Compare ANAMNIOTE.
