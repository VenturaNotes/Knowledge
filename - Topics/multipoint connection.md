- A connection of a number of terminals in parallel, analogous to a multidrop connection. Sometimes the terms are used synonymously, although multidrop strictly implies that the connections are all served from a common connection point (node), whereas multipoint implies that connections are made through a series of (analogue) bridging connections where some or all of the terminals are served by different common carrier offices interconnected by communication trunks.
