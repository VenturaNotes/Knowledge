- drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms: a potentially fatal reaction to medications, also called anticonvulsant and drug-induced hypersensitivity syndrome. It is characterized by a nonspecific skin rash and variable other symptoms, such as fever, lymphadenopathy, full blood count abnormalities, organ (e.g. liver) dysfunction, and malaise. Common drug culprits include anticonvulsants and antibiotics, although many others have been reported to cause it. Prompt withdrawal of the suspected drug is critical for recovery, but sometimes the reaction can be prolonged, even after drug withdrawal.
