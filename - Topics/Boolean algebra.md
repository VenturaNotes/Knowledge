- A branch of algebra where the variables have one of two possible values â€” True or False. These values are often expressed as 1 and 0.

- An algebra that is particularly important in computing. Formally it is a complemented distributive lattice. In a Boolean algebra there is a set of elements $B$ that consists of only 0 and 1 . Further there will be two dyadic operations, usually denoted by $\Lambda$ and $v$ (or by. and + ) and called and and or respectively. There is also a monadic operation, denoted here by ', and known as the complement operation. These operations satisfy a series of laws, given in the table, where $x, y$, and $z$ denote arbitrary elements of $B$.

  

There are two very common examples of Boolean algebras. The first consists of the set

  

$$

B=\{\text { FALSE, TRUE }\}

$$

  

with the dyadic AND and OR operations replacing $\Lambda$ and $v$ respectively, and the NOT operation producing complements. Thus 1 and 0 are just TRUE and FALSE respectively. This idea can be readily extended to the set of all $n$-tuples

  

$$

\left(x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)

$$

  

where each $x_{i}$ is in $B$. The AND and OR operations are then extended to operate between

  

corresponding pairs of elements in each $n$-tuple to produce another $n$-tuple; the NOT operation negates each item of an $n$-tuple.

  

The second common example of a Boolean algebra is the set of subsets of a given set $S$, with the operations of intersection and union replacing $\Lambda$ and $\vee$ respectively; set complement fills the role of Boolean algebra complement.

  

Boolean algebras, named for George Boole, the 19th-century English mathematician, are fundamental to many aspects of computing-logic design, logic itself, and aspects of algorithm design. See table.

## Source[^3]
- A set of elements defined with two binary operations ( $\lor$ and $\land$ ), a unary operation $(\neg)$ and two elements 0 and 1 which possess the following properties:
	- (i) Both operations $\lor$ and $\land$ are commutative and associative.
	- (ii) 0 is an identity for addition and 1 is an identity for multiplication.
	- (iii) Each operation $\lor$ and $\land$ is distributive over the other.
	- (iv) $a \vee(\neg a)=1$ and $a \wedge(\neg a)=0$ for all $a$.
- For example, a power set $\wp(X)$, where $\lor$ is union, $\land$ is intersection, $\neg$ is complentation in $X$, and 0 is the empty set and 1 is $X$, is a Boolean algebra. Compare BOOLEAN RING; see also STONE SPACE.
