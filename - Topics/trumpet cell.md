## Source [^1]
- An elongated cell, large numbers of which are joined end to end to transport photosynthate (sugar) through the bodies of brown algae. The end walls are perforated with holes forming a sieve, analogous to the arrangement of sieve elements in phloem. However, trumpet cells and sieve elements are not homologous structures, but an example of convergent evolution.
