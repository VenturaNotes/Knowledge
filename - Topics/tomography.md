- $n$. a technique used to produce an image (tomogram) of structures at a particular depth within the body by bringing them into sharp focus while deliberately blurring structures above and below them. In plain film tomography the source of X-rays and the photographic film are moved around the patient to produce a single 'slice' at a time. By contrast, multiple slices are produced in computerized tomography (CT), which uses multiple radiation detectors so that the images can be stacked up to give additional three-dimensional information. See also DENTAL PANTOMOGRAM; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; SPECT SCANNING.
