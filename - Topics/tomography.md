- $n$. a technique used to produce an image (tomogram) of structures at a particular depth within the body by bringing them into sharp focus while deliberately blurring structures above and below them. In plain film tomography the source of X-rays and the photographic film are moved around the patient to produce a single 'slice' at a time. By contrast, multiple slices are produced in computerized tomography (CT), which uses multiple radiation detectors so that the images can be stacked up to give additional three-dimensional information. See also DENTAL PANTOMOGRAM; POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY; SPECT SCANNING.
## Source[^2]
- The use of X-rays to photograph a selected plane of a human body with other planes eliminated. The CT (computerized tomography) scanner is a ring-shaped X-ray machine that rotates through $180^{\circ}$ around the horizontal patient, making numerous X-ray measurements every few degrees. The vast amount of information acquired is built into a three-dimensional image of the tissues under examination by the scanner's own computer. The patient is exposed to a dose of X-rays only a fraction of that used in a normal diagnostic X-ray. See also POSITRON EMISSION TOMOGRAPHY.
