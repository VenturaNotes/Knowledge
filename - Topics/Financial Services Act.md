- UK legislation enacted in 2012 that introduced a new regulatory framework for the financial system and financial services in the UK. The legislation was motivated by the perceived failure of the regulatory system as a contributory factor to the 2009 financial crisis. Since 2013 the UK financial system has been regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority, the Prudential Regulation Authority, and the Financial Policy Committee.
