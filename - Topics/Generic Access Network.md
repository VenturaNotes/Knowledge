- A generic access network (GAN) enables users to connect their mobile devices through wireless networks without having specific hardware requirements or subscriptions for each service provider. This is made possible by using a common platform that all service providers can use, eliminating the need for customers to go through a lengthy process of registering and setting up their devices each time they want to use a different provider's services.
