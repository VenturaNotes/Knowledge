## Source [^1]
- any one of a group of mental disorders characterized by a partial or complete loss of the normal integration between awareness of one's own identity, memories of the past, and control of bodily movements. They tend to remit spontaneously after hours, days, or months. The symptoms are explained psychoanalytically as extreme defence mechanisms. They include loss of memory for important personal details (see AMNESIA), wandering away from home (see FUGUE), the assumption of a new identity, and trancelike states with severely reduced response to external stimuli. Conversion disorder is classified with dissociative disorders (as dissociative (conversion) disorders) in ICD-10 (see International Classification of Diseases).
