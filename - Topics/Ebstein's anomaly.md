- a form of congenital heart disease affecting the right side of the heart: the tricuspid valve is displaced towards the apex to a varying extent, resulting in impaired right ventricular function. It can cause breathlessness, failure to thrive, cyanosis, and abnormalities of heart rhythm, although if mild it may be asymptomatic. If mild, life expectancy is normal. If severe, corrective surgery may be necessary. \[W. Ebstein (1836-1912), German physician]
