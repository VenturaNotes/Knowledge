- A helical scan magnetic-tape system originally designed for audio recording, but adapted for computer use (e.g. in backup systems) using the DSS (digital data storage) format. The cartridge is very compact but the recording method allows a capacity of up to 80 gigabytes, depending on the precise format used.
