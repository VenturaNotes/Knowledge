- $n$. the organ responsible for the production of vocal sounds, also serving as an air passage conveying air from the pharynx to the lungs. It is situated in the front of the neck, above the trachea. It is made up of a framework of nine cartilages (see illustration) $\textendash$ the epiglottis, thyroid, cricoid, arytenoid (two), corniculate (two), and cuneiform (two) $\textendash$ bound together by ligaments and muscles and lined with mucous membrane. Within are a pair of vocal folds, which function in the production of voice. $\textemdash$laryngeal adj.

## Source[^2]
- (pl. larynges) The anterior portion of the trachea (windpipe) of tetrapod vertebrates, which in amphibians, reptiles, and mammals contains the vocal cords. Movement of the cartilage in the walls of the larynx (by means of the laryngeal muscles) alters the tension of the vocal cords. This changes the pitch of the sound emitted by the vocal cords when they vibrate. The final voiced sound is modified by resonance within the oral and nasal cavities.
