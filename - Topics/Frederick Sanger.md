- (1918-2013) British biochemist who worked at Cambridge University and the Medical Research Council. He was awarded two Nobel Prizes for chemistry. The first was for his discovery of the amino-acid sequence in bovine insulin, which enabled insulin to be synthesized. His second Nobel Prize was for discovering the sequence of 5400 nucleotides in a strand of viral DNA. His technique for sequencing nucleotides has been widely applied (see DNA SEQUENCING). The Sanger Institute, Cambridge, was founded in 1992 and named in his honour. It is one of the world's leading genomics research establishments.
