- (photochemotherapy) psoralen + ultraviolet A: the combination of a psoralen (a light-sensitive drug) and exposure to long-wave (315-400 nm) ultraviolet light (UVA). It was used in the East in ancient times, with natural sunlight as the light source, for the treatment of vitiligo. It is now principally used for treating psoriasis; a number of other conditions also respond.
