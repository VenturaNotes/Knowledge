- The removal and thinning of the soil layer due to climatic and physical processes, such as high rainfall, which is greatly accelerated by certain human activities, such as deforestation. Soil erosion can lead to a loss of agricultural land and if unchecked, eventually results in desertification. Careful soil husbandry and appropriate cropping practices are essential to prevent soil erosion. Measures include the planting of shelter belts to reduce wind erosion of soil; terracing and contour ploughing to retain soil on hill slopes; the use of cover crops where otherwise the soil surface would be bare, e.g. between crops; and minimal cultivation to help maintain the network of plant roots that is vital for stabilizing the soil.
