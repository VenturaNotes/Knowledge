- $n$. surgical removal of the pancreas. Total pancreatectomy (Whipple's operation) involves excision of the entire gland and part of the duodenum. In subtotal pancreatectomy most of the gland is removed, usually leaving a small part close to the duodenum. In partial pancreatectomy only a portion of the gland is removed. Such operations are performed to remove tumors or tissue damaged by chronic or relapsing pancreatitis. After total or subtotal pancreatectomy it is necessary to administer pancreatic enzymes with food to aid its digestion and insulin injections to replace that normally secreted by the gland.
