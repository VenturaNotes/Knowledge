- First pass yield (FPY), also known as throughput yield, is a measurement of quality performance in manufacturing. It calculates the percentage of finished products without any defects in the production process. To calculate FPY, manufacturers divide the number of 'good' units (those without any flaws) by the number of units that entered production. The higher the FPY, the better the quality of production.
