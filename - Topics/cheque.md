- A written order by a customer to a bank to pay cash, or to transfer money on deposit to another account. It is convenient but not legally compulsory to use a form provided by the bank for this purpose. Cheques will not normally be honoured by the bank unless the customer has a sufficient credit balance or an agreed overdraft facility. Cheques were once convenient and very widely accepted; but they are not legal tender, and there is no compulsion to accept them. An increasing number of businesses are not accepting cheques as credit and debit cards become more ubiquitous.
