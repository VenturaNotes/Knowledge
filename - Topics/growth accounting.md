- A method used to determine the contribution of each factor of production to the growth of output. Any growth unexplained by factor growth is viewed as attributable to technical progress. Consider the production function $Y=F(A, K, L)$, where $Y$ is output, $A$ is the level of technical knowledge, $K$ is the quantity of capital employed, and $L$ is the quantity of labour employed. Each of the variables is a function of time, $t$, so$$Y(t)=F(A(t), K(t), L(t))$$Differentiation with respect to time gives$$\frac{d Y}{d t}=F_{A} \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}+F_{K} \frac{\partial K}{\partial t}+F_{L} \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}$$When the markets for factors are competitive the marginal products are equal to factor rewards, so $F_{K}=r$, the interest rate, and $F_{L}=w$, the wage rate. Hence$$\frac{d Y}{d t}=F_{A} \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}+r \frac{\partial K}{\partial t}+w \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}=F_{A} \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}+r K \frac{1}{K} \frac{\partial K}{\partial t}+w L \frac{1}{L} \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}.$$Dividing the time derivative of output by $Y$ yields$$\frac{1}{Y} \frac{d Y}{d t}=\frac{r K}{Y} \frac{1}{K} \frac{\partial K}{\partial t}+\frac{w L}{Y} \frac{1}{L} \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}+\frac{F_{A}}{Y} \frac{\partial A}{\partial t}$$Now define the growth rates of output, capital, and labour by$$g_{Y}=\frac{1}{Y} \frac{\partial Y}{\partial t}, g_{K}=\frac{1}{K} \frac{\partial K}{\partial t}, \text { and } \quad g_{L}=\frac{1}{L} \frac{\partial L}{\partial t}$$to give$$g_{Y}=\alpha_{K} g_{K}+\alpha_{L} g_{L}+S R$$where $\alpha_{K}=r K / Y$ is the share of capital in national income, $\alpha_{L}=w L / Y$ is the share of labour in national income, and $S R$ is the Solow residual. The Solow residual is the part of growth that cannot be attributed to growth in the stock of capital or labour. This can be interpreted as the underlying growth in productivity due to technical progress.
