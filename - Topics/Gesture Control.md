- Gesture control is the ability to identify and interpret what different body movements mean. Touchless interactions involving computer interpretations of movements are paired with algorithms to achieve desired outcomes. Aspects of this technology can include motion sensor fusion, eye-tracking, and voice recognition. Gesture technology components often have optical sensors that detect signals. Information about these signals is then sent to a processor that converts it into usable information.
