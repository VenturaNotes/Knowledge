## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- a series of enzymes and proteins in living cells through which electrons are transferred, via a series of oxidation-reduction reactions. This ultimately leads to the conversion of chemical energy into a readily usable and storable form. The most important electron transport chain is the respiratory chain, present in mitochondria and functioning in cellular respiration.
## Source[^2]
- (ETC; electron transport system) A series of molecules that transfers electrons via a sequence of biochemical reduction-oxidation (redox) reactions to effect a stepwise change in free energy. An electron transport chain, also known as a respiratory chain, forms the final stage of cellular respiration. The components of this chain are located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria and consist of multiprotein complexes (labelled I to IV) with tightly bound prosthetic groups (cofactors and coenzymes) essential to catalysing the reactions of the chain. Each component is present in multiple copies in a single mitochondrion. NADH or $\mathrm{FADH}_{2}$, generated by the Krebs cycle, transfer their electrons through a chain of electron carrier molecules, including iron-sulphur proteins, ubiquinone (Q), and a series of cytochromes (cyt), that undergo reversible redox reactions, accepting electrons and then donating them to the next carrier in the chain$\textemdash$a process known as electron flow. Cytochrome oxidase combines electrons and hydrogen ions with oxygen$\textemdash$the final electron acceptor in the chain$\textemdash$to form water (see illustration). This process is coupled to the formation of ATP by the chemiosmotic mechanism (see also OXIDATIVE PHOSPHORYLATION). An electron transport chain also occurs in the thylakoid membranes of chloroplasts in photosynthesis; the carrier molecules include plastoquinone, plastocyanin, and ferredoxin. See photOPHOSPHORYLATION.
