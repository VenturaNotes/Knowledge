- A description of some concepts and their relationships, for the purpose of defining the ideas sufficiently to allow a computer to represent them and reason about them. Thus an agent's ontology specifies the basic building blocks of knowledge that defines what it can perceive and reason about. This is a kind of model and, as such, is very useful to define what agents or learning programs can know and what they can communicate. Ontologies are usually compiled for a particular 'domain', e.g. the domains of wind engineering, medical diagnosis, or office interior navigation, but they are more formal than domain knowledge.
## Source[^2]
- A specification of the assumptions, terms, or concepts underlying a particular field of knowledge. For example, the Gene Ontology Consortium is an international collaboration between various databases in the field of genomics to standardize terminology used by researchers. It has developed three ontologies, each containing a controlled vocabulary for naming, respectively, cellular components, biological processes, and molecular functions. Standardization of terms in this way is vital for efficient searching of databases, particularly for devising and using automated search programs.

- $n$. The branch of metaphysics devoted to the study of the nature of being or existence or the essence of things, including the distinction between reality and appearance and whether mathematical entities exist outside of people's minds. \[From Greek on, ontos, the present participle of einai to be + logos word, discourse, or reason]
