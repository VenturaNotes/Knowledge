- The ratio of total earnings for equity in a company to dividends paid out. This is usually above 1 , as some profits are retained, but it is possible for a company which has built up reserves from past profits to pay dividends for periods when the cover from current profits is less than 1, or even negative.

- The number of times a company's dividends to ordinary shareholders could be paid out of its net profits after tax in the same period. For example, a net dividend of $£ 400,000$ paid by a company showing a net profit of $£ 1 \mathrm{M}$ is said to be covered $2 \frac 12$ times. Dividend cover is a measure of the probability that dividend payments will be sustained (low cover might make it difficult to pay the same level of dividends in a bad year's trading) and of a company's commitment to investment and growth (high cover implies that the company retains its earnings for investment in the business). Negative dividend cover is unusual, and may be a sign that a company is in difficulties. In the USA, the dividend cover is expressed as the pay-out ratio, the total dividends paid as a percentage of the net profit. See also PRICE-DIVIDEND RATIO.
