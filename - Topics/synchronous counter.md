- A counter consisting of an interconnected series of flip-flops in which all the flip-flop outputs change state at the same instant, normally on application of a pulse at the counter input. These counters have advantages in speed over asynchronous ripple counters, in which the output must propagate along the chain of flipflops after the application of a pulse at the count input. See also CASCADABLE COUNTER, SHIFT COUNTER.
