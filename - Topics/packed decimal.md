- An economical method of storing decimal digits represented as binary-coded decimals (BCD), using only four bits per digit. Thus two decimal digits may be stored in one byte. This is only slightly less compact than storing a number in binary, and avoids decimal-to-binary conversion. See also CHARACTER ENCODING.
