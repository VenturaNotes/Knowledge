- $n$. A term introduced in 1936 by the German-US psychologist Kurt Lewin (1890-1947) to refer to the psychological field, comprising the person $P$ and the person's environment $E$, jointly determining the person's behavior $B$ at a given moment, this relation being expressed by the equation $B=f(P, E)$, certain regions of the life space having valence and thus being either attractive or repulsive to the person and determining locomotion from one region to another. See also APPROACH-APPROACH CONFLICT, APPROACH-AVOIDANCE CONFLICT, AVOIDANCE-AVOIDANCE CONFLICT, FIELD THEORY, HODOLOGICAL SPACE, LEWINIAN, TOPOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY.
