Releasing adrenalin (epinephrine) or a similar substance; also activated by or responding to adrenalin or a similar substance, this extended usage being widespread but consistently rejected by the English physiologist Sir Henry Hallet Dale (1875-1968), who coined the suffix ergic, and by many other authorities.
