- (greater vestibular glands) a pair of glands that open at the junction of the vagina and the external genitalia (vulva). Their secretions lubricate the vulva and so assist penetration by the penis during coitus. The lesser vestibular glands, around the vaginal opening, perform the same function. \[C. Bartholin (1655-1738), Danish anatomist]
