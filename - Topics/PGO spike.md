- abbrev. Pontogeniculo-occipital spike, a brief high-amplitude EEG wave, representing an alerting response, occurring spontaneously during REM sleep in the pons (where it is believed to originate), in the lateral geniculate nuclei, and in the occipital cortex, elicited in all phases of sleep by sounds or tactile stimuli. It is identical in appearance and probably similar in significance to an eye-movement potential. Also called a PGO wave or pontogeniculo-occipital wave. See also NUCLEUS GIGANTOCELLULARIS. \[From $p$ (ons) + (lateral) $g($eniculate nucleus $)+o($ccipital cortex$)]$
