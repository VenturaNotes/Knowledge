- An economic time series which tends to rise or fall earlier than variables of interest. A series may be a leading indicator either because the activity measured actually changes earlier than the rest of the economy, or because statistics on it are collected more frequently or more promptly, and are processed and published sooner. Leading indicators are useful in economic forecasting.
