- ILM, sometimes referred to as data lifecycle management, is a modern approach to managing ever-transforming data. It uses enterprise policies to determine how data is managed, and as data policies and regulations change, so does the way the data is treated. ILM can determine when data is archived, deleted, utilized, analyzed and what sort of storage requirements will keep the particular type of data compliant with corporate, government, and industry requirements.
