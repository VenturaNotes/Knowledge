## Source [^1]
- An electronic oscillator that consists of two resistor-capacitor amplifier stages that interact in such a way that the amplifier's outputs are complementary and exhibit two stable mutually exclusive states, i.e. fully on and fully off. The circuit can be made to oscillate continuously, producing a square wave (astable mode), produce single pulses (monostable mode), or change state on application of an external trigger (bistable mode). See also FLIP-FLOP.
