- (tsutsugamushi disease) a disease, widely distributed in SE Asia, caused by the parasitic bacterium Rickettsia tsutsugamushi and transmitted to humans through the bite of mites. Only larval mites of the genus Trombicula are involved as vectors. Symptoms include headache, chills, high temperature $\left(104^{\circ} \mathrm{F}\right)$, a red rash over most of the body, a cough, and delirium. A small ulcer forms at the site of the bite. Scrub typhus is treated with tetracycline and other broad-spectrum antibiotics. See also RICKETTSIAE; TYPHUS.
