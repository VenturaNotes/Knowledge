- A fruit fly (Drosophila sp.) with three instead of the normal two X chromosomes. In such flies the disproportion of sex chromosomes to autosomes leads to impaired development and often failure to emerge from the pupae. Human females with the 47XXX karyotype have generally normal sexual development and are fertile, although there is an increased risk of learning difficulties and developmental delay. Compare METAMALE.
