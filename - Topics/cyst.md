- (1) an abnormal sac or closed cavity lined with epithelium and filled with liquid or semisolid matter. There are many varieties of cysts occurring in different parts of the body. Retention cysts arise when the outlet of a glandular duct is blocked, as in sebaceous cysts. Some cysts are congenital, due to abnormal embryonic development; for example, dermoid cysts. Others are tumors containing cells that secrete mucus or other substances, and another type of cyst is formed by parasites in the body (see HYDATID). Cysts may occur in the jaws: a periapical cyst occurs at the apex of a tooth, a dentigerous cyst occurs around the crown of an unerupted tooth, and an eruption cyst forms over an erupting tooth. See also FIMBRIAL CYST; OVARIAN CYST; PSEUDOCYST. 
- (2) a dormant stage produced during the life cycle of certain protozoan parasites of the alimentary canal, including Giardia and Entamoeba. Cysts, passed out in the faeces, have tough outer coats that protect the parasites from unfavorable conditions. The parasites emerge from their cysts when they are eaten by a new host. 
- (3) a structure formed by and surrounding the larvae of certain parasitic worms.
