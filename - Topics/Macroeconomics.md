## Source[^2]
- The branch of economics that studies economies as a whole rather than the behavior of particular economic agents. Modern macroeconomics is largely concerned with the relationships between such factors as money supply, employment, interest rates, government spending, investment, and consumption, and with the role that government should play in a national economy. In recent economic thinking the distinction between macroeconomics and microeconomics has become less clear cut than previously.
