## Source[^2]
- The branch of economics that studies economies as a whole rather than the behavior of particular economic agents. Modern macroeconomics is largely concerned with the relationships between such factors as money supply, employment, interest rates, government spending, investment, and consumption, and with the role that government should play in a national economy. In recent economic thinking the distinction between macroeconomics and microeconomics has become less clear cut than previously.
## Source[^3]
- The macro aspects of economics, concerning the determination of aggregate quantities in the economy. Macroeconomics considers what determines total employment and production, consumption, investment in raising productive capacity, and how much a country imports and exports. It also asks what causes booms and slumps in the short run, and what determines the long-term growth rate of the economy, the general level of prices, and the rate of inflation. Macroeconomics considers how these matters can and should be influenced by government through monetary and fiscal policies. It is contrasted with microeconomics, which is concerned with disaggregated quantities, such as the incentives operating on individuals and firms in the economy, the organization of production, and the distribution of incomes. The emphasis on building macroeconomic models on the basis of microeconomic foundations has led to an amalgamation of the two in many instances. See also MACROECONOMIC POLICY.
