- In standard costing, the variance arising when the standard cost of the actual production is compared with the actual cost incurred. If the standard cost is higher than the actual cost a favorable variance arises, while if the actual cost exceeds the standard cost an adverse variance occurs. The production cost variance is usually analyzed into the direct materials variances, the direct labour variances, and the fixed and variable overhead variances, each of which can be further analyzed within such parameters as expenditure and efficiency. See ANALYSIS OF VARIANCE.
