- Natural or man-made resources that are replenishable at least as fast as they are consumed or used up. Natural resources such as fresh water or timber may become non-renewable if used up at a faster rate than they are replenished by natural processes, unlike solar or tidal energy. Examples of man-made renewable resources include food, paper, and leather. See also DEPLETABLE RESOURCES.
