- Glands in many terrestrial animals that secrete saliva into the mouth. In humans there are three pairs: the sublingual, submandibular, and the submaxillary glands. The salivary gland cells of some insect larvae produce giant chromosomes (see POLYTENY), which are widely used in the study of genetics and protein synthesis.
