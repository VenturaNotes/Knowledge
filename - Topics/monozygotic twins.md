- $n$. Twins that are monozygotic, being formed when a single ovum or egg is fertilized by a single spermatozoon and then splits and develops into two separate individuals sharing identical genes. The relative frequency of monozygotic twins is quite stable at about 1 pair per 250 births. Also called identical twins, but this is avoided in careful scientific usage, because they are never identical, having been influenced by environmental as well as genetic factors. See also twin studies. Compare DIZYGOTIC TWINS.
