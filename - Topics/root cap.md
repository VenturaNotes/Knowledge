- (calyptra) A cone-shaped structure that covers the root tip and develops as a result of cell division by a meristem at the root apex (see CALYPTROGEN). It protects the root tip as it grows between the soil particles. The cells are constantly worn away by friction and are replaced by the meristem. See also MUCIGEL.
