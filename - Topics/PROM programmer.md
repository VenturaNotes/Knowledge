- (programmer unit) An item of equipment that establishes the correct conditions for the programming of a PROM device and thus allows the user to program the PROM. The programming process often requires the physical destruction of fusible links within the PROM using relatively high voltage pulses, hence the jargon terms PROM zapping, blowing, blasting, and burning. Such equipment may be capable of programming a number of different types of PROM and/or EPROM devices.
