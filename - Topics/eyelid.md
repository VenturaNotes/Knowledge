- $n$. the protective covering of the eye. Each eye has two eyelids consisting of skin, muscle, connective tissue (tarsus), and sebaceous glands (meibomian or tarsal glands). Each eyelid is lined with membrane (conjunctiva) and fringed with eyelashes. Stimulation of the pain receptors in the cornea causes the eyelids to close in a reflex action. Inflammation of a meibomian gland can result in a chalazion. Anatomical names: blepharon, palpebra.
