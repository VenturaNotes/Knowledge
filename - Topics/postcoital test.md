- a test used in the investigation of infertility. A specimen of cervical mucus, taken 6-24 hours after coitus, is examined under a microscope. The appearance of 10 or more progressively motile spermatozoa per high-power field in the specimen indicates that there is no abnormal reaction between spermatozoa and mucus. The test should be undertaken in the postovulatory phase of the menstrual cycle.
