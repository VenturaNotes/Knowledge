## Source [^1]
- One of a class of storage devices in which physical records are addressable and can therefore be accessed in any order: a sequential search is not required. For all practical purposes direct-access storage is synonymous with disk storage.
## Source[^2]
- A direct access storage device (DASD) refers to disk drive accessories. Specifically, these disk drives can be easily accessed at any point. A user should be able to use a DASD to find whatever information they want or need. This information should be accessible at any time, and each block of data on a DASD is assigned to a unique address that allows for the data to be found and accessed. A DASD is usually an attached disk drive, such as a flash drive or another removable form of storage.
