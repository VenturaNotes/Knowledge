- The secretion by plants of chemicals, such as phenolic and terpenoid compounds, that inhibit the growth or germination of other plants, with which they are competing. For example, the aromatic oils released by certain shrubs of the Californian chaparral pass into the soil and inhibit the growth of herbaceous species nearby. Some plants produce chemicals that are toxic to grazing herbivorous animals.
