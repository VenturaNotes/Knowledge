## Source[^2]
- $n$. The act or process of forming ideas (1) or mental images of things not at the time being experienced through sensation; a collective term for all phenomena associated with ideas. The word was introduced in 1829 by the Scottish philosopher James Mill (1773-1836) in his book Analysis of the Phenomena of the Human Mind (Vol. 1): 'We have not a name for that complex notion which embraces, as one whole, all the different phenomena to which the term Idea relates. As we say Sensation, we might also say Ideation; it would be a very useful word; and there is no objection to it, except for the pedantic habit of decrying a new term. Sensation would in that case be the general name for one part of our constitution, Ideation for another' (p. 42). ideate $v b$. To form ideas. 
- ideational adj. Of or relating to the formation of ideas. ideationally adv. Through or by means of ideation. \[From Latin idea a general or ideal form, type, or model, from Greek idein to see + -ation indicating a process or condition]
