- An iframe (short for inline frame) is an hypertext markup language (HTML) is a web application framework that allows developers to insert one HTML document into another. In the web development industry, iframes are often used to embed multimedia content, advertisements, and social media posts into a webpage. Iframes can be inserted anywhere in a web page layout and run without requiring a website user to reload the web page. Advertisers often use iframes to efficiently place advertisement videos on popular web pages to catch the attention of their target audience.
