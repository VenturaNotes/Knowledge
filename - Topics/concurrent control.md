- (real-time control) An approach to controlling the performance of an operating system that attempts to bring together the monitoring of performance, comparison with parameters, and taking action stages. Thus in total quality management members of staff take responsibility for the quality of every stage of a process as they are performing it, in contrast to a feedback control system, in which the quality would not be inspected until the process had been completed. In some specialist environments the use of electronic data-capture has enabled the feedback cycle to become very short. Processes can be adjusted within milliseconds, thus minimizing any cost penalties. See also FEEDFORWARD CONTROL.
