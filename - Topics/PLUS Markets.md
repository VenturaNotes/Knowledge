- A stock exchange in London for shares in smaller companies: it developed from the Ofex trading facility in 2005-06 and by 2007 had become a serious rival to the London Stock Exchange's Alternative Investment Market. It became a UK Recognized Investment Exchange in 2007. However, trading losses in the years after 2008 led to its sale to the inter-dealer broker ICAP in 2012.
