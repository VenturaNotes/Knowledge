- (1) A rule of evidence by which a person is prevented from denying that a certain state of affairs exists, having previously asserted that it does. 
- (2) (promissory estoppel) The rule that if a person has declared that the strict legal rights under a contract will not be insisted upon, they cannot be insisted upon later if the other party has relied on that declaration. The strict legal rights may, however, be enforced on giving reasonable notice, if this would not be inequitable. 
- (3) (proprietary estoppel) The rule that if one person allows or encourages another person to act to his or her detriment in respect of land, he or she will not later be able to refuse to grant something that he or she allowed the other person to expect. For example, if A encourages B to build a garage, which can only be reached by driving over A's land, saying that a right of way will be granted, A will not later be able to refuse to do so.
