- A block matrix such as $$\begin {bmatrix} \lambda & 1 & 0 \\0 & \lambda & 1\\ 0 & 0 & \lambda \end{bmatrix}$$and more generally an $n \times n$ matrix with entries of $\lambda$ on the diagonal, entries of 1 just above the diagonal, and 0 entries elsewhere. Often denoted $J(\lambda, n)$. The characteristic polynomial and minimal polynomial of $J(\lambda, n)$ both equal ($x - \lambda)^n$.
