- (arithmetic average) An average obtained by adding together the individual numbers concerned and dividing the total by their number. For example, the arithmetic mean of $7,20,107$, and $350$ is $484 / 4=121$. This value, however, gives no idea of the spread of numbers and may prove misleading where there are a small number of extreme values. Compare GEOMETRIC MEAN; MEDIAN; WEIGHTED AVERAGE. See also NORMAL DISTRIBUTION.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. In descriptive statistics, the average value, calculated (for a finite set of scores) by adding the scores together and then dividing the total by the number of scores. Often referred to simply as the mean, this is the most commonly used measure of central tendency. See also Lake Wobegon effect, median, mode, trimmed mean. Compare geometric mean, harmonic mean. M abbrev. \[From Old French moien, from Latin medianus median]
