- (arithmetic average) An average obtained by adding together the individual numbers concerned and dividing the total by their number. For example, the arithmetic mean of $7,20,107$, and $350$ is $484 / 4=121$. This value, however, gives no idea of the spread of numbers and may prove misleading where there are a small number of extreme values. Compare GEOMETRIC MEAN; MEDIAN; WEIGHTED AVERAGE. See also NORMAL DISTRIBUTION.
