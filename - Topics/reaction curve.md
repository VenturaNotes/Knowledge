- The optimal strategy of one player in a game expressed as a function of the strategy choices of other players. For example, in Cournot competition the reaction curve of one firm describes the profit-maximizing output as a function of the output level of the other firms. A Nash equilibrium occurs where the reaction curves of the players intersect, so their choices are mutually consistent.
