## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Coal, oil, and natural gas, the fuels used by humans as a source of energy. They are formed from the remains of living organisms and all have a high carbon or hydrogen content. Their value as fuels relies on the exothermic oxidation of carbon to form carbon dioxide $\left(\mathrm{C}+\mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{CO}_{2}\right)$ and the oxidation of hydrogen to form water $\left(\mathrm{H}_{2}+\frac{1}{2} \mathrm{O}_{2} \rightarrow \mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O}\right)$. Fossil fuels are a major source of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide; hence their use contributes to the greenhouse effect and global warming.
