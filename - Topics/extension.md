- The difference $x\textemdash l$ between the actual length x of a string or spring and its natural length $l$. The extension of a spring is negative when the spring is compressed.

- (1) The part of a file name that indicates the type of file. For example, in the file 'document.txt', the 'txt' is the extension, indicating that the file is a text file. A large number of such standard extensions exist. A list of common examples is given in the Appendices. 
- (2) An add-on program that provides additional features to an existing program (for example, a QuarkXpress extension for indexing). 
- (3) (of a source in coding theory). The process of encoding several symbols at a time, or the results thereof. If the symbols of a q-ary information source are taken $r$ at a time, and the words of length $r$ are treated (e.g. encoded) as if they were themselves symbols of an alphabet of size $q^{r}$, then this compound source is called the $r$th extension of the original source. See also SOURCE CODING THEOREM.
