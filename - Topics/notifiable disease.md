- a disease that must be reported to a proper officer of the local authority so that prompt control and preventive action may be undertaken if necessary. The 'proper officer' duty is often delegated by local authorities to a Consultant in Health Protection within Public Health England. Notifiable diseases in England include anthrax, diphtheria, food poisoning, malaria, measles, rabies, tetanus, tuberculosis, and whooping cough. The list varies for different countries, including the other parts of the United Kingdom. Some diseases are internationally notifiable through the World Health Organization; these include cholera, plague, relapsing fever, typhus, and yellow fever. The appropriate reporting of notifiable diseases is legally required by the Health Protection (Notification) Regulations 2010 (and similar legislation in the other parts of the UK).
