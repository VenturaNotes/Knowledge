- Any of the factors of an organism's environment that consist of other living organisms and together make up the biotic environment. These factors may affect an organism in many ways; for example, as competitors, predators, parasites, prey, or symbionts. In time, the distribution and abundance of the organism will be affected by its interrelationships with the biotic environment. Compare ABIOTIC FACTOR.
