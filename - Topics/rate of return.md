- The annual amount of income from an investment, expressed as a percentage of the original investment. This rate is very important in assessing the relative merits of different investments. It is therefore important to note whether a quoted rate is before or after tax, since with most investments, the after-tax rate of return is most relevant. Also, because some rates are payable more frequently than annually, it may be important, in order to make true comparisons, to consider the annual percentage rate (APR), which most investment institutions are required to state by law. See also RISK-FREE RATE.

- The increase in the value of an asset expressed as a proportion of the asset's initial value over a given time period (the 'holding period'). For example, if a share costs $£ 2.00$ to purchase and a year later is worth $£ 2.10$, the return over the holding period of a year is (2.10- 2.00) / 2.00 = 0.05. A rate of return can be calculated before or after the deduction of tax, and over any length of holding period. See also INTERNAL RATE OF RETURN; REQUIRED RATE OF RETURN.
