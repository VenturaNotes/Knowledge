- (about 476-550) Indian mathematician, author of one of the oldest Indian mathematical texts. Written in verse, the Āryabhatīya is a summary of miscellaneous rules for calculation and mensuration. It deals with, for example, the areas of certain plane figures, values for $\pi$, and the summation of arithmetic series. Also included is the equivalent of a table of sines, based on the half-chord rather than the whole chord of the Greeks.
