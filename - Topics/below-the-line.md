- Items following but not part of the profit-and-loss accounts of firms or the income sections of national income accounts. For firms below-the-line items indicate how profits are used, or how losses are financed. In national income accounts they are capital account transactions. In both cases below-the-line items refer to changes in the form in which assets are held, and not to transactions giving rise to income.

- (1) Denoting entries below the horizontal line on a company's profit and loss account that separates the entries that establish the profit (or loss) from the entries that show how the profit is distributed or where the funds to finance the loss have come from. 
- (2) Denoting advertising expenditure in which no commission is payable to an advertising agency. For example, direct mail, exhibitions, point-of-sale material, and free samples are regarded as below-the-line advertising. 
- (3) Denoting transactions concerned with capital, as opposed to revenue, in national accounts. Compare ABOVE-THE-LINE.
