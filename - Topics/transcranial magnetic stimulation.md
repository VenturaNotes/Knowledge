- (TMS) stimulation of the brain by strong magnetic fields that induce electric currents in the underlying brain tissue. Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS), consisting of a series of TMS pulses, is used to treat depression. Its clinical utility is controversial, with inconsistent research results regarding its efficacy. Although there have been some small studies regarding its use with other conditions, such as OCD, rTMS is not currently used routinely in the treatment for any illness other than depression.
