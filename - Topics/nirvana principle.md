- $n$. In psychoanalysis, the tendency for the quantity of energy in the mental apparatus to reduce to zero. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced the concept in 1920 in his book Beyond the Pleasure Principle (Standard Edition, XVIII, pp. 7-64, at pp. 55-6). In 1924, in an article on 'The Economic Problem in Masochism', he defined it ambiguously as the principle of the mental apparatus 'of extinguishing, or at least of maintaining at as low a level as possible, the quantities of excitation flowing into it' (Standard Edition, XIX, pp. 159-70, at pp. 159-60). The term itself, which Freud attributed to the British psychoanalyst Barbara Low (1877-1955), relates to Buddhism and Hinduism, in which nirvana is the longed-for release from the cycle of reincarnation, attained by the extinction of all desires and individual existence. See also bound energy, free energy, Thanatos. Compare principle of constancy. \[From Sanskrit nirvana extinction or a blowing out, from nir- out + vati it blows]
