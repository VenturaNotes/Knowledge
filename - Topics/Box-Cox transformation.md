- A transformation for time-series data of the form$$x_{t}=\frac{y_{t}^{\lambda}-1}{\lambda}$$where $x_{t}$ is the transformed series, $y_{t}$ is the original series, and $\lambda$ is a number between 0 and 1 . It is often used to stabilize the variance of the time series. $\lambda=0$ corresponds to the logarithmic transformation, and $\lambda=1$ is a mean reduction. The optimal $\lambda$ can be estimated from the data, simultaneously with other parameters in a completely specified time series model for $y_{t}$.
