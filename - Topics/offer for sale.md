- An invitation to the general public to purchase the stock of a company through an intermediary, such as an issuing house or merchant bank (compare OFFER BY PROSPECTUS); it is one of the most frequently used means of flotation. An offer for sale can be in one of two forms: a public issue (the more usual), in which stock is offered at a fixed price and some form of balloting or rationing is required if the demand for the shares exceeds supply; or an issue by tender, in which individuals offer to purchase a fixed quantity of stock at or above some minimum price and the stock is allocated to the highest bidders. Compare INTRODUCTION; PLACING.
