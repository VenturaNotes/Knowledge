- (RAM drive, virtual disk) A portion of a computer's RAM memory made to behave as though it were a disk. It can be written to and read from as though it were a real disk but it is very much faster. However, it will generally have a lower capacity than a hard disk. The contents of the RAM disk are not preserved when the computer is switched off. RAM disks are not widely used: disk caches that improve the performance of real disks are a better use of RAM.
