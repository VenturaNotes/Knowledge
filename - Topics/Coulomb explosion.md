- The sudden disruption of a molecule from which the electrons have been stripped to leave only the nuclei, which repel each other because of their electric charge. The technique of Coulomb explosion imaging uses this effect to investigate the shape of molecules. A beam of high-energy neutral molecules is produced by first adding electrons, accelerating the ions in an electric field, and then removing the electrons. The beam collides with a thin metal foil having a thickness of about 30 atoms. As the molecules pass through this foil their electrons are scattered and only the nuclei of the molecules emerge. The process occurs within a very short period of time, shorter than the time required for a complete molecular vibration, and consequently the nuclei retain the molecular shape until they are suddenly repulsed by the like charges. The nuclei then impinge on a detector that records their velocity and direction, thus enabling the spatial arrangement of the original molecule to be derived.
