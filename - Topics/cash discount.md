- A discount for payment in cash rather than by cheque or credit card. Sellers are willing to offer cash discounts because immediate payment reduces delays in receiving payment, reduces administrative costs, reduces losses through the default involved in credit sales or deferred payment, and makes tax evasion easier.

- A discount receivable or allowable for settling an invoice for cash, or within a specified period. In the profit and loss account, discounts receivable are classed as revenue; discounts allowable as expenditure.
