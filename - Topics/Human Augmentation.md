- Human augmentation means using technology to enhance a person. Another term for human augmentation is Human 2.0. Enhancements can be physical or cognitive. An example of a physical augmentation is a prosthetic arm that works “better” in some ways than biological human arms. Currently, there are finger prosthetics that mimic human dexterity extremely well, improving the quality of life for amputees. Another example is a pair of spectacles that restore some vision to the sight-limited, using cameras to create a replica of the user’s "vision."
