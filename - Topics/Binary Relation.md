- A relation defined between two sets.

- It is most natural to think of a binary relation, such as $\leq$, as taking an ordered pair of elements, such as $(3,4)$ or $(6,2)$, and returning true for the former and false for the latter, as $3 \leq 4$ is true and $6 \leq 2$ is false. More formally, a binary relation on a set $S$ is a subset $R$ of the Cartesian product $S \times S$. We then write $a R b$ if $(a, b) \in R$. See EQUIVALENCE RELATION, PARTIAL ORDER.
