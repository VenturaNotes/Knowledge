- Three-schema architecture is a framework for managing access to data in a database management system (DBMS) that originated in the 1970s. It consists of three layers or schemas: the conceptual or data administration view; the external or programming view; and the internal or database administration view. The principle of three-schema architecture is that the conceptual schema, a map used to graphically represent the structure of information in a database, consists of business rules from a semantic data model (a method of structuring data to present it logically). The conceptual schema makes programs and data structures more independent.
