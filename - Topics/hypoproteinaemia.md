- $n$. a decrease in the quantity of protein in the blood. It may result from malnutrition, impaired protein production (as in liver disease), or increased loss of protein from the body (as in the nephrotic syndrome). It results in swelling (oedema), because of the accumulation of fluid in the tissues, and increased susceptibility to infections. See also HYPOGAMMAGLOBULINAEMIA.
