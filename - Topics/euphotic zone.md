- (epipelagic zone; photic zone) The topmost layer of a lake or sea in which there is sufficient light for net primary production, i.e. where the energy fixed by photosynthesis exceeds that lost by respiration. The depth varies, depending on such factors as turbidity, supply of nutrients in the water, tidal turbulence, and temperature. For example, high nutrient levels will encourage a greater biomass of phytoplankton near the surface, which causes shading and consequent reduction in depth of the euphotic zone. It typically ranges from 1 m to about 30 m in lakes and coastal waters, and rarely reaches depths of more than 200 m in the open ocean. At depths between 200 and 1000 m blue light may still penetrate sufficiently to allow limited photosynthesis. This is sometimes referred to as the dysphotic zone or mesopelagic zone. Below this is the aphotic zone, where no light penetrates.
