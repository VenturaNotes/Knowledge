- $n$. The frequencies of sound waves that a listener can hear as tones (1), between the audibility limits of the lowest to the highest frequencies that can be perceived. For a person with normal hearing, the range is more than 10 octaves, from 16 hertz to about 20,000 hertz, but for most people the upper audibility limit decreases sharply throughout adulthood. Also called the auditory spectrum. See also frequency theory, GALTON WHISTLE, INFRASOUND, ULTRASOUND.
