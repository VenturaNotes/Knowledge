- A fixed sum of money paid to someone each year, typically for the rest of their life.
## Source[^2]
- A contract by which a financial institution such as an insurance company agrees to provide a regular income for the remainder of the holderâ€™s life. The name annuity arises from annual payments, but the payments can in fact be of any agreed frequency. The recipient will be a named person; it is also possible to contract for full or reduced payments for life to surviving spouses or other dependants. The payments may be either fixed in money terms, or index-linked. Annuities enable the recipients to spend their capital as well as their income without the danger of running out of funds before they die.
## Source[^3]
- (1) A contract in which a person pays a premium to an insurance company, usually in one lump sum, and in return receives periodic payments for an agreed period or for the rest of his or her life. An annuity has been described as the opposite of a life assurance as the policyholder pays the lump sum and the insurer makes the regular payments. Annuities form the basis for private pensions in most developed countries. See also ANNUITY CERTAIN; DEFERRED ANNUITY. 
- (2) A payment made on such a contract.
