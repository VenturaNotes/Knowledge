- A fixed sum of money paid to someone each year, typically for the rest of their life.

## Source[^2]
- A contract by which a financial institution such as an insurance company agrees to provide a regular income for the remainder of the holderâ€™s life. The name annuity arises from annual payments, but the payments can in fact be of any agreed frequency. The recipient will be a named person; it is also possible to contract for full or reduced payments for life to surviving spouses or other dependants. The payments may be either fixed in money terms, or index-linked. Annuities enable the recipients to spend their capital as well as their income without the danger of running out of funds before they die.
