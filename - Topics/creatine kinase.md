- an enzyme involved in the metabolic breakdown of creatine to creatinine. Isomers of creatine kinase originate from brain and thyroid (BB), skeletal muscle (MM), and cardiac muscle (MB). Any damage to these tissues causes an increase of the isomer in the serum, which can be used in diagnosis, particularly of myocardial infarction.
