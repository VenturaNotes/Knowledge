- The contents of a cell apart from the nucleus. It consists of a matrix (see CYTOSOL) in which the cell's organelles are suspended. The cytoplasm may be differentiated into dense outer ectoplasm, which is concerned primarily with cell movement, and less dense endoplasm, which contains most of the cell's structures. The cytoplasm of a prokaryotic cell (i.e. of bacteria or archaea) lacks organelles but nonetheless has distinct functional regions.

- $n$. The protoplasm surrounding the nucleus (1) of a cell. Also called the perikaryon or (now rarely) plasma . See also ectoplasm (1), maternal inheritance, mitochondrial DNA. \[From Greek kytos a vessel + plasma a form]
