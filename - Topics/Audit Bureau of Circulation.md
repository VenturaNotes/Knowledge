- An organization to which most advertising agencies, publishers of newspapers, magazines, and periodicals, and digital service providers belong. Its function is to collect and audit sales figures from publishers regularly and to publish monthly circulation figures; since 1996 it has also taken a leading role in measuring the reach of digital media. This data is of great value to advertisers and institutional investors. A newspaper, magazine, or periodical must have been publishing for a minimum of six months before it is registered with the ABC.
