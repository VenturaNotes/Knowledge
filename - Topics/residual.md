- The difference between a data observation and its corresponding fitted value obtained by regression analysis. The [[residual mean square]] is the sum of squared residuals divided by the appropriate degrees of freedom, and is an estimate of variance of random variation about the fitted model. Plots of residuals against data variables may suggest important modifications to the model. Plots of ranked residuals against percentage points of the normal distribution provide a check on the assumptions used in significance tests in regression analysis. Large residuals identify observations as [[outlier|outliers]], whose exclusion from the analysis will make a large difference to the conclusions.

- In a regression, this is the difference between the observed value of the dependent variable and its value predicted by the estimated regression equation. The residuals from a regression form the basis of many econometric tests.
