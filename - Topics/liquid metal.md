- A metal that is liquid. The only element that is a liquid metal at room temperature is mercury. A difficulty in calculating the properties of liquid metals is that both atoms and electrons are mobile. However, in many cases it is possible to make progress by assuming that the electrons are almost free and that there is short-range structure in the liquid.
