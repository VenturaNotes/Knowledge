- An inverse of a square matrix $A$ is a matrix $X$ such that $AX = I$ and $XA = I$. (A matrix that is not square cannot have an inverse, though it may have a left inverse or a right inverse.) A square matrix A may or may not have an inverse, but if it has then that inverse is unique and A is said to be invertible. A matrix is invertible if and only if it is not singular. Consequently, the term 'non-singular' is sometimes used for 'invertible'.
- When det $A \ne 0$, the matrix (1/det$A$) adj$A$ is the inverse of $A$, where adj$A$ is the adjugate of $A$. For example, the $2\times 2$ matrix A below is invertible if $ad - bc \ne 0$, and its inverse $A^{-1}$ is as shown:$$A = \begin{bmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{bmatrix}, A^{-1}=\frac{1}{ad-bc}\begin{bmatrix}d & -b \\ -c & a\end{bmatrix}$$
