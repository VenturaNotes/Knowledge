- the interface between medicine and psychiatry, recognized by the Royal College of Psychiatrists as a specialty of psychiatry. Liaison teams ideally consist of psychiatric nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists, pharmacists, health-care support workers, and social workers. They are usually located in general hospitals and see patients after deliberate self-harm or when a mental illness or delirium is suspected anywhere in the hospital, in order to diagnose and advise on treatment. They offer psychosocial assessments, treatment plans, medication advice, and advice regarding mental health and capacity legislation, and support ward staff with the management of challenging patients. They also help develop plans for earlier discharges, provide training, and support governance structures.
