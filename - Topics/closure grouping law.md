- $n$. One of the four original grouping laws of Gestalt psychology, formulated in 1923 by the German psychologist Max Wertheimer (1880-1943) to explain the organization of parts into wholes by the visual system. According to the law, elements that are perceived to form a closed contour tend to be grouped together, so that the array `[ ] [ ] [ ] [ ]`tends to be perceived as four rectangular units rather than eight separate elements. See also cloze procedure, common fate, common region, connectedness grouping law, Landolt circle, Pr√§gNanz. Compare good CONTINUATION, PROXIMITY GROUPING LAW, SIMILARITY GROUPING LAW.
