- A function $f : A \to B$ is onto if every element in the codomain B is mapped to by at least one element in the domain A
- Formally:
	- $\forall b \in B, \exists a \in A$ such that $f(a) = b$
- This means the [[range]] of $f$ is equal to the [[codomain]] B
	- #comment It's not saying the range is represented by $f$. It's just saying the range found in $f$ 
- Example
	- $f(x) = x^2$ for $x \in \mathbb{R}$ where $f: \mathbb{R} \to [0, \infty]$
		- Here, the codomain and range are both $[0, \infty]$ 

## Source[^2]
- A function $f: S \to T$ is onto (or surjective) if every element of the codomain T is the image under $f$ of at least one element of the domain $S$. So $f$ is into if the image (or range) $f(S)$ equals the codomain. Compare ONE-TO-ONE

## Source[^3]
- (onto function) A function whose range and codomain coincide. If$$f: X \rightarrow Y$$is a surjection then for each $y$ in the codomain $Y$ there is some $x$ in $X$ with the property that$$y=f(x)$$A function that is not surjective is sometimes said to be into.
