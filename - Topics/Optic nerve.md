- A sensory nerve responsible for transmitting information about vision to the brain
## Source[^2]
- the second cranial nerve (II), which is responsible for vision. Each nerve contains about one million fibres that receive information from the rod and cone cells of the retina. It passes into the skull behind the eyeball to reach the optic chiasm, after which the visual (or optic) pathway continues to the cortex of the occipital lobe of the brain on each side (see illustration).
