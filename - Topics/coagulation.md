- The process in which colloidal particles come together irreversibly to form larger masses. Coagulation can be brought about by adding ions to change the ionic strength of the solution and thus destabilize the colloid ( see FLOCCULATION). Ions with a high charge are particularly effective (e.g. alum, containing Al$^{3+}$, is used in styptics to coagulate blood). Alum and iron(III) sulphate are also used for coagulation in sewage treatment. Heating is another way of coagulating certain colloids (e.g. boiling an egg coagulates the albumin). See also BLOOD CLOTTING.

- $n$. the process by which a colloidal liquid changes to a jellylike mass. See BLOOD COAGULATION.
