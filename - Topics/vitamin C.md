- (ascorbic acid) a water-soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties that is essential in maintaining healthy connective tissues and the integrity of cell walls. It is necessary for the synthesis of collagen. A deficiency of vitamin C leads to scurvy. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is $30 ~\mathrm{mg} /$day; rich sources are citrus fruits and vegetables (the main source of the vitamin in the British diet is potatoes). There is no strong evidence that high intakes of vitamin C reduce the incidence of colds.
