## Source [^1]
- (ascorbic acid) a water-soluble vitamin with antioxidant properties that is essential in maintaining healthy connective tissues and the integrity of cell walls. It is necessary for the synthesis of collagen. A deficiency of vitamin C leads to scurvy. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is $30 ~\mathrm{mg} /$day; rich sources are citrus fruits and vegetables (the main source of the vitamin in the British diet is potatoes). There is no strong evidence that high intakes of vitamin C reduce the incidence of colds.
## Source[^2]
- (ascorbic acid) A colorless crystalline water-soluble vitamin found especially in citrus fruits and green vegetables. Most organisms synthesize it from glucose, but humans and other primates and various other species must obtain it from their diet. It functions as a scavenger of free radicals within cells and in extracellular fluid and blood plasma, and is needed for the synthesis of collagen, a protein found in tendons, skin, and other connective tissues. Deficiency leads to scurvy and delayed wound healing. Vitamin C is readily destroyed by heat and light.
