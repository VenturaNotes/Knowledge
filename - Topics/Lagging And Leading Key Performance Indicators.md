- Lagging and leading key performance indicators allow businesses to understand or anticipate how performance—particularly financial performance—may change. This change may happen in response to some sort of trend or as part of doing business. Leading key performance indicators will refer to how performance may change in the future, while lagging indicators explain current performance.
