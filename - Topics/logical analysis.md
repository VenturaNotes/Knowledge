## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. In logic, the process of combining short sentences into longer sentences and then finding other sentences that mean the same as the sentences built up in this way. It is an activity somewhere between translating and paraphrasing, and it can be performed quite mechanically, according to strict rules. Some logicians believe that it uncovers the true underlying forms of the sentences that they analyse, whereas others believe that it is part of an enterprise to replace natural languages such as English with a new and more rational language. See also propositional CALCULus, TRUTH TABLE.
