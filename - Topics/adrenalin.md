- $n$. A biogenic amine and hormone belonging to the group of catecholamines, also functioning as a neurotransmitter, synthesized from tyrosine in the presence of the cofactor vitamin C and secreted by the chromaffin cells of the adrenal medulla and by nerve fibres in the sympathetic nervous system, causing an increase in blood pressure, accelerated heart rate, deepened respiration, sweating, dilation of the pupils, release of sugar from stores in the liver, diversion of blood from the intestines to the skeletal muscles, closure of the sphincter of the bladder leading to retention of urine, and other physiological reactions typical of fear, anxiety, or stress (1). Formula: $(\mathrm{HO})_{2} \mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{CH}_{2} \mathrm{NHCH}_{3}$. Also spelt adrenaline. Also called epinephrine, especially in the US. See also adrenergic, fight-or-flight response, SYMPATHin. Compare NORADRENALIN. \[From the Latin ad at + renes kidneys $+-i n(a)$ indicating an organic or chemical substance]
