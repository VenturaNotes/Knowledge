- $n$. wire used as a guide to insert a catheter during interventional procedures, particularly in the Seldinger technique. Guidewires often have multiple cores and a variety of coverings, depending on their functions, and they vary in stiffness and thickness. Their ends may be curved, to get past tight strictures, or J-shaped, to avoid accidentally puncturing a vessel wall or other structure while being pushed forward.
