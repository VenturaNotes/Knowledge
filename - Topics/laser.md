## Source [^1]
- A light source with special properties (principally spectral purity, narrow output beam, and ease of modulation) that make it particularly useful in optical storage devices and some kinds of printer, and also in fibre optics communication systems.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation: a laser is a device that emits light through such a process; it can be used to operate on small areas of abnormality without damaging the delicate surrounding tissues. For example, lasers are used to unblock coronary arteries narrowed by atheroma and to remove certain types of birthmark (see NAEVUS). In ophthalmology different types of laser are used for operations on the cornea (see EXCIMER LASER), lens (see FEMTOSECOND LASER), lens capsule (see YAG LASER), and retina (see ARGON LASER; DIODE LASER) and for glaucoma (see TRABECULOPLASTY). Lasers are also used in the treatment of endometrial ablation and large fibroids (the Nd:YAG laser), cervical intraepithelial neoplasia, and varicose veins (endovenous laser treatment).
