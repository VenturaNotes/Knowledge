- The argument that externalities can be corrected by the market. Formally, the theorem states that in a competitive economy with symmetric information and zero transaction costs, the allocation of resources will be efficient and invariant with respect to legal rules of entitlement, or property rights. The implication of the theorem is that there is no need for policy intervention with regard to externalities except to ensure that property rights are clearly defined and protected. Bargaining and negotiation will then ensure an efficient allocation given the allocation of property rights.

- In economic theory, an idea often invoked in discussions of transaction costs, externalities, and government regulation. Simply stated, the theorem holds that in an ideal world with clearly defined property rights, perfect competition, and minimal transaction costs, private bargaining could be relied upon to produce an efficient outcome (i.e. one that maximizes social wealth) in any situation. The implication is that social costs (such as pollution) could be minimized by reducing, rather than increasing, external regulation. The theorem, which derives from the work of the economist Ronald Coase (1910-2013), remains highly controversial.
