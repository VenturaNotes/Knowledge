- 1. from one set $X$ to another set $Y$. A relation $R$ defined on the Cartesian product $x \times y$ in which for each element $x$ in $X$ there is precisely one element $y$ in $Y$ with the property that $(x, y)$ is a member of $R$. It is then customary to talk about a function $f$, say, and to write

  

$$

f: X \rightarrow Y

$$

  

The unique association between elements $x$ and $y$ is denoted by

  

$$

y=f(x) \text { or } y=f x

$$

  

$X$ is called the domain of $f, Y$ the codomain of $f$. Further, $y$ is the value of $f$ at the point $x$ or the image of $x$ under $f$. We say that $f$ is a mapping or transformation between sets $X$ and $Y$ or that $f$ maps $X$ into $Y$, and that $f$ maps $x$ into $y$. When the domain $X$ is the Cartesian product of $n$ sets then $f$ is a function of $n$ variables. Otherwise it is a function of one variable.

  

Examples of functions are readily obtained from the mathematical equivalents of standard functions and operations typically supplied in programming languages. The usual trigonometric functions $\sin , \cos$, and $\tan$ are functions of one variable. The rule for converting from characters into their integer codes or equivalents is a function.

  

Functions are often represented pictorially as graphs.

Examples include the standard functions such as $\sin (x), \cos (x), \exp (x)$; in addition most languages permit user-defined functions. A function is a 'black box' that can be used without any knowledge or understanding of the detail of its internal working. In some languages a function may have side effects.

- In python, a function is a block of code that performs a task and is defined using `def`, but when it's defined inside a class and takes `self` as the first parameter, it becomes a `method`
	- #question Is this true? I just thought all blocks that perform a task are called methods in Python? So functions are all methods not in a class without `self`?
	- #question Do all classes need the `self` handle in the first parameter?

- A section or department of an organization that carries out a discrete activity, under the control of a manager or director. It is the section of the business for which functional budgets are produced. Examples of separate functions are production, sales, finance, and personnel.
