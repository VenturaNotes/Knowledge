- $n$. In statistics, a test used with scores measured on an ordinal scale, or with data converted to ranks, to determine whether several independent samples are from populations with the same median. It is a non-parametric equivalent of one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Also called Kruskal-Wallis 1-way ANOVA. \[Named after the US statisticians William Henry Kruskal (1919-2005) and Wilson Allen Wallis (1912-98) who developed it in 1952]
