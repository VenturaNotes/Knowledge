- A commission set up by the UK government in 2010 under the chairmanship of Sir John Vickers: its report (the Vickers Report) recommended the ring-fencing of mass-market retail banking to insulate it from the risks involved in wholesale and investment banking by the same institutions. Legislation has since been proposed to enforce the separation of retail from investment banking in the UK, with banks being given a deadline of 2019 to comply. The commission's other recommendations, which have been largely adopted by government, include higher capital ratios and measures to encourage greater competition.
