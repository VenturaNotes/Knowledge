- A profit margin, also referenced as a net margin, is the percentage of product or service sales that has been converted to company profits. In other words, a business' profit margin is how many cents on the dollar they make for every dollar they earn.
- For example, if a company claims to have a 48% profit margin last quarter, it actually means that it earned a net income of $0.48 for every dollar accrued from company sales. Companies use their profit margin to gauge how well they are handling their finances.
- That being said, it's important to note that a low profit margin doesn't necessarily mean a business is struggling to turn a profit. It can mean that the company compensates for earning less cents on the dollar by increasing its volume of products or services sold. However, if a company has a low profit margin and doesn't sell many of its offerings, it's unlikely to survive long on the market.
