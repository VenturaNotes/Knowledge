- A currency used to invoice international trade transactions. While the currency of either the buyer or seller is frequently used, in some cases transactions are invoiced in the currency of a third country; this is common where neither party's own currency is widely used. The US dollar and the euro are often used as trading, or vehicle, currencies.
