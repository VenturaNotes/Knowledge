- $n$. In the philosophy of science, the property of a hypothesis or theory of being capable of refutation by empirical evidence, with the implication that a hypothesis lacking this property does not belong to science. The concept was introduced by the Austrian-born British philosopher Karl R(aimund) Popper (1902-94) as a solution to the problem of induction (1) and as a criterion of demarcation between science, which deals with falsifiable hypotheses, and metaphysics, which admits unfalsifiable propositions. See also CONFIRMATION BIAS, HYPOTHETICO-DEDUCTIVE METHOD. Compare LOGICAL EMPIRICISM, LOGICAL POSITIVISM.
