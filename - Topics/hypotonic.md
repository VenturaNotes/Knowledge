- adj. 
- (1) Of or relating to muscles that are abnormally flaccid. Compare HYPERTONIC (1), ISOTONIC (1). 
- (2) Of or relating to a solution having a lower concentration than another and hence exerting less osmotic pressure than the other. A hypotonic saline solution (less than 0.9 per cent) is less concentrated than the intracellular fluid, so that cells expand when immersed in it. See also osmosis. Compare hypertonic (2), isotonic (2). \[From Greek hypo under + tonos tension + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
