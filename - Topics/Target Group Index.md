- (TGI) An annual marketing research report compiled from the returned questionnaires of a random sample of thousands of respondents on their use of hundreds of products and thousands of brands. The questionnaires, which are completed with no interviewer present, also collect information on respondents' demographics, attitudes and values, leisure activities, and exposure to the media. TGI was originated in the UK in 1969 but is now operated in over 60 countries.
