- $n$. inward curvature of the spine, which appears as a forward curvature when viewed from the side. A certain degree of lordosis is normal in the lumbar and cervical regions of the spine: loss of this may occur in ankylosing spondylitis. Exaggerated lordosis may occur through faulty posture or as a result of disorders of vertebral development and spinal muscles. Compare KYPHOSIS.
