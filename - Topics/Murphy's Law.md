- From a technological and business perspective, Murphy's Law is more of a method of anticipating and discussing various types of technical problems that could occur during a device or solution's lifecycle than an actual law. The adjage states that “Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong (and at the worst possible time).”
- In a technical context, Murphyʻs Law is highly relevant to the process of testing software and hardware solutions. Murphyʻs Law suggests that during the testing process, testing equipment will have faults, testers will fail to follow procedure, or run into other types of issues.
