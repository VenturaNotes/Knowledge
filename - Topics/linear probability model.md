- A discrete choice model in which the regression function is assumed to be linear. The major shortcoming of this model is that the linear functional form does not guarantee that the predicted values of the dependent variable, which have interpretation of probabilities, take values between 0 and 1 . Frequently used alternative specifications are the logit model and the probit model.
