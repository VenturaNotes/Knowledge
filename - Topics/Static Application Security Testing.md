- Static application security testing (SAST; aka white box testing) is a methodology that analyzes source code, byte code, and binaries for security vulnerabilities. It does this by identifying coding and design conditions that might be a security risk. SAST tools analyze applications before developers compile code, resolving any security-related issues before the next testing stage. These tools can even analyze code in non-working applications.
