- (endemic haemoptysis) $n$. a tropical disease that occurs principally in Asia, caused by the presence of the fluke Paragonimus westermani in the lungs or other organs. The infection is acquired by eating inadequately cooked shellfish. Early symptoms include fever, cough, chest pain, fatigue, and sweating. Later symptoms vary depending on which organs are affected: in the case of the lungs, symptoms resemble those of tuberculosis. Paragonimiasis is treated with praziquantel.
