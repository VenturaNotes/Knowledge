- (Sure Start Children's Center) a building housing a range of services to support children up to five years of age and their families, including childcare, early education, parenting advice, and access to health advice. Over 3000 'Sure Start'-branded Children's Centres were established under Labour governments from 1997 to 2010. Many centres have subsequently closed, with the result that provision is no longer universal across the UK. See also HEALTH INEQUALITIES.
