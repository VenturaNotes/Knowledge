- $n$. an inflammatory process causing thickening and scarring (fibrosis) of the membranous linings (meninges) of the spinal canal. The resulting entrapment of nerve roots may result in weakness, pain, and numbness in the affected area. The condition may result from infection or inflammation of the meninges, surgery, or as a response to the oil-based dyes previously used in myelography. The reaction to myelography is prevented by the current use of water-soluble dyes.
