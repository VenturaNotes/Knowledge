- A benchmark that measures the limiting capacity of a computer system by a combination of an increasing number of transactions from a standardized mix and an increasing number of terminals, until no more transactions or terminals can be added. This is represented for a number of configurations of the computer until the highest capacity is reached. A percentage (typically 70%) of the highest capacity is then taken as the benchmark result.
