- an electronic device that provides a TV image from an Xray source. The X-rays strike a fluorescent screen after passing through the patient, giving off electrons, which are accelerated using an electron lens before striking a second fluorescent screen, which is usually attached to a video camera. The acceleration of the electrons amplifies the signal from the original image, giving a brighter picture, so that the radiation dose can be reduced. Images can be taken from the camera to be observed in real time on a video monitor or, using a brief higher-dose exposure, to provide a more detailed static image (see DIGITAL SPOT IMAGING).
