## Source [^1]
- (EPO) $n$. a hormone secreted by certain cells in the kidney in response to a reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues. Erythropoietin increases the rate of red cell production (erythropoiesis) and is the mechanism by which the rate of erythropoiesis is controlled. Genetically engineered forms of the hormone are used for treating certain anaemias (see EPOETIN; ESA).
## Source[^2]
- A hormone that is released from the kidney (and to a lesser extent from the liver) in response to low concentrations of oxygen in the tissues. It speeds up the process of erythropoiesis and is the means by which the rate of red cell production is controlled. It is now prepared using genetically engineered cell cultures and administered therapeutically in cases of kidney failure.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A protein that is secreted by the kidney in response to low levels of oxygen in the blood and that increases the rate of formation of erythrocytes in the blood. Sometimes injected by competitive cyclists and other athletes as a virtually undetectable performance enhancer that allows more oxygen to be transported to the muscles, thereby raising the level of aerobic energy production. EPO abbrev. \[From Greek erythro(s) red + poiet(ikos) capable of making, from poiein to make + -itikos resembling or marked by + -$i n(e)$ indicating an organic compound]
