- (EPO) $n$. a hormone secreted by certain cells in the kidney in response to a reduction in the amount of oxygen reaching the tissues. Erythropoietin increases the rate of red cell production (erythropoiesis) and is the mechanism by which the rate of erythropoiesis is controlled. Genetically engineered forms of the hormone are used for treating certain anaemias (see EPOETIN; ESA).
