- (heel-prick blood test) a blood test performed on all newborn babies at the end of the first week of life. The blood is obtained by pricking the heel of the baby. The test can detect several inborn errors of metabolism (including phenylketonuria) and hypothyroidism; it can also be used for detecting cystic fibrosis, although this is not routinely offered. \[R. Guthrie (1916-95), US paediatrician]
