- Ryzen, also referred to as AMD Ryzen, is a brand of multi-core x86 central processing units (CPUs) designed by Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Ryzen was created as a direct competitor of the Intel Core i3, Core i5, and Core i7 processors, which were designed for high-end gaming, video editing, broadcasting, and general productivity purposes.
- AMDâ€™s Ryzen architecture brought a wide range of new processors to the market, including Ryzen 3 - 9 and Threadripper. Each processor is named by its model number. The higher the model number, the more powerful its CPU. AMD Ryzen is commonly used to power business workstations that are heavily used, given its memory encryption capabilities and powerful CPU performance.
