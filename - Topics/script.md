- (1) (command file) A file containing commands or other actions that could have been entered from the keyboard. This is a useful way of replaying often-used sequences of actions. In fact the scripting languages usually have extra commands (not available for direct use) such as branches, loops, and procedure calls. There are also usually optional parameters that allow the script to be made more general. 
- (2) See SCRIPT THEORY.
## Source[^2]
- A script is a list of commands carried out by a specific program or scripting engine, rather than by the computer processor. An example of a server-side scripting language would be Python, while an example of a client-side scripting language would be Javascript. Scripts are often used to automate processes on local computers or generate web pages on the internet. Scripts are much faster to write and develop than actual computer programs, although they do take longer to run since each instruction within the script is handled by another program rather than the computer processor itself. Most script files can be opened and edited using a basic text editor.
## Source[^3]
- A section of programming code used in web pages to add functionality. The script may run on the web server (server-side script). Commonly, scripts written in Javascript are included in the HTML (see HYPERTEXT) of the web page and are interpreted by the web browser when the page is opened (client-side script).
