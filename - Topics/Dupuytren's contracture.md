- a flexion deformity of the fingers (usually the ring and little fingers) caused by a nodular hypertrophy and contracture of the fascia in the palm. The characteristic sign is a nodule at the distal palmar crease or over the proximal phalanx of the finger. The condition is treated by surgical excision of the contracted and thickened tissue. Dupuytren's contracture may be associated with excessive alcohol consumption, diabetes mellitus, repetitive hand use, or vibratory trauma. \[Baron G. Dupuytren (1777-1835), French surgeon]
