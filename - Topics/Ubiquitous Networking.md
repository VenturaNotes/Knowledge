- Ubiquitous networking, commonly referred to as persuasive networking, is the combination of the wired and wireless technologies that support the communication of computing devices that are embedded in everyday objects. This includes the platforms these devices operate on, the networks that connect them, and the user devices that make use of the available information they contain.
- Ubiquitous networking is an essential element of ubiquitous computing, which is the act of embedding microprocessors into world objects to make them perform useful tasks in a way that minimizes the user's need to interact with computers as they are. An example of ubiquitous computing would be a smart speaker that allows users to listen to audiobooks by voice command.
