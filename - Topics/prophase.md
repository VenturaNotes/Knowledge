- $n$. the first stage of mitosis and of each division of meiosis, in which the chromosomes become visible under the microscope. The first prophase of meiosis occurs in five stages (see LEPTOTENE; ZYGOTENE; PACHYTENE; DIPLOTENE; DIAKINESIS).
## Source[^2]
- The first stage of cell division, during which chromosomes contract and divide along their length (except for the centromeres) into chromatids. In mitosis, the chromosomes remain separate from each other. In the first division of meiosis, homologous chromosomes become paired (see PAIRING). By the end of first prophase the two chromosomes begin to move apart.
