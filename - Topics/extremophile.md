- A bacterium or archaean that thrives under extreme conditions, e.g. at very high or very low temperatures, or in very salty or acidic environments. For example, certain archaea, termed hyperthermophiles, live in hot springs at temperatures near or even above $100^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$. The enzymes of such organisms exhibit great stability and have been extracted for use in laboratory and commercial processes.
