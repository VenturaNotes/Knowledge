- Hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) is an application protocol for information systems that allow users to communicate data via the World Wide Web. HTTP is used to load web pages over the internet using hypertext links. Using HTTP, resources can be exchanged between client devices and servers over the internet.
- With HTTP, client devices send requests to web servers to gain the resources needed to load a specific web page. Next, the web server sends a response back to the client device, fulfilling the requests. These requests and responses share subdocuments that contain data in the form of images, text, and textual layouts. These subdocuments are then configured by a client web browser to display the entirety of a web page file on the clientâ€™s device.
