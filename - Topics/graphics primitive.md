- A basic nondivisible graphical element for input or output within a computer-graphics system. Typical output primitives are polyline, polymarker, and fill area. Clipping of an output primitive cannot be guaranteed to produce another output primitive. Output primitives have attributes such as line style and pattern associated with them. Typical input primitives are locator, choice, and valuator. Input primitives often have a style of echoing associated with them.
