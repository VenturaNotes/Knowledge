- The moral quandaries that can occur in running a business. While not confronting the law, most of these dilemmas arise as a result of conflict between what the businessperson sees as necessary in the interests of the business and his or her personal ethical values. These dilemmas may be related to entrepreneurial activities (Does the product or service offered conflict with one's social responsibility?), to one's behavior to competitors (Have the claims for the superiority of one's product or service overstepped the limits of fair competition?), to one's shareholders (Are they earning a fair return on their capital?), and most of all, perhaps, to one's customers (Does the product or service offer fair value for money?).
