- In marketing and communications theory, an acronym for attention, interest, desire, and action. AIDA presents a hierarchy of communication effects often regarded as a useful guideline in creating an advertisement or making a sale. The potential customer should be led from his or her initial awareness, through stages of heightened interest and desire, to the point of action (i.e. making a purchase). A fifth stage, satisfaction, is sometimes added creating the acronym AIDAS.
