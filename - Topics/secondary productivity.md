- The rate of biomass formation or energy fixation by heterotrophic organisms, such as grazers and decomposers (see HETEROTROPHIC NUTRITION). These derive all their energy from photosynthetic plants and other autotrophs, either directly or indirectly, and their productivity determines the number of trophic levels and the lengths of the food chains within an ecosystem$\textemdash$both of which are likely to be increased by greater secondary productivity. See productivity.
