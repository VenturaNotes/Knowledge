- A control on a graphical user interface that displays a list of items. The user may click on one or more items to select options. The whole list may be displayed in the box (with scroll bars if necessary). Alternatively, in a drop-down list box, only the currently selected item is shown. A small downward pointing arrow on the right edge of the box is clicked to display the full list. See also COMBO BOX.
