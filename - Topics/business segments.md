- Separately identifiable parts of the business operations of a company or group whose activities, assets, and results can be clearly identified. Companies are obliged to disclose in their annual report and accounts certain financial information relating to business segments (see SEGMENTAL REPORTING). Although International Financial Reporting Standard 8, Operating Segments, provides guidance as to what comprises a business segment, many inconsistencies appear in the information provided by companies. Standard setters have recognized that companies are not keen to improve segmental reporting because they fear they could suffer some competitive disadvantage.
