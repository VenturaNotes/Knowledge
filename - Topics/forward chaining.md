- (data-driven processing) A control procedure used in problem solving and rule-based systems. When a data item matches the antecedent part of a rule, then the conditions for that rule have been satisfied and the consequent part of the rule is executed. The process then repeats, usually through some form of conflict-resolution mechanism to prevent the same rules firing continuously. Compare BACKWARD CHAINING.
