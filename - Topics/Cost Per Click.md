- Cost-per-click (CPC) is a metric used when referring to digital advertisements. A business will pay for every time a prospective customer clicks on the ad that is designed and displayed for them. The cost per click is how much that price will be for each click. An organization will pay only when the advertisement is actually "used" or clicked on.
