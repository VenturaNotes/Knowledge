- $n$. Awareness and understanding of factual information about the worldâ€”knowing that in contrast to knowing how. Its necessary and sufficient conditions are that the information must be true, that the person must believe it to be true, and that the person must be in a position to know it. Typical items of declarative knowledge might include: that Princess Diana died in 1997; that Goethe was 83 when he finished writing Faust; that there is a village in Hertfordshire, England, called Ugley. See also ACT, deCLARATIVE MEMORY, KNOWLEDGE. Compare ACQUAINTANCESHIP KNOWLEDGE, NON-DECLARATIVE KNOWLEDGE, PROCEDURAL KNOWLEDGE.
