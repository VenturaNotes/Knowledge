- A group of parasitic fungi of the phylum Basidiomycota. Many of these species attack the leaves and stems of cereal crops: characteristic rust-coloured streaks of spores appear on infected plants. The life cycles of some rusts may be complex; many form a number of different types of spore and some require two different host plants. Compare SMUTS.
