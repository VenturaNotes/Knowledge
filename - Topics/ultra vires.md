- (Latin: beyond the powers) Denoting an act of an official or corporation for which there is no authority. The powers of officials exercising administrative duties and of corporations are limited by the instrument from which their powers are derived. If they act outside these powers, their action may be challenged in the courts. Until recently, a company's powers were limited by the objects clause in its memorandum of association; if it entered into an agreement outside these objects, the agreement could be challenged. The Companies Act 2006 removes the requirement for a company to restrict its objects in this way (unless it is a charitable company).
