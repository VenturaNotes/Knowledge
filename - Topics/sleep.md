- A facility available on modern microcomputers where the machine is made inactive while preserving screen layout, program states, etc. The machine is not turned off (compare HIBERNATE), but its power consumption is reduced. It can quickly be returned to an active state and users can pick up work where they left off. Users might be required to enter their password before they can access the restored system.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a state of natural unconsciousness, during which the brain's activity is not apparent (apart from the continued maintenance of basic bodily functions, such as breathing) but can be detected by means of an electroencephalogram (EEG). Different stages of sleep are recognized by different EEG wave patterns. Drowsiness is marked by short irregular waves; as sleep deepens the waves become slower, larger, and more irregular. This slow-wave sleep is periodically interrupted by episodes of paradoxical, or REM (rapid-eye-movement), sleep, when the EEG pattern is similar to that of an awake and alert person. Dreaming occurs during REM sleep. The two states of sleep alternate in cycles of from 30 to 90 minutes, REM sleep constituting about a quarter of the total sleeping time.
