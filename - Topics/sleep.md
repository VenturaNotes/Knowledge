- A facility available on modern microcomputers where the machine is made inactive while preserving screen layout, program states, etc. The machine is not turned off (compare HIBERNATE), but its power consumption is reduced. It can quickly be returned to an active state and users can pick up work where they left off. Users might be required to enter their password before they can access the restored system.
