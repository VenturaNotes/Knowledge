- (1) A knowledge representation and reasoning formalism originally developed by mathematicians to formalize mathematical reasoning. In mathematical logic the investigation involves mathematical methods taken from algebra or the theory of algorithms. The two most common systems are propositional calculus and predicate calculus.
- Logic has been widely adopted within artificial intelligence, for example as an alternative to production rules in expert systems and for representing the meaning of natural language statements (see NATURAL-LANGUAGE UNDERSTANDING). Many alternative logics have been developed in artificial intelligence to represent the vagueness and uncertainty of common sense (as opposed to mathematical knowledge) and to represent the tentative nature of common-sense reasoning; these include nonmonotonic reasoning and uncertain reasoning (see UNCERTAINTY).

- $n$. The branch of philosophy devoted to the study of valid arguments, or (equivalently) of consistent sets of beliefs, involving the application of rules of inference to draw valid conclusions from sets of premises. An argument is a set of statements purporting to provide a reason for believing a certain statement, and it is valid if its counterexample set is inconsistent. More specifically, a logic is any particular formal system of axioms and rules of inference, or the arrangement of elements in a computer designed to perform a specified computation; and more generally logic is any sound or valid method of argument or reasoning, or rational thinking as distinct from irrationality.
