- A graphical input device that is based on a fixed spherical ball. It inputs six different values defined by the orientation of the ball and the pressure together with the direction that is applied to it. It allows complex objects to be positioned and rotated in three-dimensional space using the single input device. Internally a spaceball is normally made from a set of strain-gauges.
