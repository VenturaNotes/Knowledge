- Actual physical control of goods or land. Possession has a wide variety of meanings in English law, depending on the nature of the property and the circumstances. For example, a person may still have possession of goods that have been lost or mislaid, provided that they are not abandoned and that no-one else has physical possession of them. It is sometimes used in the sense of a right to possession, e.g. the right of a person who has pledged goods to get them back. Possession may be divorced from ownership; for example, a thief has legal possession of stolen goods but not ownership. Possession usually requires intention to possess-a person cannot possess something without knowing that he or she does so.
