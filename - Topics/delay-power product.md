- A figure of merit that is frequently quoted as characteristic of a particular logic family. It is the product of the propagation delay (usually in nanoseconds) and the power dissipation (usually in milliwatts) of a gate typical of the family; it has dimensions of energy, the usual unit being the picojoule, pJ. The smaller the delay-power product is, the better the logic family is considered to be.
