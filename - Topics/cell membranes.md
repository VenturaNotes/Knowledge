## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
- Surround cells separating their internal contents from the external environment
	- Composed of a complex arrangement of [[lipids]], [[proteins]], and [[carbohydrates]]
		- Provides essential function such as [[selective permeability]], [[cellular communication]], [[structural integrity]]
- [[Phospholipids]] are the most abundant lipid molecules in the membrane
	- Consist of hydrophilic head (composed of a phosphate group and glycerol)
		- Faces outward towards surrounding fluid
	- Two hydrophobic fatty acid tails
		- Faces inward
	- Spontaneously organize into a bilayer arrangement
- Proteins
	- Integral membrane proteins traverse the lipid bilayer (allowing to interact with molecules both inside and outside the cell)
		- Can serve as [[transporters]], [[channels]], [[receptors]], [[enzymes]], and structural components.
	- [[Peripheral membrane proteins]] are associated with the surface of the membrane but do not penetrate it.
		- Contribute to membrane stability, cell signaling, and cytoskeleton interactions
- Carbohydrates typically present on outer surface of the cell membrane
	- attached to lipids or proteins forming [[glycolipids]] or [[glycoproteins]] respectively
		- These carbohydrate chains ([[glycocalyx]]) participate in [[cell recognition]], [[adhesion]] and [[signaling events]].
