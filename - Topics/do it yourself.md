- Tasks carried out within a household which could have been performed by a paid specialist. The term covers mainly decorating, home improvements, and motor repairs. DIY stores sell materials for use in such activities. DIY activities are encouraged by the tax system, which requires employed labour to be paid for out of taxed income, whereas family labour is tax-free.
