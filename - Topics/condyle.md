- A smooth round knob of bone that fits into a socket on an adjoining bone, forming a joint. Such a joint permits up-and-down or side-to-side movement but does not allow rotation. There are condyles where the lower jawbone (mandible) is attached to the skull, which permits chewing movements. See also OCCIPITAL CONDYLE.
