- n. 
- (1) (urinary bladder) a sac-shaped organ that has a wall of smooth muscle and stores the urine produced by the kidneys. Urine passes into the bladder through the ureters; the release of urine from the bladder is controlled by a sphincter at its junction with the urethra. The bladder neck is the outlet of the bladder where it joins the urethra and in males it is in contact with the prostate gland; it is under the control of the autonomic nerves of the pelvis. The neck of the bladder is the commonest site for retention of urine, usually by an enlarged prostate or a urethral stricture. See also DETRUSOR. 
- (2) any of several other hollow organs containing fluid, such as the gall bladder.
