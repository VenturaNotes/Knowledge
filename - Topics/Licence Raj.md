- Also referred to as Permit Raj. A derogatory name for the system of regulations governing the private sector in India which were put in place by the 1951 Industries (Development and Regulation) Act as part of centrally planned industrialization. Under this system, private operations in the manufacturing sector required an official licence. Economic liberalization reforms initiated by the Indian government in the late 1980s and early 1990s abolished licensing for almost all industries.
