## Characteristics
- Periodic with period 2$\pi$ [^1]
- Odd Function [^2]
- For right triangles [^3]
	- $sin\theta = \frac {\text{opp}}{\text{hyp}}$
- For [[Unit Circle]] [^4]
	- $sin\theta = \frac {\text{y}}{\text{r}}$
- Limit [^5] [^6]
	- $lim_{x \to 0} \frac{sin x}{x} =1$
- Derivative of $sin(x)$ [^7]
	- $cos(x)$
## Source[^8]
- SINE: (short interspersed element) Any of a class of dispersed moderately repetitive DNA found in eukaryotes, consisting of numerous copies ( $>10^{5}$ ) of relatively short ( $<500~ \mathrm{bp}$ ) sequences scattered throughout the genome. SINEs are not translated into proteins, occur mostly in introns, and are nonautonomous retrotransposons, which require a reverse transcriptase from another source (probably a LINE) in order to replicate via an RNA intermediate. The most notable example in humans and other primates is the Alu family.
