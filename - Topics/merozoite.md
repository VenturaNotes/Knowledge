- $n$. a stage in the life cycle of the malaria parasite (Plasmodium). Many merozoites are formed during the asexual division of the schizont (see SCHIZOGONY). The released merozoites may invade new red blood cells or new liver cells, and continue the asexual phase with the production of yet more merozoites, effectively spreading the infection. Alternatively, merozoites invade red blood cells and begin the sexual cycle with the formation of male and female sex cells (see MICROGAMETOCYTE; MACROGAMETOCYTE).
