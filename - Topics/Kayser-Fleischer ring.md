- a brownish-yellow ring in the outer rim of the cornea of the eye. It is a deposit of copper granules and is diagnostic of Wilson's disease. When well developed it can be seen by unaided observation, but faint Kayser-Fleischer rings may only be detected by specialized slit-lamp ophthalmological examination. \[B. Kayser (1869-1954), German ophthalmologist; B. Fleischer (1848-1904), German physician]
