- An early name for a supervisor. In current terminology an executive is not strictly speaking a program since the latter is usually taken to refer to one or more processes that are collaborating in order to achieve results on behalf of a single user. By contrast an executive is responsible for the supervision of many disjoint processes, which do not cooperate in any way.
