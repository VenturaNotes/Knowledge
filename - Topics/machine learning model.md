## Synthesis
- Result of the machine learning process. 
	- #question What does the machine learning process look like?
- It's the specific mathematical representation or algorithm that has been trained on a dataset. 
	- #question Is this saying that the machine learning model is the algorithm itself or is it the algorithm which was needed to produce the result which is the machine learning model?
- A trained model will have learned patterns and relationships from data allowing it to make predictions or classifications on unseen data 
	- Some examples are natural language processing to recognize intent behind previously unheard sentences or image recognition which can identify objects
- It's the artifact that performs the task after the learning has occurred.
	- #question What does artifact mean? Is it the same as task or is artifact another ML term?
## Source [^1]
- A machine learning model is a program that can find patterns or make decisions from a previously unseen dataset.
	- Examples
		- In natural language processing, a machine learning model can parse and correctly recognize intent behind previously unheard sentences or combinations of words
			- #question What is meant by "intent" here?
			- #question How does a machine learning model know this?
		- In image recognition, a machine learning model can be taught to recognize objects such as cars or dogs
			- #question How would it do this?
			- #question Is supervised learning the only approach to this?
