- A condition which is enough for a statement to be true. For example, for a number to be even, it is sufficient that the number be divisible by 10. Note that if A is a necessary condition for B, B is a sufficient condition for A, and vice versa, so in the above example for a number to be divisible by 10 it is necessary that the number is even.
