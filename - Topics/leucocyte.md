In health there are three major subdivisions: granulocytes, lymphocytes and monocytes, which are part of the immune system, being involved in protecting the body against foreign substances and in antibody production. In disease, a variety of other types may appear in the blood, most notably immature forms of the normal red or white blood cells.

- (white blood cell) A colorless cell with a nucleus, found in blood and lymph. Leucocytes are formed in lymph nodes and red bone marrow and are capable of amoeboid movement. They can produce antibodies and move through the walls of vessels to migrate to the sites of injuries, where they surround and isolate dead tissue, foreign bodies, and bacteria. There are two major types: those without granules in the cytoplasm, such as lymphocytes and monocytes (see agranulocyte), and those with granular cytoplasm (granulocytes), which include basophils, eosinophils, and neutrophils.
