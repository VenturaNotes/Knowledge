- The adjustment of a debt, either as a result of legal action or by agreement between the interested parties, to give the debtor a more feasible arrangement with the creditors for meeting the financial obligations. This may take the form of a debt-for-equity swap. The management of a company may also voluntarily restructure debt, for example by replacing long-term debt with short-term debt. Debt restructuring can also involve sovereign entities, as in March 2012 when Greece agreed to the biggest debt restructuring in history in order to secure an aid package from the European Union. See SOVEREIGN DEBT.
