- A bond that does not make any periodic coupon payments. A zero coupon bond is sold at a discount from its face value but pays the face value at maturity. For example, a zero coupon bond with a face value of $£ 1000$ and one year to maturity may sell for $£ 909$. The return to the investor is determined by the discount. For the example, $£ 909$ invested in the bond is rewarded with the face value of $£ 1000$ a year later, which is an annual return of 10 per cent. See also STRIPPED BOND.
