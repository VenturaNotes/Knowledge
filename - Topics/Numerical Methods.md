- Methods designed for the constructive solution of mathematical problems requiring particular numerical results, usually on a computer. A numerical method is a complete and unambiguous set of procedures for the solution of a problem, together with computable error estimates (see ERROR ANALYSIS). The study and implementation of such methods is the province of numerical analysis.
