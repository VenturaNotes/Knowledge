- $n$. A phenomenon of selective attention that occurs in classical conditioning, in both human and animal learning of compound cues. The standard demonstration of the effect involves a learning phase in which an experimental group is exposed to a conditioned stimulus $A$ (such as a tone), repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus $X$ (such as shock), and a control group is not exposed to this pairing; then both groups are exposed to a compound stimulus $A B$ composed of $A$ (tone) plus a second conditioned stimulus $B$ (light), repeatedly paired with the same unconditioned stimulus $X$ (shock). The outcome is that when both groups are tested for the strength of the learned association between $B$ (light) and $X$ (shock), which have been paired the same number of times in both groups, a weaker association is found in the experimental group than in the control group. \[Named after the US psychologist Leon J. Kamin (born 1927) who first reported it in a book chapter published in 1968]
