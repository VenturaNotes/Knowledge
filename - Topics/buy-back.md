- (1) The buying back by a company of its shares from an investor, who put venture capital up for the formation of the company. The shares are bought back at a price that satisfies the investor, which has to be the price the company is willing to pay for its independence. The buy-back may occur if the company is publicly floated or is taken over. 
- (2) The buying back by a corporation, especially in the USA, of its shares to reduce the number on the market, either to increase the return on those shares still available or to remove threatening shareholders. 
- (3) Action by a developing country's government to reduce some or all of its debt to overseas banks by buying back that debt at the market price or at a substantial discount. The attraction for the banks is the removal of a damaging and negative debt, which may already have been provided for in its balance sheet. The advantage to the country in debt is a return to creditworthiness and the possibility of acquiring new loans.
