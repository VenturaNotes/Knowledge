- (ECB) The central bank of the European Union, which was established in 1998 under the terms of the Maastricht Treaty and became fully operational on 1 January 1999. From that date it superseded the European Monetary Institute and the European Monetary Cooperation Fund. It is responsible for eurozone monetary policy and in particular the setting of interest rates. It is independent of national governments but works with the central banks of the individual eurozone countries through the Euro System. It is based in Frankfurt am Main, Germany. Since 2010 the ECB has taken a leading role in attempting to resolve the sovereign debt crisis affecting the eurozone (see EUROPEAN Stability Mechanism). See also European Economic and Monetary Union; European System of Central Banks.
