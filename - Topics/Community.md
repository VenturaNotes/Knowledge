- A naturally occurring assemblage of plant and animal species living within a defined area or habitat. Communities are named after one of their dominant species (e.g. a pine community) or the major physical characteristics of the area (e.g. a freshwater pond community). Members of a community interact in various ways (e.g. through food chains and competition). Large communities may be divided into smaller component communities. See aSSOCIATION.
