- (AIS) an X-linked (see SEX-LINKED) disorder in which the body does not react to androgens because of structural abnormalities in androgen receptors. In its most extreme form, complete AIS (formerly known as testicular feminization syndrome), there is a fully female body appearance with breast development and a short vagina (but no uterus; testes are present internally). Psychosexuality is female orientated. Partial AIS is also known as Reifenstein's syndrome.
