- A political and economic grouping of certain nations of South East Asia, formed in 1967 and currently comprising: Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Indonesia, Brunei, Laos, Burma, Vietnam, and Cambodia. The countries are very diverse-for example, the per capita income of Singapore is over 60 times that of Vietnam - and interests often diverge accordingly. Although ASEAN is committed to strengthening economic ties, progress has been limited. There has also been political, technological, and cultural cooperation. There are regular consultations between ASEAN and the major industrialized countries.
