- $n$. an excessively arched foot, giving an unnaturally high instep. In most cases the cause is unknown, but the deformity may sometimes be due to an imbalance between the muscles flexing the toes and the shorter muscles that extend them; this type is found in some neuromuscular diseases, such as Friedreich's ataxia. Surgical treatment is effective in childhood but less so in adult life. Medical name: pes cavus.
