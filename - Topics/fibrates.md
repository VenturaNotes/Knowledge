- pl. n. a class of drugs, chemically related to fibric acid, that are capable of reducing concentrations of triglycerides in the blood (see HYPERTRIGLYCERIDAEMIA); they may also reduce plasma low-density lipoproteins and they tend to raise the levels of the beneficial high-density lipoproteins. Fibrates are used for treating hyperlipidaemia; they include bezafibrate, ciprofibrate, fenofibrate, and gemfibrozil. Fibrates can have adverse effects on muscle (see MYOSITIS).
