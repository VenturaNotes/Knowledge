- $n$. A compound image composed of smaller images, typically a large letter of the alphabet composed of smaller letters (see illustration), used to study global and local cognitive processing. If the large figure has the same shape as its component elements, then the figure is congruent, because the global feature and the local features are the same; otherwise the figure is incongruent. Human observers generally identify the global features of incongruent Navon figures more quickly than the local features, perceiving a letter H composed of small M letters initially as an H rather than a collection of Ms (this is called the global advantage), but people with simultanagnosia display impaired global processing and have difficulty identifying global features, and non-human primates, such as capuchin monkeys, generally display a local advantage, identifying local features more quickly. Compare hybrid image. \[Named after the Israeli cognitive psychologist David Navon (born 1943) who introduced the idea in an article in the journal Cognitive Psychology in 1977]
