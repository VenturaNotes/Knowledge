- a partial paralysis of the arm caused by injury to a baby's brachial plexus during birth. This may result from an obstetric manoeuvre in which the arm is raised at the shoulder to an extreme degree, which damages the lower cervical (neck) and upper thoracic (chest) nerve roots of the spinal cord. It results in weakness and wasting of the muscles of the hand. \[A. Klumpke (1859-1927), French neurologist]
