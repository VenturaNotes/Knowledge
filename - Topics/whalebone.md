- (baleen) Transverse horny plates hanging down from the upper jaw on each side of the mouth of the toothless whales (see CETACEA), forming a sieve. Water, containing plankton on which the whale feeds, enters the open mouth and is then expelled with the mouth slightly closed, so that food is retained on the baleen plates.
