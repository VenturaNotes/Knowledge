- a malignant tumor of the lymphatic system, most commonly affecting children and largely confined to tropical Africa in a zone $15^{\circ}$ north and south of the equator. It is the most rapidly growing malignancy, with a tumor doubling time of about five days. It can arise at various sites, most commonly the facial structures, such as the jaw, and in the abdomen. The Epstein-Barr virus plays a role in the origin and growth of the tumor. Complications affecting the nervous system occur in up to $50 \%$ of cases. Non-African Burkitt's lymphoma is increasingly being recognized. All forms are very sensitive to cytotoxic drug therapy but cure is uncommon. \[D. P. Burkitt (1911-93), Irish surgeon]
