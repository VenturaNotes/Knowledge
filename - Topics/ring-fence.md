- (1) To allow one part of a company or group to go into receivership or bankruptcy without affecting the viability of the rest of the company or group. 
- (2) To assign a sum of money to a particular purpose so that it does not become part of the general resources of an organization. 
- (3) To separate one part of a business from another for regulatory reasons. This is sometimes enforced when e.g. a public utility is acquired by a parent company with wider business interests. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis a similar model has often been proposed for banks that engage in both everyday retail banking and more speculative activities.
