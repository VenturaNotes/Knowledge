- A system enabling individuals and companies to donate money to charities and for the charities to recover the tax paid on these donations. The taxpayer must make a gift aid declaration to the charity, stating that the payment is to be treated as gift aid. This system was first introduced in 1990, but tax relief was subject to the donation being of a minimum value. From April 2000 the system was extended to gifts of any value, including regular and one-off payments. It replaced the deed of covenant in favor of charities from that date, although existing covenants remain valid. There are equivalent arrangements whereby tax relief can be obtained on gifts of land, stocks and shares, or plant and machinery.
