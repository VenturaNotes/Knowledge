- The perception that an allocation treats all economic agents fairly. One method of testing for fairness is the no-envy criterion: an allocation satisfies no-envy if there is no economic agent that prefers some other agent's allocation to their own; there are various alternative criteria. Fairness is related to, but distinct from, equity.
