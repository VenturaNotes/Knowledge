- $n$. A slender slab, extending through the full thickness of the primary visual cortex (Area V1), consisting of cells that are selectively responsive to stimuli oriented at a particular angle in their receptive fields, the specific angle changing from one orientation column to the next by a regular amount of 10 degrees clockwise or anticlockwise for every horizontal movement of 0.05 millimetre, or a full circuit of 180 degrees per millimetre (approximately). With appropriate biochemical staining, orientation columns in the primary visual cortex of an organism being stimulated by parallel stripes oriented at a particular angle show up as a complex but regular configuration of 1-millimetre stripes unrelated to the pattern of ocular-dominance columns.
