## Source [^1]
- A sugar that cannot donate electrons to other molecules and therefore cannot act as a reducing agent. Sucrose is the most common nonreducing sugar. The linkage between the glucose and fructose units in sucrose, which involves aldehyde and ketone groups, is responsible for the inability of sucrose to act as a reducing sugar.
