- the structures that produce and drain away fluid from the eye (see illustration). The lacrimal gland secretes tears, which drain away through small openings (puncta) at the inner corner of the eye into two lacrimal canaliculi. From there the tears pass into the nasal cavity via the lacrimal sac and the nasolacrimal duct.
