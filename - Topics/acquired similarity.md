## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. A tendency for items that were previously perceived as dissimilar to be perceived as the same as a result of learning to use them for the same purpose or to classify them in the same category or with the same label. For example, in Japanese, /r/ and /l/ are allophones that do not give distinct meanings to different words, and as a result Japanese speakers often lack the ability to distinguish between them, but this causes problems for native Japanese speakers of English, because in English /r/ and /l/ distinguish minimal pairs such as right and light and are therefore different phonemes. Compare ACQUIRED DISTINCTIVENESS.
