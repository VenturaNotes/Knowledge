- Directly enables a user to accomplish a task
- A functional requirement describes a specific function or feature that the system must perform, which directly enables a user to accomplish a task 
	- My example is that the implementation of a resizer tool in Photoshop is a functional requirement.
### Examples in Software
- (1) System allows users to log in with a valid username and password

- (3) System allows users to add items to shopping cart
- (4) System processes payment using credit card
- (5) System generates a daily sales report
- (6) System allows users to search for documents by keyword
