- The science of complex systems. It draws on a wide range of disciplines, including biology, physics, computer science, mathematics, and engineering, to investigate the behavior of natural complex systems, such as the brain, the cell, or an ecosystem, as well as human-constructed systems, such as computer networks. Modelling of complex systems may reveal underlying governing principles, enable prediction of emergent behavior, and allow for better management of existing systems. See also SYSTEMS BIOLOGY.
