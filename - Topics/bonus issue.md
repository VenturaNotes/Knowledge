## Source [^1]
- An issue of additional shares in a company to existing shareholders, in proportion to their holdings. This is distinguished from a rights issue, where existing shareholders are offered first option on new shares, at a preferential price, but only get them if they pay for them. Bonus issues bring in no cash to the company, and are made as a gesture of confidence, and a signal of a probable rise in dividends.
