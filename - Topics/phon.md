- $n$. a unit of loudness of sound. The intensity of a sound to be measured is compared by the human ear to a reference tone of $2 \times 10^{-5}$ pascal sound pressure and 1000 hertz frequency. The intensity of the reference tone is increased until it appears to be equal in loudness to the sound being measured; the loudness of this sound in phons is then equal to the number of decibels by which the reference tone has had to be increased.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. The standard unit of loudness level, ranging upwards from zero for the faintest audible sound. The loudness in phons of a sound is defined as the intensity level in units of decibel sound pressure level (dB SPL) of a comparison pure tone of 1,000 hertz that is judged by the listener to be equally loud. Thus if the comparison tone is 20 dB SPL, then the loudness of any tone of another frequency that is judged to be equally loud is defined to be 20 phons; if the comparison tone is 40 dB SPL, then any tone judged equally loud is 40 phons, and so on. See also equal-loudness contour. \[From Greek phone sound or voice]
