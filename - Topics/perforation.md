- $n$. the formation of a hole in a hollow organ. This may occur in the course of a disease (e.g. perforation from a duodenal ulcer, or stomach cancer), allowing the flow of intestinal contents into the peritoneal cavity, with subsequent inflammation (peritonitis), severe abdominal pain, and shock. Treatment is usually by surgical repair of the perforation, but conservative treatment with antibiotics may result in spontaneous healing. Perforations may also be caused by instruments $\textendash$ for example a gastroscope may perforate the stomach or a curette may perforate the uterus $\textendash$ or by injury, for example to the eardrum.
