- weakness of a limb or limbs associated with increased reflex activity. This results in resistance to passive movement of the limb (see sPASTICITY). It is caused by disease affecting the nerve fibers of the pyramidal system, which in health not only initiate movement but also inhibit the stretch reflexes to allow the movements to take place. See also CEREBRAL PALSY.
