## Source [^1]
- [[bus network|BUS]], [[star network|STAR]], and [[ring network|RING]] are all network topologies
## Source[^2]
- Refers to the physical and logical arrangements of devices (nodes) and connections within a computer
	- Describes how data flows between different devices and the structure of their connections, impacting network performance, security and scalability
- Essentially the "map" of how devices are linked together within a network

## Source[^3]
- The [[star topology]] is where all data passes through the central computer

- Network topology describes the physical or logical arrangement of nodes and connections in a network. Physical network topology defines the placement of nodes and their interconnections; logical topology describes the ways data is transferred between nodes. These nodes include devices such as switches and servers. Network topologies follow six basic models, as well as a hybrid combination of one or more models: point-to-point, bus, star, ring, tree, and mesh.
