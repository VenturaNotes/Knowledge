- Pastebin is a content-hosting web application that allows users to store and share plain text online. Pastebin is most commonly used to share source code or configuration data amongst the software development community. Once a user uploads text to a pastebin, other users can then edit it as they please. There are thousands of different pastebins online, the most popular being Pastebin.com. Each pastebin post has its own URL, which can be shared through other online venues such as forums or social media platforms.
