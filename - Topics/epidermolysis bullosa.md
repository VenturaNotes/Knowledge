- any one of a group of genetically determined disorders characterized by blistering of skin and mucous membranes that occurs secondarily to minor mechanical trauma. Many different types exist: milder cases are restricted to skin and mucosal fragility; other types may be complicated by the development of skin squamous cell carcinomas (dystrophic) or death in early childhood due to overwhelming sepsis or airway involvement.
