## Synthesis

- The concept of a broader measure of economic welfare than income per head. This could include in addition to ordinary measures of income items such as the following: the cost of effort; the value of household production, including services such as childcare and looking after the sick and elderly; any depletion of the stock of natural resources; and the value of changes in the natural environment. While such a measure of overall welfare would be of great interest, the observation and valuation of the components is so difficult that any proposed measure would remain highly subjective.
