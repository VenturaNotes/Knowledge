- A technique for injecting substances into cells, cell organelles, or other microscopic structures (e.g. capillaries) using a micropipette. It can be used, for example, to introduce dyes to help visualize cell components or to inject drugs or other substances to investigate their effects at the cellular level. In genetics, microinjection is used to insert DNA fragments or entire nuclei into cells.
