- various forms of therapy that are viewed as complementary to conventional medicine. These include (but are not confined to) osteopathy, acupuncture, homeopathy, massage, aromatherapy, reflexology, and reiki. Previously, complementary therapies were regarded as an alternative to conventional therapies, and the two types were considered to be mutually exclusive (hence the former names alternative medicine and fringe medicine). However, many practitioners now have dual training in conventional and complementary therapies. There is very limited provision for complementary medicine within the National Health Service.
