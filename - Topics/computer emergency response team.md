## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A team established by the administrative authority for a network to act as a focal point for reporting security violations and to disseminate advice and coordinate action to counter such threats to networked systems. A particular CERT usually serves a particular community, often the group of sites connected to a wide area network. In addition the separate CERTs cooperate where there is evidence that a threat crosses community boundaries.
## Source[^2]
- The Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) traditionally refers to a group of experts trained and experienced in responding to computer security events. This term, however, has been evolving in recent years to the Cyber Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT). While the team’s overall goal is to prevent cybersecurity attacks, they also perform several related tasks such as intelligence support, affected party responses, threat identification, and cyber risk mitigation.
