## Source [^1]
- A team established by the administrative authority for a network to act as a focal point for reporting security violations and to disseminate advice and coordinate action to counter such threats to networked systems. A particular CERT usually serves a particular community, often the group of sites connected to a wide area network. In addition the separate CERTs cooperate where there is evidence that a threat crosses community boundaries.
