- A measure, widely used in studies of photosynthesis in plants, of the quantity of light. It is defined as the quantity of radiant energy falling on a small sphere divided by the cross-sectional area of the sphere, and can be expresssed in two ways. Photon fluence (units: $\mathrm{mol}~ \mathrm{m}^{-2}$ ) measures the number of photons falling on the sphere, whereas energy fluence (units: $\mathrm{J} ~\mathrm{m}^{-2}$ ) measures the energy incident on the sphere. Hence the corresponding rates of input are the photon fluence rate (units: mol $\mathrm{m}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ) and the energy fluence rate (units: J $\mathrm{m}^{-2} \mathrm{~s}^{-1}$ ). Many radiation-measuring instruments now used in plant biology record only the part of the spectrum utilized by plants, i.e. radiation of wavelength in the range $400\textendash700 \mathrm{~nm}$; this is termed photosynthetically active radiation (PAR), and fluence rates used in practice are often qualified in this way.
