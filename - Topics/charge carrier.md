- The entity that transports electric charge in an electric current. The nature of the carrier depends on the type of conductor: in metals, the charge carriers are electrons; in semiconductors the carriers are electrons (n-type) or positive holes (p-type); in gases the carriers are positive ions and electrons; in electrolytes they are positive and negative ions.
