- $n$. One of the Flesch indices of the readability of text, defined by the formula $H I=(3.635 \times$ average number of personal words per 100 words) $+(0.314~ \times$ average number of personal sentences per 100 sentences), where personal words are pronouns referring to people, words of identifiable masculine or feminine gender (such as Mary, sister, or iceman), and the words people and folks, and personal sentences are spoken sentences in quotation marks, questions, commands, requests, other sentences addressed directly to the reader, and also exclamations and grammatically incomplete sentences whose meaning has to be inferred from their contexts. A human interest score of zero indicates that the text has no human interest, 30 that it is interesting, 50 that it is very interesting, and 80 that it is dramatic. Although the theoretical upper limit is about 395, in practice human interest scores are almost always below 100. See also READING EASE SCORE.
