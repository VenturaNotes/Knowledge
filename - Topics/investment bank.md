- A US bank that fulfils many of the functions of a UK merchant bank. It is usually one that advises on mergers and acquisitions and provides finance for industrial corporations by buying shares in a company and selling them in relatively small lots to investors. Capital provided to companies is usually long-term and based on fixed assets. In the USA, commercial banks were excluded from selling securities for many years but the law was relaxed in the late 1980s and most of the remaining restrictions were removed in 1999 (see Financial Services Modernization Act 1999). The financial crisis of 2008 saw the demise of several leading investment banks, notably Lehman Brothers, Bear Sterns, and Merrill Lynch.

- A bank dealing mainly with the financing of businesses and, sometimes, the government, rather than the general public. Investment banks raise funds by issuing and selling debt and equity; provide hire purchase and industrial finance; underwrite new issues; advise on and arrange finance for mergers and takeover bids; and manage investment for institutions and wealthy individuals.
