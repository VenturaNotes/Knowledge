## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A person who applies for shares in a new issue in the hope that the price when trading begins will be higher than the issue price. Often measures will be taken by the issuers to prevent excessive stagging; it is usually illegal for would-be investors to attempt to obtain large numbers of shares by making multiple applications. Issuers will often scale down share applications to prevent such quick-profit taking, e.g. by ballot.
## Source[^2]
- To subscribe to new issues of shares in the hope of selling immediately at a profit. A stag is an investor who acts in this way.
