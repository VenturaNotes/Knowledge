## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A person who applies for shares in a new issue in the hope that the price when trading begins will be higher than the issue price. Often measures will be taken by the issuers to prevent excessive stagging; it is usually illegal for would-be investors to attempt to obtain large numbers of shares by making multiple applications. Issuers will often scale down share applications to prevent such quick-profit taking, e.g. by ballot.
