## Source [^1]
- $n$. a peptide containing the amino acids glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine. It functions as a coenzyme in several oxidation-reduction reactions. Glutathione serves as an antioxidant: it reacts with potentially harmful oxidizing agents and is itself oxidized (see also SELENIUM). This is important in ensuring the proper functioning of proteins, haemoglobin, membrane lipids, etc. High levels of glutathione in the blood are associated with longevity.
## Source[^2]
- (GSH) A peptide comprising the amino acids glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine. It occurs widely in plants, animals, and microorganisms, serving chiefly as an antioxidant. Reduced glutathione reacts with potentially harmful oxidizing agents and is itself oxidized, whereupon it is returned to its reduced state by the enzyme glutathione reductase. This is important in ensuring the proper functioning of proteins, haemoglobin, membrane lipids, etc. Glutathione is also involved in amino acid transport across plasma membranes.
