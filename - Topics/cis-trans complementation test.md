- $n$. A test to determine the unit of genetic function and to provide a criterion for defining a cistron by examining whether two independent recessive mutations giving the same abnormal phenotype are located on the same or different genes. A cross is made between homozygotes of each mutation, and the heterozygous offspring are examined. If the mutations are in different genes, then neither mutation will be expressed in the heterozygous offspring because of complementation (each mutant allele being compensated for by the normal allele received from the other parent), whether the mutations are on the same chromosome (in cis position) or on different chromosomes (in trans position); but if the mutations are in the same gene, then the mutation will be expressed in the offspring, but only if the mutations lie in trans position, because in that case both alleles at the specified locus will be mutants. Also called the cis-trans test or complementation test. \[From Latin cis in this side + trans across, over, or beyond]
