- A string of characters used to control the operation of a peripheral device. The composition of these strings is defined in ISO 6429. This standard does allow latitude for manufacturers to define proprietary sequences for specific purposes, and many such sequences are in use; 7-bit and 8-bit versions of the control characters are defined. An earlier standard widely used in the US is ANSI X3.64. See also ESCAPE SEQUENCE.
