- The removal of controls imposed by governments on the operation of markets. Many economists and politicians believe that during the mid-20th century governments imposed controls over markets that had little or no justification. Since the 1980s many governments have followed a deliberate policy of deregulation. However, most economists still argue that certain markets should be regulated, particularly where there is a natural monopoly or a state of market failure. The extent to which deregulation of the US financial sector played a role in precipitating the financial crisis of 2007-08 is a matter of considerable dispute.
