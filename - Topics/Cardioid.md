- The curve traced out by a point on the circumference of a circle rolling round another circle of the same radius. Its equation, in which $a$ is the radius of each circle, may be taken in polar coordinates as $r=2 a(1+\cos \theta)(-\pi<\theta \leq \pi))$. In the figure, $O A=4 a$ and $O B=2 a$.
	- #question Is the parenthesis extra for the right-hand side of the equation?
