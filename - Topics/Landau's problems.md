- At the 1912 ICM, Edmund Landau listed four problems about prime numbers which he considered unapproachable using the mathematics of the time. These were Goldbach's conjecture, the twin prime conjecture, Legendre's conjecture, and the conjecture that there are infinitely many primes of the form $n^2+1$. While there has been progress on these conjectures, they are all still open problems
