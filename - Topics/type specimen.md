- The specimen used for naming and describing a species or subspecies. If this is the original specimen collected by the author who named the species it is termed a holotype. The type specimen is not necessarily the most characteristic representative of the species. The term type is also applied to any taxon selected as being representative of the rank to which it belongs. For example, the genus Solanum (potato) is said to be the type genus of the family Solanaceae.
