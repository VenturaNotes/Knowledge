It may be inherited but can be caused by various conditions, including virus infections, alcohol abuse, beriberi (vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{1}$ deficiency), and amyloidosis. The cause is often unknown. It may result in enlargement of the heart, heart failure, arrhythmias, and thromboembolism. Modern drug treatment improves symptoms and prognosis. See also HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY.
