- n. an antibacterial drug consisting of sulfamethoxazole (a sulphonamide) and trimethoprim, each of which potentiates (increases) the action of the other. Because of the severity of its side-effects, which are those of the sulphonamides, co-trimoxazole is now usually limited to treating Pneumocystis pneumonia, toxoplasmosis, and nocardiasis.
