## Source [^1]
- The process of coating iron or steel with a zinc corrosion-resistant layer by heating it in contact with zinc dust to a temperature slightly below the melting point of zinc. At a temperature of about 371°C the two metals amalgamate to form internal layers of zinc-iron alloys and an external layer of pure zinc. The process was patented by Sherard Cowper-Coles in 1900.
