- (NNP) The gross national product less capital consumption (i.e. depreciation) during the period. NNP is therefore equal to the national income, i.e. the amount of money available in the economy for expenditure on goods and services. However, NNP cannot be considered a very accurate measure, as it is difficult to calculate depreciation reliably.

- The value of the incomes produced by factors of production owned by residents of a country, whether operating domestically or abroad, measured after deducting an estimate of capital consumption. Net national product thus includes the earnings of factors owned by residents and operating abroad, and excludes the earnings of factors operating domestically but owned by non-residents.
