- Mobile portals, or m-portals, are internet gateways that allow mobile devices to connect remotely with an enterprise intranet or extranet. These connections usually take place via a web browser interface and are necessary because they make mobile content and service navigation easier and more reliable. Some wireless networks, such as Google, create their own exclusive mobile portals.
