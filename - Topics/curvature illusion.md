- $n$. A visual illusion in which a semicircle appears more curved than a shorter circular arc with the same radius of curvature (see illustration). The illusion appears to have been discovered by the English physicist Samuel Tolansky (1907-73), who discussed it in his book Optical Illusions (1964), together with a variation that he called the 'lens illusion' involving pairs of curves resembling lenses, commenting that 'I have noticed that there exists a most curious illusory difficulty when we attempt by eye to assess the radius of curvature' (p. 51) and that 'it is strange that these \[two] illusions have escaped notice before' (p. 54). Also called Tolansky's curvature illusion. \[From Latin curvatura bending, from curvare to bend, + -ure indicating an action or process, from Latin -ura]

	- Curvature illusion. The two arcs have the same radius of curvature and are parallel.
