- $n$. inflammation of the rectum. Symptoms are ineffective straining to empty the bowels (tenesmus), urgency, rectal pain, diarrhoea, and the discharge of blood or mucus. Proctitis is invariably present in ulcerative colitis and sometimes in Crohn's disease and a sexually transmitted infection (particularly in those who practise anal intercourse). Rarer causes include damage by irradiation (radiation proctitis), or after a colostomy has rendered the rectum nonfunctional (diversion proctitis).
