- Bank tiers categorize banks and financial institutions based on their size (in terms of total assets) relative to the entire banking market. Because banks can have different growth opportunities depending on the countries and regions they serve, it can be useful to assign bank tiers relative to a bank’s location. Gartner, for example, categorizes banks into tiers based on which of 11 regions the bank is located in (four “mature markets” and seven “emerging markets”) to facilitate a fairer comparison between banks facing varying economic and business conditions.
