- (MODY, monogenic diabetes) a range of rare but important forms of type 2 diabetes mellitus caused by a single autosomal dominant genetic defect. The two commonest forms are mutations of the HNF-1 $\alpha$ gene (MODY 3), which often responds to treatment with sulphonylurea drugs, and mutations of the glucokinase gene (MODY 2), causing a mild elevation of blood glucose levels usually responsive to dietary management.
