- Lending to finance purchases of property. Such lending commonly uses the property concerned as collateral, via mortgages on it. Property lending can be very risky if the loans cover a high percentage of the property's valuation: if property prices fall the collateral may be worth less than the loan, leaving the borrower with negative equity.
