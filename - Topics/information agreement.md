- An agreement by a number of firms to provide one another with information on their prices, discounts, and conditions of sale. This information is usually provided through a trade association, either before or after changes are made. While such an exchange of information is not itself a restrictive practice, it could clearly assist in collusion. In the UK such agreements may be referred to the Competition and Markets Authority.
