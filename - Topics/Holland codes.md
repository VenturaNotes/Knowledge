- $n$. A classification of personality types associated with careers and vocational choices devised by the US psychologist John L(ewis) Holland (1919-2008) and first published in articles in the Journal of Applied Psychology in 1958 and the Journal of Counseling Psychology in 1959. According to this theory, there are six basic types: Doers (Realistic), Thinkers (Investigative), Creators (Artistic), Helpers (Social), Persuaders (Enterprising), and Organizers (Conventional). Later versions of the Strong-Campbell Interest Inventory are based on this typology. Holland's own test to measure these types, first published in 1970, is called the Self-Directed Search (SDS).
