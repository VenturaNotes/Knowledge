- Let $\alpha=a_{1} a_{2} \ldots a_{n}$ denote a string, or word, in the set of all $\Sigma$-words, $\Sigma^{*}$, and let \# be in the alphabet $\Sigma$. then the position tree $\mathrm{T}(\alpha)$ for $\alpha \#$ is a tree whose edges are labelled with elements of$$\Sigma \cup\{\#\}$$and is constructed according to the following rules:
	- (a) $\mathrm{T}(\alpha)$ has $(n+1)$ leaves labelled$$1,2, \ldots, n+1$$(see diagram);
	- (b) the sequence of labels on the edges of the path from the root to the leaf labeled $i$ is the substring identifier for position $i$ in $\alpha \#$.
