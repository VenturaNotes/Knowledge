- (shared derived trait) A trait that is present in the ancestor of a group and in all members of the group. It is thus evidence of the common ancestry of the group. For example, mammary glands are a synapomorphy of mammals. Such traits define the strictly monophyletic groups, or clades, which are the basis of cladistic classification systems (see CLADISTICS). Compare APOMORPHY; PLESIOMORPHY.
