- An alternative set of proposals for international monetary institutions proposed by John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946) at the Bretton Woods negotiations on post-war monetary arrangements in 1944. The Keynes Plan would have involved the creation of an international monetary unit, the 'bancor'. The plan was rejected and the International Monetary Fund was set up instead, on lines proposed by the United States.
