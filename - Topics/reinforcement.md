- $n$. (in psychology) the strengthening of a conditioned reflex (see CONDITIONING). In classical conditioning this takes place when a conditioned stimulus is presented at the same time as $\textendash$ or just before $\textendash$ the unconditioned stimulus. In operant conditioning it takes place when a pleasurable event (or reinforcer), such as a reward, follows immediately after some behavior. The reinforcement schedule governs how often and when such behavior is rewarded. Different schedules produce different effects on behavior.
