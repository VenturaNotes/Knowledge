- an apparatus that detects gamma rays emitted by radioactive isotopes that have been introduced into the body as tracers. It contains an activated sodium iodide crystal (see SCINTILLATOR) and a large array of photomultiplier tubes. Using lead collimators, the position of the source of the radioactivity can be plotted and displayed on a TV monitor or photographic film (see SCINTIGRAM).
