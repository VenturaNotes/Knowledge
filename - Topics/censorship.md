- $n$. The policy or practice of examining publications, television programmes, or other forms of communication with a view to suppressing or altering those that are considered unacceptable or offensive. In psychoanalysis, the suppression of unconscious wishes and their modification before entering consciousness. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) first used the term in its psychoanalytic sense in a letter to Fliess in 1897 (Standard Edition, I, p. 273), and he developed the concept further in his book Interpretation of Dreams (1900, Standard Edition, IV-V), where he used it to explain the distortion of meaning in dreams. According to Freud, the first censorship operates between the unconscious (2) and the preconscious, and the second censorship between the preconscious and consciousness: 'To every transition from one system to that immediately above it (that is, every advance to a higher stage of psychical organization) there corresponds a new censorship' (p. 192).
