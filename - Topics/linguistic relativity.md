- $n$. The hypothesis first suggested by the German ethnologist Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767-1835) and reformulated in the 20th century by the US fire prevention officer and linguist Benjamin Lee Whorf (1897-1943) that people who speak different languages perceive reality and think differently, because categories and distinctions encoded in one language are not necessarily available in another. For example, the language of the North American Hopi Indians has no forms corresponding to English tenses and no words for conceptualizing time as a dimension; therefore, Whorf argued, it would be difficult for a Hopi and an Englishspeaking physicist to understand each other's thinking about time.
