- A rule individuals or firms are obliged to follow; or the procedure for deciding and enforcing such rules. Modern economies are subject to numerous forms of regulation. These may be designed to promote public health and safety: for example, rules on food hygiene and the coding of electrical wiring. They may be designed to promote competition and prevent unfair trading practices: for example, monopolies and mergers are controlled in most societies, and insider dealing is forbidden in many countries. Regulations may be set and enforced by government bodies, or by quasi-autonomous non-governmental organizations (quangos). In the last resort regulation relies on legal sanctions, but the largest proportion of effective regulation is done by the regulators setting standards which organizations then try to comply with as a matter of self-discipline. See also BANK REGULATION; SELF-REGULATION.

- (in embryology) The processes involved in animal embryonic development that counteract any abnormalities that may arise in the different developmental stages. Regulative (or regulation) embryos or eggs can compensate for the removal of sections of the embryo or egg at an early stage of development so that subsequent development is not affected; in such embryos the direction of development of the cells is not determined until cleavage is well advanced. Regulation also includes twinning: the formation of two embryos from the cleavage of a single embryo (see TWINS).
