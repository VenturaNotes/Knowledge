- A subroutine that calls itself. Such a self-referential call must occur as one branch of a conditional statement, otherwise there would be an infinite series of calls. As an example, a recursive subroutine to calculate factorial ( $n$ ) would call itself to calculate factorial $(n-1)$, unless $n=1$ when the value 1 will be returned.
