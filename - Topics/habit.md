- $n$. a sequence of learned behavior occurring in a particular context or as a response to particular events. Habits are often the result of conditioning, are performed automatically and unconsciously, and reduce decision-making. Habits, once established, often persist after the original causal factors no longer operate. Behavioural psychology is based on the premise that one form of conditioning can be replaced by another.
