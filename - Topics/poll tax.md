- A tax that is the same for each individual, i.e. a lump sum per head (from Middle English polle: head). The main benefit claimed for such taxes is that they do not distort choices, being an equal levy from everyone's resources whatever their circumstances; however, poll taxes are often criticized as being regressive in that they do not take account of ability to pay. The community charge, an alternative to domestic rates, was a poll tax introduced in 1990 (1989 in Scotland) and replaced by council tax in 1993.

- A lump-sum tax levied on every citizen at the same rate regardless of income or wealth. A poll tax is necessarily regressive, since it is a larger proportion of low incomes than of high incomes. The UK community charge of 1989-93, though it was labelled 'the poll tax' by its critics, was not exactly a poll tax because it had exemptions for some citizens and lower rates for some taxpayers, taking account of their lower incomes.
