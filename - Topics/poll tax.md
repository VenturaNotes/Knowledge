- A tax that is the same for each individual, i.e. a lump sum per head (from Middle English polle: head). The main benefit claimed for such taxes is that they do not distort choices, being an equal levy from everyone's resources whatever their circumstances; however, poll taxes are often criticized as being regressive in that they do not take account of ability to pay. The community charge, an alternative to domestic rates, was a poll tax introduced in 1990 (1989 in Scotland) and replaced by council tax in 1993.
