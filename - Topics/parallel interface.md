- A connection point that comprises a set of individual electric connections, each having a specified function, usually either data or control. The transfer of data across the interface is achieved by one connection per bit of a data word or byte; for example for 8 bits there would be 8 connections in parallel. The control signals are also carried on individual electric connections in parallel with the data connections. Compare SERIAL INTERFACE, SERIAL-PARALLEL.
