- A closed curve in three-dimensional space which does not intersect itself. The simplest non-trivial knot is the trefoil. Any knot is topologically equivalent (i.e. homeomorphic) to a circle, so the character of a knot is in how the circle has been embedded in space

## Source[^2]
- (1) An intersection of arcs in a graph that is not a planar graph. Where the arcs represent linear code sequences in a program, and the nodes represent branch points in the program, then the presence and frequency of knots is a measure of the complexity of the program (see CONTROL-FLOW GRAPH)
