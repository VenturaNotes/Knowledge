- $n$. Either of two pairs of eleventh cranial nerves, the motor nerves arising partly from the lateral walls of the medulla oblongata and partly from the cervical (neck) region of the spinal cord, divided into the cranial accessory nerves, distributed by the vagus nerve to the muscles of the larynx and pharynx, and the spinal accessory nerves, supplying muscles in the neck, shoulder, and upper back.
## Source[^2]
- (spinal accessory nerve) the eleventh cranial nerve (XI), which arises from two roots, cranial and spinal. Fibres from the cranial root travel with the nerve for only a short distance before branching to join the vagus and then forming the recurrent laryngeal nerve, which supplies the internal laryngeal muscles. Fibres from the spinal root supply the sternomastoid and trapezius muscles, in the neck region (front and back).
