- (haptotropism) The growth of an aerial plant organ in response to localized physical contact. For example, when a tendril of sweet pea touches a supporting structure, it curves in the direction of the support and coils around it. The coiling is the result of differential growth of cells on opposite sides of the tendril. See TROPISM.
