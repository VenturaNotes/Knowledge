- an infectious disease caused by bacteria of the genus Borrelia, which is transmitted by ticks or lice and results in recurrent fever. The first episode of fever occurs about a week after infection: it is accompanied by severe headache and aching muscles and joints and lasts 2-8 days. Subsequent attacks are milder and occur at intervals of 3-10 days; untreated, the attacks may continue for up to 12 weeks. Treatment with antibiotics, such as tetracycline or erythromycin, is effective.
