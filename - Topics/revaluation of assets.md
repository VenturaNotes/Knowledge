- A revaluation of the assets of a company, either because they have increased in value since they were acquired or because inflation has made the balance-sheet values unrealistic. The Companies Act makes it obligatory for the directors of a company to state in the directors' report if they believe the value of land differs materially from the value in the balance sheet. The Act also lays down the procedures to adopt when fixed assets are revalued. Under the Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland (Section 17) a company can choose to measure its fixed assets by regular revaluation (as opposed to historical cost) as long as it applies this treatment consistently to all assets of the same class.
