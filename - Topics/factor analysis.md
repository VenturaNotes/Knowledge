- In statistics, the techniques that aim to reduce the number of explanatory variables (factors) used to explain observational outcomes. New variables are constructed as combinations of the original variables with the aim of identifying a simpler model structure.

- $n$. A statistical technique for analyzing the correlations between a large number of variables in order to reduce them to a smaller number of underlying dimensions, called factors, in a manner analogous to the way in which all spectral colors can be reduced to combinations of just three primary colors, and to determine how much of the variance in each of the original variables is explained by each factor.
