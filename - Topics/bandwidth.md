- The amount of data that can be transmitted in a fixed amount of time

## Source[^2]
- The theoretical maximum amount of data that can be transferred over a communication channel. It is measured in bits per second.

## Source[^3]
- The scale of the neighbourhood of a point that is utilized in the non-parametric estimation of a function at that point. For example, if a histogram is used as a non-parametric estimator of the probability density function, the bandwidth is the size of the bin (the range of values in each category). See also KERNEL REGRESSION.
