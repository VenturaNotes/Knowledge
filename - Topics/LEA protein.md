- (late embryogenesis abundant protein) Any of a group of proteins produced in plants, microorganisms, and some invertebrates in response to drought or desiccation. For example, LEA proteins are produced in seeds during maturation as they dry out. They act by stabilizing cell membranes and other protein components to prevent their aggregation when water content falls.
