## Source [^1]
- An ion or molecule that can donate electrons. Nucleophiles are often oxidizing agents and Lewis bases. They are either negative ions (e.g. $Cl^{-}$) or molecules that have electron pairs (e.g. $NH_3$). In organic reactions they tend to attack positively charged parts of a molecule. Compare electrophile.
