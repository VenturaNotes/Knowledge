- For a subspace $U$ of an inner product space $V$, the orthogonal complement $$U^{\bot} = \{v \in V: \langle v,u\rangle = 0 \text{ for all u}\in U\}$$is a subspace of $V$. It is often referred to as 'U perp'. If $V$ is finite-dimensional, then $V=U$ $\bigoplus U^{\bot}$, which generalizes to closed subspaces of Hilbert spaces
