- (pass instruction, do-nothing instruction) An instruction that causes no action to take place in the computer except for consumption of time and instruction storage space. There are several uses for this instruction including time adjustment of a program, filling out program space in a system where instruction boundaries do not always coincide with word boundaries, and replacement of unwanted instructions without having to recompute all other program addresses.
