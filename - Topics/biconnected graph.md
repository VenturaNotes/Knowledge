- A graph $G$, either directed or undirected, with the property that for every three distinct vertices $u, v$, and $w$ there is a path from $u$ to $w$ not containing $v$. For an undirected graph, this is equivalent to the graph having no cut vertex.
- Two edges of an undirected graph are said to be related either if they are identical or if there is a cycle containing both of them. This is an equivalence relation and partitions the edges into a set of equivalence classes, $E_{1}, E_{2}, \ldots E_{n}$, say. Let $V_{i}$ be the set of vertices of the edges of $E_{i}$ for $i=1,2, \ldots n$. Then each graph $G_{i}$ formed from the vertices $V_{i}$ and the edges $E_{i}$ is a biconnected component of $G$.
