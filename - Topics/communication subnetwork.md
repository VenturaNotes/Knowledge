- An identifiable and separate part of network. A division of a network into subnetworks generally reflects an organization’s organigram or a division of the tasks to be accomplished by the network. The concept of subnetwork is especially important in internetworking, as it allows two initially distinct networks to be seen as parts (subnetworks) of a third—the network composed of their interconnections.
