- a combination of paraesthesia (pins and needles), numbness, and pain in the hand, usually affecting the thumb, index, and middle fingers and sometimes extending to the medial aspect of the fourth finger. The symptoms are usually worse at night, and in longstanding cases there may be weakness of grip due to wasting of the thenar eminence of the thumb. It is caused by pressure on the median nerve as it passes through the wrist (see CARPAL TUNNEL), which may result from any continuous repetitive movements of the hand, such as keyboarding, or any condition causing local swelling. It is common in rheumatoid arthritis, myxoedema, pregnancy, and at the menopause, when it is more likely to be bilateral. Treatment is by splinting of the wrist, NSAIDs, injection of a steroid, or - in severe cases - by surgical release of the nerve under local anaesthesia.
