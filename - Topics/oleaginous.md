- Producing or containing oil or lipids. Oleaginous microorganisms (e.g. yeasts), which normally contain 20-25% oil, are of interest in biotechnology as alternative sources of lipids or as possible sources for novel oils. The majority of the oils produced by oleaginous eukaryotic microorganisms are similar to plant oils.
