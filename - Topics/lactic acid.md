## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- a compound that forms in the cells as the end-product of glucose metabolism in the absence of oxygen (see GLYCOLYSIS). During strenuous exercise pyruvic acid is reduced to lactic acid, which may accumulate in the muscles and cause cramp. Lactic acid (owing to its low pH ) is an important food preservative. The lactic acid produced by the fermentation of milk is responsible for the preservation and flavor of cheese, yoghurt, and other fermented milk products.
## Source[^2]
- (2-hydroxypropanoic acid) An alpha hydroxy carboxylic acid, $\mathrm{CH}_{3} \mathrm{CH}(\mathrm{OH}) \mathrm{COOH}$, with a sour taste. Lactic acid is produced from pyruvic acid in active muscle tissue when oxygen is limited (see OXYGEN DEBT) and subsequently removed for conversion to glucose by the liver. During strenuous exercise it may build up in the muscles, causing cramplike pains. It is also produced by fermentation in certain bacteria and is characteristic of sour milk.
