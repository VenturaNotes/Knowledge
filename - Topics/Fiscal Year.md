- A fiscal year is a 12-month period that businesses use to file and report their finances. However, fiscal years do not necessarily have to correspond with the calendar year. Corporations typically determine their fiscal year based on their business activities, revenue cycle, and tax reporting requirements. Fiscal years are important because they allow companies to accurately measure how much revenue they have gained over a 12-month period. This information is needed to appropriately file their business taxes.

Income tax, capital gains tax, and annual allowances for inheritance tax are all calculated for fiscal years, and the UK Budget estimates refer to the fiscal year. In the USA the fiscal year now runs from 1 October to the following 30 September. The fiscal year is sometimes called the tax year or the year of assessment. Compare FINANCIAL YEAR.
