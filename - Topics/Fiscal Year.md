- A fiscal year is a 12-month period that businesses use to file and report their finances. However, fiscal years do not necessarily have to correspond with the calendar year. Corporations typically determine their fiscal year based on their business activities, revenue cycle, and tax reporting requirements. Fiscal years are important because they allow companies to accurately measure how much revenue they have gained over a 12-month period. This information is needed to appropriately file their business taxes.
