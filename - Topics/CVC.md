- abbrev. Consonant-vowel-consonant, the type of nonsense syllable most often used in research into memory, typical examples being WUD and $K E B$, the initials C and V standing for phonetic consonants and vowels$\textemdash$speech sounds rather than letters$\textemdash$so that strictly speaking $D A X$ is not CVC but CVCC, because the $X$ represents two phonemes /ks/. The various types of syllable that can exist within a language are denoted analogously; thus in English it is possible to have clusters of up to three consonants at the beginning of a syllable (as in splash, which is CCCVC) and up to four at the end of a syllable (as in sixths, which is CVCCCC). See also CVC TRIGRAM.
