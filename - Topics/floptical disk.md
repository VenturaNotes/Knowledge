- A hybrid optical and magnetic disk. The data was written and read by a magnetic head in the usual way, but head tracking was controlled by an optical servo track and head. This gave more precise tracking than the conventional magnetic servo track, so data tracks could be packed more closely, giving a larger disk capacity than that of a conventional floppy disk. Floptical disks never achieved widespread use and were superseded by recordable CDs.
