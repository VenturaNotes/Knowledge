- $n$. a substance contained within the red blood cells (erythrocytes) and responsible for their colour, composed of the pigment haem (an iron-containing porphyrin) linked to the protein globin. Haemoglobin has the unique property of combining reversibly with oxygen and is the medium by which oxygen is transported within the body. It takes up oxygen as blood passes through the lungs and releases it as blood passes through the tissues. Blood normally contains 115 to $180 \mathrm{~g} / \mathrm{l}$ of haemoglobin. See also MYOGLOBIN; OXYHAEMOGLOBIN.
## Source[^2]
- One of a group of globular proteins occurring widely in animals as oxygen carriers in blood. Vertebrate haemoglobin is contained in the red blood cells (erythrocytes). It comprises two pairs of polypeptide chains, known as $\alpha$-chains and $\beta$-chains (forming the globin protein), with each chain folded to provide a binding site for a haem group. Each of the four haem groups binds one oxygen molecule to form oxyhaemoglobin. Dissociation occurs in oxygen-depleted tissues: oxygen is released and haemoglobin is reformed (see BOHR EFFECT; HAEMOGLOBINIC ACID; OXYGEN DISSOCIATION CURVE). The haem groups also bind other inorganic molecules, including carbon monoxide (to form carboxyhaemoglobin). Carbon dioxide can bind to terminal $-\mathrm{NH}_{2}$ groups of the $\alpha$- and $\beta$-chains, forming carbamino groups ($-\mathrm{NHCOO}^{-}$), in which form a significant fraction of carbon dioxide is transported in the red blood cells.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A protein present in erythrocytes (red blood corpuscles). It consists of haem, a red organic pigment containing iron, and globin, a protein, and it combines reversibly with oxygen and plays a vital role in the transport of oxygen through the bloodstream to the tissues. US hemoglobin. Hb abbrev. \[From Greek haima blood + Latin globus a sphere]
