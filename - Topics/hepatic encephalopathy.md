- (portosystemic encephalopathy) a condition in which brain function is impaired by the presence of toxic substances, absorbed from the colon, which are normally removed or detoxified by the liver. It occurs when the liver is severely damaged (as in cirrhosis) or bypassed. Symptoms include drowsiness, confusion, changes in personality, difficulty in performing tasks (e.g. writing), and coma. Treatment is mainly directed towards the underlying cause of liver disease and to any factors that may have precipitated the clinical deterioration (e.g. recent gastrointestinal haemorrhage, opiate medication, etc). Supportive measures consist of administering bowel cleansers (especially lactulose, orally or by enema) and reducing protein and/or salt intake.
