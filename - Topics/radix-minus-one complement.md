- (diminished radix complement) For an integer represented in a fixed-radix number system, a number formed by replacing each digit $d$ in the integer by its complement, i.e. by$$(R-1-d)$$where $R$ denotes the radix of the system. For example, in the decimal system the [[nine's complement]] of 0372 is 9627 ; in the binary system the [[one's complement]] of 1100 is 0011. See also COMPLEMENT NUMBER SYSTEM, RADIX COMPLEMENT.
