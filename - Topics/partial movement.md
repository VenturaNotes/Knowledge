- $n$. A form of apparent movement that occurs when two visual stimuli a few centimetres apart are presented in an alternating pattern with an interstimulus interval too long for the stimuli to appear simultaneous but not long enough for optimal movement, phi movement, or the disappearance of apparent movement and the veridical perception of the stimuli simply alternating. In partial movement, the first stimulus appears to move part of the distance towards the second and then to disappear, then the second stimulus appears in the space between the two stimuli and moves towards its own location, then this cycle is repeated in the opposite direction, and so on. Also called partial motion. See also Korte's laws.
