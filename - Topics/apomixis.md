- (agamospermy) A reproductive process in plants that superficially resembles normal sexual reproduction but in which there is no fusion of gametes. In apomictic flowering plants there is no fertilization by pollen, and the embryos develop simply by division of a diploid cell of the ovule. See also PARTHENOCARPY; PARTHENOGENESIS.
