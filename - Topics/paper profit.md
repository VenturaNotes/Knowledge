- A profit shown by the books or accounts of an organization that is not a realized profit. This is usually for one of three reasons:
	- because the value of an asset has fallen below its book value;
	- because the asset, although nominally showing a profit, has not actually been sold;
	- because some technicality of book-keeping shows an activity to be profitable when it is not.
- For example, a share that has risen in value since its purchase might show a paper profit but this would not be a real profit since the value of the share might fall again before it is sold.
