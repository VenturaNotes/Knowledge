- In coding theory, codes whose encoding and decoding operations may be expressed in terms of linear operations. The term is usually applied to certain error-correcting codes in which the encoding operation involves a generator matrix and the decoding operation involves a parity-check matrix. Linear codes are, therefore, also called [[parity-check code|parity-check codes]]. A particular linear code forms a commutative group that has the zero codeword as its identity.
- In the case of linear $(n, k)$ block codes, the generator matrix is $k \times n$ and the parity-check matrix is $(n-k) \times n$; the elements of both matrices are elements of the base field (this being $\{0,1\}$ for binary codes). See also CONVOLUTIONAL CODE.
