## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- Of a proof or method that uses an algorithm or other effective procedure to prove the result or yield answers. By contrast, a non-constructive proof may demonstrate the existence of a mathematical object without providing any method to determine that object. As an example, the formula for solving quadratic equations explicitly describes the roots but the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra only shows existence of roots and nothing more.
