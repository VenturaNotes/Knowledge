## Source[^2]
- (automorphism group) An isomorphism of a mathematical object with itself$\textemdash$so a one-to-one correspondence from a set onto itself, preserving any further structure (usually algebraic) that is present. For example, complex conjugation is an automorphism of $\mathbb{C}$ as a group or field or real vector space but not as a complex vector space, as it does not respect scalar multiplication. The set of automorphisms of an object $X$, under composition, then form the automorphism group denoted $\operatorname{Aut}(X)$.
