## Source [^1]
- A mass of dark-brown or black fibrous plant debris produced by the partial decay of vegetation, such as mosses of the genus Sphagnum, in acidic wet places (see HYdrosERE). It may accumulate in depressions. When subjected to burial and hence pressure and heat, it may be converted to coal. Peat is often extracted and used to improve soil and as a fuel. However, peat is a globally significant store of carbon, and peatlands are important for retaining water and as wildlife habitats. Hence, there is concern about the impact of extracting peat for horticulture and other uses.
