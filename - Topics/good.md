## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A commodity or service that is regarded by economists as satisfying a human need. An economic good is one that is both needed and sufficiently scarce to command a price. A free good is also needed but it is in abundant supply and therefore does not need to be purchased; air is an example. However, a commodity or service that is free but has required an effort to produce or obtain is not a free good in this sense. See also CONSUMER GOODS.
## Source[^2]
- (1) Things people prefer to consume more of rather than less: thus leisure and security are goods, while pollution is a bad.
- (2) Economic assets taking a tangible physical form, such as houses or clothes. These are contrasted with services, such as transport, which cannot be stored, or insurance, which has no physical embodiment. Some economic goods in sense 1 , such as restaurant meals, are combinations of services and goods in sense 2. See also CAPITAL GOODS; CONSUMER GOODS; FINAL GOODS; FREE GOOD; GIFFEN GOOD; HOMOGENEOUS GOOD; INFERIOR GOOD; INTERMEDIATE GOOD; MERIT GOODS; NORMAL GOOD; PRODUCER GOOD; PUBLIC GOOD.
## Source[^3]
- adj. positive, desirable, or morally admirable. The question of what is to be judged good is at the heart of medical ethics and ethics in general. Some theorists believe that one's intentions or will may or may not be good (see DEONTOLOGY), while others argue that only the consequences of actions may or may not be good (consequentialism). Physicians have an explicit duty to do good for their patients (see BENEFICENCE). See also RIGHT.
