- A commodity or service that is regarded by economists as satisfying a human need. An economic good is one that is both needed and sufficiently scarce to command a price. A free good is also needed but it is in abundant supply and therefore does not need to be purchased; air is an example. However, a commodity or service that is free but has required an effort to produce or obtain is not a free good in this sense. See also CONSUMER GOODS.
