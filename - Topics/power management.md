- Operation of a computer so as to minimize electric power consumption. This is especially important in battery-powered systems, but is now to be found in mains-powered systems. The economies are achieved by shutting down, or reducing power to, high-consumption components after they have been idle for a short period, and starting them up again as soon as any input activity is detected.
