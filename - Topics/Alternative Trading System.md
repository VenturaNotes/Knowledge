- In the USA, a financial trading platform that is not a recognized public exchange but is nevertheless approved and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. In many cases ATSs are fully electronic and buyers and sellers are matched to each other anonymously, so that a transaction only becomes public after it has been completed. There have been concerns that ATS trading provides too little information about trades and positions, thereby increasing the risk of market abuse. However, similar trading systems are now found in most of the world's main financial markets; the European equivalent to the ATS is the multilateral trading facility.
