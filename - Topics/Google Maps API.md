### Uses
- An app that displays maps such as a food delivery service, the app most likely requests map data from Google Maps' API rather than creating its own map
	- This API provides location data, routes, and even traffic updates
	- #question Does Google Maps API cost anything to use?
	- #question How difficult would it be to create your own map for an app?
	- #question Is an API like a wrapper or a container?
	- #question how is google maps able to show traffic updates? Does it have a device in the sky?
