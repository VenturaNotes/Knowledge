- a fracture of the distal end of the radius, which is displaced backwards and upwards to produce a 'dinner fork' deformity. Avulsion of the ulnar styloid process (see ULNA) usually takes place as well. It is usually caused by a fall on the outstretched hand. The bone is restored to its normal position under anaesthesia, and a plaster cast is applied for about six weeks. Complications are residual deformity and stiffness of the wrist. If the fall occurs from less than standing height, it is considered an insufficiency fracture and its presence, in the absence of any other underlying cause, suggests osteoporosis. Early evaluation and treatment for osteoporosis is needed to prevent future fractures. Colles' fractures are more common in women immediately after menopause. \[A. Colles (1773-1843), Irish surgeon]
