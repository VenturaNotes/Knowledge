- The transfer of technological knowledge to a third party, which often occurs when a patent holder grants a licence to another firm to use a technology, process, or product. In many instances this transfer takes place between countries, when a firm establishes an overseas subsidiary or grants a licence to a local producer. It is therefore a means by which countries gain new technology or update their existing technological base, enabling them to build up their industrial infrastructure. See MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE.
