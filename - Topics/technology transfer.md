- The transfer of technological knowledge to a third party, which often occurs when a patent holder grants a licence to another firm to use a technology, process, or product. In many instances this transfer takes place between countries, when a firm establishes an overseas subsidiary or grants a licence to a local producer. It is therefore a means by which countries gain new technology or update their existing technological base, enabling them to build up their industrial infrastructure. See MULTINATIONAL ENTERPRISE.

- The transfer of techniques from countries where they are more advanced to other countries where they are less advanced. Technology transfer may involve foreign direct investment, transfers of skilled personnel from more advanced countries, training of workers from less advanced countries, or licensing of patents. Technology transfer is of great importance to less developed countries but it is useful to all countries.
