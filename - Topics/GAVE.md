- (gastric antral vascular ectasia) a condition characterized by the presence of dilated capillaries or veins in the lining of the distal stomach (the gastric antrum), which may extend to involve the whole of the stomach. It may be diffuse or it may adopt a more linear appearance like the stripes of a watermelon (watermelon stomach). Certain medical conditions (e.g. cirrhosis, systemic sclerosis, and chronic renal failure) are associated with this condition. It is often asymptomatic but can lead to transfusion-dependent anaemia. Treatment focuses on management of the underlying condition and endoscopic treatment of bleeding areas using argon plasma coagulation or laser thermocoagulation.
