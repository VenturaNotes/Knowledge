- Small office/home office (SOHO) refers to a market segment for office equipment that is targeted to small office and home office users. These pieces of equipment are not necessarily lower in quality. However, they are less expensive than equipment meant for larger offices. This is because they will not be used as extensively, or by as many people. They may thus require fewer features.
