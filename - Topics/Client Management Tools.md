- Client management tools—once referred to as PC configuration life cycle management (PCCLM)—refer to how client systems are managed. Client systems are systems that are extensively involved with the operation of computer software, operating systems, or other functionalities of computers. These tools allow for these clients to be appropriately monitored and managed. Most of the time, these tools operate automatically, in the background of your computer operations. They may require periodic updates or configuration.
