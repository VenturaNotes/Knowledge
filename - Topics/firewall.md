- A mechanism to protect a [[network]] from outside attacks

## Source[^2]
- A system designed to control the passage of information from one network into a second network. Typically a firewall will be used as a means of reducing the risk of unwanted access to sensitive systems, where one carefully regulated network contains the sensitive systems and is connected to a larger less-regulated network. A firewall can only be effective if access to the firewall itself is carefully regulated.
