- A mechanism to protect a [[network]] from outside attacks
## Source[^2]
- A system designed to control the passage of information from one network into a second network. Typically a firewall will be used as a means of reducing the risk of unwanted access to sensitive systems, where one carefully regulated network contains the sensitive systems and is connected to a larger less-regulated network. A firewall can only be effective if access to the firewall itself is carefully regulated.
## Source[^3]
- A firewall is a built-in internet security device that blocks all unauthorized access to the network while allowing access to authorized users. A firewall works by first monitoring, then filtering all ingoing/outgoing network traffic and subsequently allowing or blocking outsider access according to pre-set rules.
