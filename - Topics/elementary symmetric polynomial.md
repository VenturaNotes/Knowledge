- For three variables, $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, the elementary symmetric polynomials are $$\sigma_1 = \alpha + \beta + \gamma, \quad \sigma_2 = \alpha\beta + \beta\gamma + \gamma\alpha,\sigma_3 = \alpha\beta\gamma$$These expressions generalize naturally to $n$ variables, with $\sigma_k$ being the sum of the $n \choose k$ products of k of the variables. The elementary symmetric polynomials appear in Vi√®te's formulae
- The elementary symmetric polynomials are symmetric functions, and any symmetric polynomial can be expressed in terms of the elementary symmetric polynomials. For example, if $s_k = \alpha^k + \beta^k + \gamma^k$, then $$s_{k+3} = \sigma_1s_{k+2} - \sigma_2s_{k+1} + \sigma_3s_k$$gives a general recursive means of expressing $s_k$ in terms of $\sigma_1, \sigma_2, ..., \sigma_k$.
