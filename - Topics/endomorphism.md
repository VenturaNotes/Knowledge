- At its most general, a morphism from a mathematical object to itself. This might mean a group or ring homomorphism or a linear map of a vector space. If $X$ is an abelian group, then the endomorphisms of $X$ for ma ring End(X) under pointwise addition and composition as multiplication. End($\mathbb{R}^n)$ is isomorphic to the ring of $n \times n$ real matrices.
