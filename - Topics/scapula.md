- $n$. (pl. scapulas or scapulae) the shoulder blade: a triangular bone, a pair of which form the back part of the shoulder girdle (see illustration). The spine on its dorsal (back) surface ends at the acromion process at the top of the shoulder. This process turns forward and articulates with the collar bone (clavicle) at the acromioclavicular joint; it overhangs the glenoid fossa, into which the humerus fits to form the socket of the shoulder joint. The coracoid process curves upwards and forwards from the neck of the scapula and provides attachment for ligaments and muscles. $\textemdash$scapular adj.

## Source[^2]
- (shoulder blade) (pl. scapulae or scapulas) The largest of the bones that make up each half of the pectoral (shoulder) girdle. It is a flat triangular bone, providing anchorage for the muscles of the forelimb and an articulation for the humerus at the glenoid cavity. It is joined to the clavicle (collar bone) in front.
