- $n$. (pl. scapulas or scapulae) the shoulder blade: a triangular bone, a pair of which form the back part of the shoulder girdle (see illustration). The spine on its dorsal (back) surface ends at the acromion process at the top of the shoulder. This process turns forward and articulates with the collar bone (clavicle) at the acromioclavicular joint; it overhangs the glenoid fossa, into which the humerus fits to form the socket of the shoulder joint. The coracoid process curves upwards and forwards from the neck of the scapula and provides attachment for ligaments and muscles. $\textemdash$scapular adj.
