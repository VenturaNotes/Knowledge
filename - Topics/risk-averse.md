## Source[^2]
- An individual is risk-averse if they prefer a certain pay-off of $M$ to a risky prospect with an expected pay-off of $M$. This will be true whenever the marginal utility of wealth is decreasing, so the utility function is strictly concave. A risk-averse individual will not accept an actuarially fair gamble, and will pay a risk premium to avoid randomness of pay-offs.
