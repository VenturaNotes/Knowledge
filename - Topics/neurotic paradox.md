- $n$. The persistence of neurotic (1) symptoms or behavior despite their distressing qualities and the desire of the afflicted person to be rid of them. For example, a man with obsessive-compulsive disorder may wash his hands many times a day until they bleed, and may consider this behavior unnecessary and maladaptive, or even ridiculous, yet feel compelled to continue doing it, and this appears paradoxical.
