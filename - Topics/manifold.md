- Curves are 1-dimensional manifolds and surfaces are 2-dimensional manifolds. Formally an $n$-dimensional manifold is a Hausdorff topological space X in which every point has a neighborhood which is homeomorphic to $n$-dimensional Euclidean space. Note that the double cone $x^2+y^2=z^2$ is not a manifold as no Euclidean neighborhood of the origin exists
- The above defines what a topological manifold is, but manifolds can have further smooth or metric structure. See classification theorem for surfaces, orientability, transition map, Riemann surface, Riemannian manifold.
