- Productivity is a measure of the efficiency with which inputs, such as labor and capital, are transformed into outputs of goods and services.
- It is a fundamental concept in economics that is closely tied to economic growth, standard of living, and overall well-being of a society.
	- #comment It must be related to absolute advantage as well

- A measure of the output of an organization or economy per unit of input (labor, raw materials, capital, etc.). See also UNIT LABOR COSTS.
## Source[^3]
- The amount of output per unit of input achieved by a firm, industry, or country. This may be per unit of a particular factor of production, for example labor employed, or per unit of land in agriculture, or 'total factor productivity' may be measured, which involves aggregating the different factors. Productivity is determined by the level of output if returns to scale are not constant.

- (production) (in ecology) The rate at which an organism, population, or community assimilates energy (gross productivity) or makes energy potentially available (as body tissue) to an animal that feeds on it (net productivity). The difference between these two rates is due to the rate at which energy is lost through excretion and respiration. Thus gross primary productivity is the rate at which plants (or other autotrophs) assimilate energy, and net primary productivity is the rate at which energy is incorporated as cells or tissue. It is measured in kilojoules per square metre per year $\left(\mathrm{kJ}~ \mathrm{m}^{-2} \mathrm{y}^{-1}\right)$. In terrestrial plants, much of the net productivity is not actually available to consumers, e.g. tree roots are not eaten by herbivores. See also ENERGY FLOW; SECONDARY PRODUCTIVITY.
