- Assets, such as cash and debtors, that have a fixed monetary exchange value and are not affected by a change in the price level. If there are no regulations requiring companies to account for changing price levels, monetary assets remain in the financial statements at their original amounts. If the principle of accounting for changes in price levels is applied, the monetary assets will be indexed.
