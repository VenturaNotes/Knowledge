- Desktop as a service (DaaS) is a type of remote cloud-based workspace that any team member can access from any location with an internet connection. Based on virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) delivered from the cloud, DaaS is offered to users as a monthly or annual subscription. The desktop itself is hosted by the cloud provider, freeing the end-user of the complexity and expense of managing physical servers and networks that require high security.
