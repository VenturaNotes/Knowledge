- A bill of materials (BOM) is a list of items or raw materials used to produce products and structures. A BOM might include:
	- The make and/or model of components used to manufacture products or build structures.
	- The number of items or raw materials required by an organization.
	- The cost of these items or materials.
	- The name of the manufacturer or service provider providing items or materials to an organization.
- For example, a BOM for a car will likely include vehicle parts, such as wheels and brakes, in addition to costs and quantities of these parts.
