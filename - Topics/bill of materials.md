- A bill of materials (BOM) is a list of items or raw materials used to produce products and structures. A BOM might include:
	- The make and/or model of components used to manufacture products or build structures.
	- The number of items or raw materials required by an organization.
	- The cost of these items or materials.
	- The name of the manufacturer or service provider providing items or materials to an organization.
- For example, a BOM for a car will likely include vehicle parts, such as wheels and brakes, in addition to costs and quantities of these parts.

- (BOM) 
- (1) A document listing all the materials required to produce a range of products, including all the components and their relevant quantities, the order in which they are assembled, and the work centres that perform the assembly. The BOM is one of the main inputs into the material requirements planning (MRP) system; in fact, the success of MRP depends on accurate BOMs. Their reliability has been improved by the use of computer-aided design systems linked to inventory status records. 
- (2) See BILL OF QUANTITIES.
