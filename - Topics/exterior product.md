- For $u$ and $v$ in a vector space $V$, their exterior product is denoted $u \land v$ and satisfies $u \land v = -v \land u$. If $v_1, ..., v_n$ form a basis for V, then $v_i\land v_j$, where $i < j$, form a basis for the exterior product $\land^2V$. Further exterior product spaces $\land^kV$ can be defined for $1 \le k \le dim V.$
