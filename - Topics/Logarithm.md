### Rules
- $log_a1 = 0$
	- Can be read as "logarithm of 1 to the base a"
- $log_aa = 1$
- $log_aa^x = x$
- $a^{log_ax} = x$ ^guu88q

### More Rules
- Power Rule
	- $logA^B = BlogA$
- Product Rule
	- $logA*B = logA + logB$
- Quotient Rule
	- $log \frac {A}{B} = logA - logB$

### Facts
- Log function only takes positive numbers as inputs
