## Synthesis
- A logarithm is not defined for non-positive numbers, or base 1.
	- #question Why is a logarithm not able to have a base 1?
## Source[^1]
### Rules
- $log_a1 = 0$
	- Can be read as "logarithm of 1 to the base a"
- $log_aa = 1$
- $log_aa^x = x$
- $a^{log_ax} = x$

## Source[^2]
### More Rules
- Power Rule
	- $logA^B = BlogA$
- Product Rule
	- $logA*B = logA + logB$
- Quotient Rule
	- $log \frac {A}{B} = logA - logB$

## Source[^3]
### Facts
- Log function only takes positive numbers as inputs
