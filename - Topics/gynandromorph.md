- An animal that possesses both male and female characteristics because it is genetically a mosaic, i.e. some of its cells are genetically male and others are female. This phenomenon is found particularly in the insects but also appears in the birds and mammals; it is often due to the loss of an X chromosome in a stem cell of a female (XX), so that all tissues derived from that cell are phenotypically male. Compare INTERSEX.
