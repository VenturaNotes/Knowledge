- $n$. The turning inwards of the eyes in order to fixate an object or image that is closer than the previous fixation point, also called simply convergence. It is one of two binocular cues of visual depth perception, in which kinaesthetic information about the degree of ocular convergence indicates the distance of objects being fixated. See also ACCOMMODATION REFLEX, HOROPTER, OCULOMOTOR CUE, REDUCTION SCREEN, VERGENCE. Compare OCULAR DIVERGENCE. \[From Latin convergere to bend together, from con- together + vergere to incline]
