- $n$. X-ray examination of the urinary bladder after filling it with a contrast medium. The X-ray images thus obtained are known as cystograms. Cystography is most commonly performed to detect reflux of urine from the bladder to the ureters, usually in children (see VESICOURETERIC REFLUX). In adults it is often performed to detect bladder injury or perforation. If films are taken during voiding (micturating cystourethrogram) then the urethra can also be observed (see URETHROGRAPHY). The examination can also be performed in conjunction with manometry (see BLADDER PRESSURE STUDY).
