- A system for settling disputes by submitting them to the judgement of a mediator acceptable to both parties. An arbitrator may be an independent individual, or a committee, often containing nominees of both parties with an independent person in the chair. Arbitration is often used in commercial and labour disputes, as it is usually quicker and cheaper than legal or industrial action. It may be binding, where both parties are obliged by law or by contract to accept the results. Even when it is not binding, the parties may well accept the result rather than face the delays, costs, and risk involved in resort to legal or industrial action. See also PENDULUM ARBITRATION.

- The determination of a dispute by an arbitrator or arbitrators rather than by a court of law. Any civil (i.e. noncriminal) matter may be settled in this way; commercial contracts often contain arbitration clauses providing for this to be done in a specified way. Various industries and chambers of commerce have set up tribunals for dealing with disputes in their particular trades or business. The judgment of the arbitrator may be either binding or indicative. The current legal framework for arbitration is provided by the Arbitration Act 1996 See also Advisory Conciliation and Arbitration Service.
