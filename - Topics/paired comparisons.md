- (1) A technique used in marketing research in which consumers are presented with pairs of competing products and asked to choose the one they prefer. This technique can be used to compare, say, a number of brands of soap, giving respondents two at a time to compare. The number of times each brand is selected as a preference in a large number of such tests will reveal an order of brand preference. Compare MONADIC TESTING.
