- Rules used to decide the priorities for fulfilling orders. Examples include:
	- first-come-first-served (FCFS);
	- first-in-first-out (FIFO)—often seen as a fair rule, especially by the customer, but in practice it leads to overall inefficiency;
	- earliest-due-date (EDD) first-the job due out first is processed first: this ignores arrival times and processing times;
	- shortest processing time (SPT) first-an ideal method for getting small jobs out of the way and minimizing work in progress, but it can make large jobs late and it ignores due dates and arrival times;
	- longest processing time (LPT) first- this tends to increase work in progress and to make short jobs late;
	- truncated shortest processing time (TSPT)—jobs that have been waiting longer than a predetermined time are given priority (if no work has been waiting long, SPT rules apply);
	- critical ratio (CR)—this is the ratio of the time until the due date to the processing time: jobs with the lowest CR are processed first.
