- (287-212 BC) Greek mathematician who is rated one of the greatest of all time. He made considerable contributions to geometry, for example finding the surface area and the volume of a sphere and the area of a segment of a parabola. His work on hydrostatics and equilibria was also fundamental. One of his important works, The Method of Mechanical Theorems, was rediscovered as recently as 1906. He may or may not have shouted 'Eureka' and run naked through the streets, but he was certainly murdered by a Roman soldier in Syracuse, an event that marks the end of a golden era of Greek mathematics.
