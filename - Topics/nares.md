## Source[^2]
- (nostrils) The paired openings of the nasal cavity in vertebrates. All vertebrates have external nares, which open to the exterior; in some species these are situated on a nose. Internal nares (or choanae) are present only in air-breathing vertebrates (including lungfish) and open into the mouth cavity. In mammals they open posteriorly, beyond the secondary palate.
