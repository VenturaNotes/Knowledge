## Synthesis
- In computer science, a formal language is a set of strings of symbols that are drawn from a finite alphabet.
	- #question What could the alphabet consist of? 
	- #question Is it possible to have one that is not finite?
- Formal languages precisely defined by a set of rules 
- Key Aspects:
	- Alphabet: A finite, non-empty set of symbols (e.g., {a, b, c} or {0, 1})
	- String (or Word): A finite sequence of symbols from the alphabet 
	- Language: A subset of all possible strings that can be formed from a given alphabet. This subset is defined by specific rules, often expressed through formal grammars or automata.

- #question I would like to see a few practice questions 
- Formal languages fundamental in theoretical computer science
	- #question What makes up theoretical computer science?
	- Compiler Design: Programming languages are formal languages
		- #question What is compiler design?
	- Automata Theory: Used to describe and analyze the capabilities of abstract machines (automata) in recognizing or generating strings of a formal language
		- #question I would like to see some practice problems for this.

## Source [^1]
- (1) A language with explicit and precise rules for its syntax and semantics. Examples include programming languages and also logics such as predicate calculus. Thus formal languages contrast with natural languages such as English whose rules, evolving as they do with use, fall short of being either a complete or a precise definition of the syntax, much less the semantics, of the language. 
- (2) A finite or infinite set of strings, considered in isolation from any possible meaning the strings or the symbols in them may have. If $A$ is any set, an A-language (or language over $\mathbf{A}$ ) is any set of $A$-words (see WORD). $A$ is referred to as the alphabet of such a language.
