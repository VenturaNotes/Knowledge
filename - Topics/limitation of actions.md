- Statutory rules limiting the time within which civil actions can be brought. Actions in simple contract and tort must be brought within six years of the cause of action. There are several special rules, including that for strict liability actions for defective products, in which case the period is three years from the accrual of the cause of action or (if later) the date on which the plaintiff knew, or should have known, the material facts, but not later than ten years from the date on which the product was first put into circulation. The present UK law is contained in the Limitations Act 1980, the Latent Damage Act 1986, and the Consumer Protection Act 1987.
