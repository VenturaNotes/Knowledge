- $n$. one of the threadlike structures in a cell nucleus that carry the genetic information in the form of genes. It is composed of a long double filament of DNA coiled into a helix together with associated proteins, with the genes arranged in a linear manner along its length. It stains deeply with basic dyes during cell division (see MEIOSIS; MITOSIS). The nucleus of each human somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 of which are of maternal and 23 of paternal origin (see illustration). Each chromosome can duplicate an exact copy of itself between each cell division (see INTERPHASE) so that each new cell formed receives a full set of chromosomes. See also CHROMATID; CENTROMERE; SEX CHROMOSOME. â€”chromosomal adj.
