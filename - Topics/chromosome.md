- $n$. one of the threadlike structures in a cell nucleus that carry the genetic information in the form of genes. It is composed of a long double filament of DNA coiled into a helix together with associated proteins, with the genes arranged in a linear manner along its length. It stains deeply with basic dyes during cell division (see MEIOSIS; MITOSIS). The nucleus of each human somatic cell contains 46 chromosomes, 23 of which are of maternal and 23 of paternal origin (see illustration). Each chromosome can duplicate an exact copy of itself between each cell division (see INTERPHASE) so that each new cell formed receives a full set of chromosomes. See also CHROMATID; CENTROMERE; SEX CHROMOSOME. â€”chromosomal adj.

- Chromosome. Human male chromosomes, arranged in numbered pairs according to a standard classification. The female set differs only in the sex chromosomes (XX instead of XY).
## Source[^2]
- A structure consisting of a single DNA molecule and associated proteins. Several to many chromosomes are found in the nucleus of eukaryotic cells (e.g. in plants and animals), whereas prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) have a single chromosome. Chromosomes are composed of chromatin and carry the genes in a linear sequence; these determine the individual characteristics of an organism. When the nucleus is not dividing, individual chromosomes cannot be identified with a light microscope. During the first stage of nuclear division, however, the chromosomes contract and, when stained, can be clearly seen under a microscope. Each consists of two chromatids held together at the centromere (see also MEIosis; mitosis). The number of chromosomes in each cell is constant for and characteristic of the species concerned. In the normal body cells of diploid organisms the chromosomes occur in pairs (see HOMOLOGOUS CHROMOSOMES); in the gamete-forming germ cells, however, the diploid number is halved and each cell contains only one member of each chromosome pair. Thus in humans each body cell contains 46 chromosomes ( 22 matched pairs and one pair of sex chromosomes) and each germ cell 23. Abnormalities in the number or structure of chromosomes may give rise to abnormalities in the individual; Down's syndrome is the result of one such abnormality. See CHROMOSOME MUTATION.
- Bacterial cells contain only a single circular chromosome, typically tethered to the cell's plasma membrane and highly aggregated into a nucleoid. The organelles of eukaryotes, specifically mitochondria and chloroplasts, also contain multiple copies of very small chromosomes arranged in nucleoids. Viral chromosomes can consist of one or several single-or double-stranded nucleic acid molecules (DNA or RNA). See also ARTIFICIAL CHROMOSOME.

## Source[^3]
- $n$. A microscopic rod-shaped structure in the nucleus of every cell, containing DNA that encodes the genes and determines hereditary characteristics. There are 46 chromosomes in every human somatic cell, 22 pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, whereas each of the sex cells or gametes carries only 23 chromosomes$\textemdash$one member of every pair. chromosomal adj. \[From Greek chroma color + soma a body, so called because they stain deeply with basic dyes]
