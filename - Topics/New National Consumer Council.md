- A UK statutory organization established in 2007 through a merger of the National Consumer Council and the consumer bodies for the energy and postal services; its remit is to watch over consumer interests and to speak for the consumer to the government, industry, and commerce. The council, which now operates under the name Consumer Futures, deals only with issues of policy (i.e. it does not issue consumer advice or deal with complaints). Since April 2014 it has been part of the Citizens Advice Service.
