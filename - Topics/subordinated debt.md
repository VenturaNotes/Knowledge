- A debt that can only be claimed by an unsecured creditor, in the event of a liquidation, after the claims of secured creditors have been met. In subordinated unsecured loan stocks loans are issued by such institutions as banks, in which the rights of the holders of the stock are subordinate to the interests of the depositors. Debts involving junk bonds are always subordinated to debts to banks, irrespective of whether or not they are secured.
