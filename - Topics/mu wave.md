- $n$. An EEG wave, with a frequency of $8\text{-}13$ hertz near the motor cortex, that tends to be suppressed when an individual performs a voluntary muscle movement or forms an intention to make such a movement. It is also blocked when a person watches someone else performing a voluntary action, and this effect is attributed to activity of mirror neurons. Also called the wicket rhythm. \[Named after the 12th letter of the Greek alphabet (M or $\mu$)]
