- $n$. the organ of sight: a three-layered roughly spherical structure specialized for receiving and responding to light. The outer fibrous coat consists of the sclera and the transparent cornea; the middle vascular layer comprises the choroid, ciliary body, and iris; and the inner sensory layer is the retina (see illustration).

- Light enters the eye through the cornea, which refracts the light through the aqueous humour onto the lens. By adjustment of the shape of the lens (see ACCOMMODATION) light is focused through the vitreous humour onto the retina. In the retina light-sensitive cells (see CONE; ROD) send nerve impulses to the brain via the optic nerve. The arrangement of the two eyes at the front of the head provides binocular vision. Each eye is contained in an orbit, and movement of the eye within the orbit is controlled by extrinsic eye muscles (see illustration).

- The organ of sight. The most primitive eyes are the eyespots of some unicellular organisms. More advanced eyes are the ocelli and compound eyes of arthropods (e.g. insects). The cephalopod molluscs (e.g. the octopus and squid) and vertebrates possess the most highly developed eyes (see illustration). These normally occur in pairs, are nearly spherical, and filled with fluid. Light is refracted by the cornea through the pupil in the iris and onto the lens, which focuses images onto the retina. These images are received by lightsensitive cells in the retina (see CONE; ROD), which transmit impulses to the brain via the optic nerve.
