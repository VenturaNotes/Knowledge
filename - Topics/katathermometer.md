- $n$. a thermometer used to measure the cooling power of the air surrounding it, having its bulb covered with water-moistened material. The instrument is brought to a steady temperature of $100^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ and then exposed to the air. The time taken for the temperature recorded by the thermometer to fall to $95^{\circ} \mathrm{F}$ gives an index of the air's cooling power.
