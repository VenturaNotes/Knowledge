- Hadoop is an open-source software framework and a collection of software tools that supports the storage and processing of big data within a distributed computing environment. As a framework, its modules assume hardware failures happen often and these failures should be handled automatically. As software, Hadoop allows users to 'cluster' multiple computers that sometimes contain as much as petabytes of data instead of using one computer to process and store datasets. That allows users to analyze data in 'parallel' (across multiple systems) quickly. Hadoop also enables users to scale clusters of computers so they can handle limitless data-related tasks concurrently.
