## Source [^1]
- (in molecular biology) An aggregate molecule that consists of two or more component molecules, which may or may not be identical, held together by noncovalent bonds. For example, many proteins comprise distinct polypeptide subunits arranged to give a specific quaternary structure. Multimers can be named variously according to the number of constituent subunits; hence, a dimer has two subunits, a trimer has three, a tetramer four, and so on.
