## Source[^2]
- (1) (speculative risk) A possibility of financial loss (whether in absolute terms or relative to expectations) that is inseparable from the opportunity for financial gain. Some of the major categories are market risk, credit risk, liquidity risk, and operational risk. Market risk arises from changes in prices in financial markets. Credit risk relates to non-payment of obligations or credit impairment. Liquidity risk is that of running out of cash or problems with asset enhancement. Operational risk is a catch-all category that covers a firm's internal systems and processes, as well as external events. See also COUNTERPARTY RISK; EXCHANGE-RATE EXPOSURE; INTEREST-RATE RISK; SPECIFIC RISK; SYSTEMATIC RISK. 
- (2) (peril; pure risk) The possibility of suffering some form of loss or damage where there is no corresponding opportunity for gain. Risks of this kind - e.g. fire, theft, or accident - are the proper domain of insurance cover. See INSURABLE RISK.
