- insidious numbness in muscles that develops 15-20 years after an attack of poliomyelitis; the muscles may or may not have been previously affected. It may be caused by loss of nerve cells that have been under greater strain than normal as a result of the polio; there is no evidence of reactivation of the poliovirus. The syndrome also includes other symptoms, such as fatigue and pain, which may be due to secondary mechanical causes.
