- (logon) The process by which a user identifies herself or himself to a system. The terms are also used as verbs: log in, log on, or sign on. A system with many registered users will require each user to log in, and to produce some form of authentication (such as a password) before allowing the user access to system resources. The login activity may also open an accounting file for the session.
