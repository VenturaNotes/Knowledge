- A bank in the USA that is authorized to operate as a bank by a charter granted either by its home state (state-chartered bank) or by the federal government (nationally chartered bank). In Canada, a similar charter is granted to banks by the Comptroller of Currency. The use of charters dates back to the use of Royal Charters, which predated Acts of Parliament.
