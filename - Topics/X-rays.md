## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- pl. n. electromagnetic radiation of extremely short wavelength (beyond the ultraviolet), which pass through matter to varying degrees depending on its density. X-rays are produced when high-energy beams of electrons strike matter. They are physically indistinguishable from gamma rays, produced during radioactive decay. Both are used in diagnostic radiology (see RADIOGRAPHY; NUCLEAR MEDICINE) and in radiotherapy. Great care is needed to avoid unnecessary exposure, because the radiation is harmful to all living things (see IONIZATION; RADIATION SICKNESS). Heavy elements, such as lead and barium, tend to stop X-rays and can be used to shield people from unwanted exposure to ionizing radiation.
## Source[^2]
- Electromagnetic radiation of shorter wavelength than ultraviolet radiation and longer wavelength than gamma radiation. The range of wavelengths is $10^{-11} \mathrm{~m}$ to $10^{-9} \mathrm{~m}$. X-rays can pass through many forms of matter and they are therefore used medically and industrially to examine internal structures. X-rays are produced for these purposes by an X-ray tube.
