- A celebrated example of communication in animals, first investigated by Austrian zoologist Karl von Frisch (1886-1982). Honeybee workers on returning to the hive after a successful foraging expedition perform a 'dance' on the comb that contains coded information about the distance and direction of the food source. For example the waggle dance, characterized by tail-wagging movements, indicates the direction and distance of a food source. Performing on the wall of the hive, the bee traces a half-circle in one direction, then a straight run during which it waggles its abdomen, then another half-circle to complete the circle. The direction of the dance, and the angle of the straight run to the vertical, indicate the direction of the food source in relation to the sun, while the number of waggles during the straight run indicates the distance from the hive. Other workers, called followers, sensing vibrations and other cues from the dance, follow the instructions to find the food source.
