- (AV node) a mass of modified heart muscle situated in the lower middle part of the right atrium. It receives the impulse to contract from the sinoatrial node, via the atria, and transmits it through the atrioventricular bundle to the ventricles.
## Source[^2]
- (AVN) A specialized group of cardiac muscle fibres situated in the fibrous ring between the right atrium and ventricle of the heart. The AVN is the only pathway between the atria and the ventricles through which electrical impulses can pass. Thus, following the contraction of the atria, the AVN initiates a wave of contraction in the ventricles via the bundle of His.
