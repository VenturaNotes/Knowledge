- Multitenancy is a term used to describe a situation where software is launched using a server and provides service to multiple different clients (or tenants). One of the best examples of multitenancy is SaaS (Software-as-a-Service) platforms. Through a cloud-based environment, many users can access the same resources on the same server. Alternatively, they can opt for a single-tenant architecture. This is generally more expensive; however, it does offer additional data security measures.
