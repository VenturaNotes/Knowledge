- $n$. A two-person game in which each player chooses between a cooperative $C$ strategy (2) and a defecting $D$ strategy, each receiving a higher payoff from $D$ than $C$ irrespective of whether the other player chooses $C$ or $D$, but each receiving a higher payoff if both choose $C$ than if both choose $D$. Its name derives from an interpretation first applied to it by the US mathematician Albert W(illiam) Tucker (1905-95) in a seminar at the Psychology Department of Stanford University in 1950: Two people, charged with involvement in a serious crime, are arrested and prevented from communicating with each other. There is insufficient evidence to obtain a conviction unless at least one of them discloses incriminating information, and each prisoner has to choose between concealing the information $(C)$ and disclosing it $(D)$. If both conceal, both will be acquitted, the second-best payoff for each; if both disclose, both will be convicted, the third-best payoff for each; and if only one discloses and one conceals, then according to a deal offered to them, the one who discloses will be acquitted and will receive a reward for helping the police, the best possible payoff, and the other will receive an especially heavy sentence from the court, the worst possible payoff. The game is paradoxical, because $D$ is a dominant strategy for both players, so that it is rational for each player to choose it whatever the other player does, but each player receives a higher payoff if they both choose their dominated $C$ strategies than if they both choose $D$. The game was discovered in 1950 by the US mathematician Merrill M(eeks) Flood (1908-91) and the Polish-born US mathematician Melvin Dresher (1911-92).
