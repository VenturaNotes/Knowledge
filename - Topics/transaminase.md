## Source [^1]
- $n$. an enzyme that catalyses the transfer of an amino group from an amino acid to an $\alpha$-keto acid in the process of transamination. Examples include aspartate aminotransferase (AST), which catalyses the transamination of glutamate and oxaloacetate to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and aspartate, and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), converting glutamate and pyruvate to $\alpha$-ketoglutarate and alanine.

- An enzyme that catalyses the transfer of an amino group from one molecule to another. Transaminases play an important role in the synthesis of amino acids (see TRANSAMINATION).
