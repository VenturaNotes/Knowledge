- (1) In telecommunications in general, a separate path through which signals can flow. 
- (2) In the public switched telephone network (PSTN), one of multiple transmission paths within a single link between network points. 
- (3) In mainframe parlance, a specialized processor that comprises an information route and associated circuitry to control input and/or output operations. It normally provides for formatting and buffering and has the necessary control to meet the timing requirements of an I/O device.
- Several different I/O devices may be connected to one channel and the control circuitry within the channel directs the data streams to or from the appropriate device. If the I/O devices have a relatively slow data rate, then a [[multiplexer channel]] is used in which transfers to or from the separate devices are interleaved, character by character, such that several devices can work simultaneously.
- When a number of devices with high data rates, e.g. magnetic disk and tape, are to be connected, a [[selector channel]] is used. This will transfer a complete record to or from a device before reselecting.
- A channel is often a wired-program processor. As channels have become more elaborate they have tended to become programmed computers (I/O processors) in themselves. See also PERIPHERAL PROCESSOR. 
- (4) A greyscale digital image equivalent to one of the components of a color image. For example, an RGB image consists of red, green, and blue channels. 
- (5) On the World Wide Web, a pre-defined website that can automatically send updated information for immediate display or viewing on request. 
- (6) In computer marketing, a 'middleman' between a product creator and the marketplace. This is distinct from direct selling where the manufacturer sells directly to the end user. Value-added resellers (VAR) and retail store chains are examples of channels in this context. 
- (7) In a field-effect transistor (FET), the path in the semiconductor through which current flows.
