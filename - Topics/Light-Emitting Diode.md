- Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are small electrical components that emit light. They work by combining complementing types of semiconductors. LEDs are traditionally used to indicate the status of equipment. They may show if a device is on, off, or in standby mode. Several LEDs may indicate a level of input or output, such as volume on a mixing desk. Many car dashboards also use LEDs to indicate speed or distance traveled. In recent years, LEDs have been adopted as an energy-saving alternative to incandescent and fluorescent lightbulbs.
