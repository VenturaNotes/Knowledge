- a combined vaccine against measles, mumps, and German measles (rubella). It is currently recommended that this vaccine is given to all children at 12 months of age with a booster dose at 3 years 4 months of age or soon after (see IMMUNIZATION). Specific contraindications include immunosuppression and allergy to eggs. Claims of a link between the vaccine and autism and Crohn's disease have been investigated and no credible evidence for such a relationship has been found.
