- $n$. any one of a group of gastrointestinal hormones that cause a decrease in blood glucose levels by stimulating an enhanced release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells after eating. Thus they help to regulate the rise in blood glucose levels after eating and they have some additional actions that can enhance satiety - through effects on the brain and through gastrointestinal effects, such as delayed gastric emptying. Incretin-based drugs mimic the effects of the incretin glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). They include GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-IV inhibitors.
