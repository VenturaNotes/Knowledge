- $n$. Either of two clusters of neuron cell bodies and opiate receptors in the basal forebrain near the septum pellucidum, where dopamine-secreting neurons originating in the ventral tegmental area terminate. This dopamine pathway is thought to be involved in reward and reinforcement (1) and appears to be implicated in most if not all addictions. It is also involved in attention. Also called the accumbens nucleus. See also INCENTIVE-SENSITIZATION THEORY.
