- A forecast of the financial requirements for the future trading of an organization, including its planned sales, production, cash flow, etc. An operating budget is normally designed for a fixed period, usually one year, and forms the plan for that period's trading activities. Any divergences from it are usually monitored and, if appropriate, changes can then be made to it as the period progresses. See BUDGETARY CONTROL.
