- (intragroup transactions) Transactions between the companies in a group. These may be in the form of charges or the transfer of goods or services. It is important in the preparation of consolidated financial statements that such transactions are eliminated or suitable adjustments made as they do not reflect transactions between the group and external parties. See also CONSOLIDATION.
