- In a topological space, a Borel set is a set which can be obtained, from the set of open sets, by countable unions and relative complement. Consequently, by De Morgan's Laws, the set of Borel sets is closed under countable intersections. The Borel sets form a sigma algebra, in fact the sigma algebra generated by the topology.
