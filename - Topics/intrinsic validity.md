- $n$. In psychometrics, a form of validity that is said to exist when the test items necessarily or inherently measure the construct in question. For example, a test to measure children's ability to recognize and name letters of the alphabet has intrinsic validity if it involves presenting each of the letters in turn and asking the child to try to name it. The line between intrinsic validity on the one hand and face validity or consensual validity on the other is often blurred.
