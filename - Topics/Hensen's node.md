## Source[^2]
- (primitive node; primitive knot) A group of cells that acts as an organizer of development in the early embryo of birds and mammals. It is located immediately anterior to the primitive streak in a developing gastrula and is analogous to the dorsal lip of the blastopore in the blastula of an amphibian embryo. Named after its discoverer, German zoologist Victor Hensen (1835-1924), it controls gastrulation by secreting diffusible protein signals, initiating a signaling cascade in surrounding cells that regulates the differentiation of such structures as the neural tube and notochord.
