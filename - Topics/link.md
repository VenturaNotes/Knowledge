## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (1) To join together two or more separately compiled program modules, usually with additional library modules, to form an executable program. See also LINK EDITOR. 
- (2) (linkage) A part of a program, possibly a single instruction or address, that passes control and parameters between separate portions of the program. The instruction, address, etc., links the separate portions. 
- (3) (pointer) A character or group of characters that indicates the storage of an item of data. Thus when a field of an item A in a data structure contains the address of another item B, i.e. of its first word in memory, it contains a link to B. Two items are linked when one has a link to the other. An important case is the link left pointing into the calling code by the call of a subroutine, i.e. the value of the program counter at the point of call. See also LINKED LIST. 
- (4) A word or phrase in a hypertext document that when selected in some way leads the user to another part of the document or to a different document. 
- (5) (line) A path for communication that may be physical (as in a circuit) or either physical or logical (as in a channel). See also DATA LINK.
## Source[^2]
- The term link is shorthand for hyperlink. A hyperlink is a word or phrase on a web page that web users can click to easily jump to another section of the same web page or to a web page on a different website. Most links usually take the form of underlined text. With this being said, web developers are able to render web links using whatever format they choose, whether underlined or not. Content strategists often use links to encourage website browsers to navigate to another part of their organization ªs webpage. Other times, content writers use links to guide web page or social media platform browsers to a resource on an external website.
