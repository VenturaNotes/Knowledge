## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- The amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another across a network, essentially measuring the delay in communication between two devices
	- A network with high latency experiences noticeable [[lag]]
	- A low latency network provide fast response times

## Source[^2]
- (1) A measure of how long it takes for a given job or piece of work to be completed, or for a message to make its way from source to destination. See also THROUGHPUT. 
- (2) The time taken for the start of a given sector of data on a storage disk to reach the read/write head. The time is measured from the instant that the head settles at the track within which the sector lies. The average latency is the time for half a revolution of the disk. See also ACCESS TIME, SEEK TIME.
