## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The amount of time it takes for data to travel from one point to another across a network, essentially measuring the delay in communication between two devices
	- A network with high latency experiences noticeable [[lag]]
	- A low latency network provide fast response times

## Source[^2]
- (1) A measure of how long it takes for a given job or piece of work to be completed, or for a message to make its way from source to destination. See also THROUGHPUT. 
- (2) The time taken for the start of a given sector of data on a storage disk to reach the read/write head. The time is measured from the instant that the head settles at the track within which the sector lies. The average latency is the time for half a revolution of the disk. See also ACCESS TIME, SEEK TIME.
## Source[^3]
- Latency refers to the delay time it takes for data to travel from one location to another in a network, such as a computer to a printer. A network with low latency is fast, and a network with high latency is slow. Latency is measured in milliseconds, and latency thresholds have shrunk over time. This has occurred as technology and computers have become more and more responsive. Latency is affected by various factors, including the speed and bandwidth of a network.
