- $n$. an emotional state evoked by the threat of danger and usually characterized by unpleasant subjective experiences as well as physiological and behavioural changes. Fear is often distinguished from anxiety in having a specific object. Associated physiological changes can include increases in heart rate, blood pressure, sweating, etc. Behavioural changes can include an avoidance of fear-producing objects or situations and may be extremely disabling. Specific disabling fears are known as phobias. Beta blockers relieve the physiological manifestations of fear and are useful in the treatment of short-term fears, such as the fear of hearing the results of an examination. Behavior therapy or cognitive behavioral therapy are treatments for disabling and persistent fears.
