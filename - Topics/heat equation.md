- The heat equation states that the temperature $T(x,t)$ in a uniform, solid medium satisfies the parabolic PDE $$\frac{\partial T}{\partial t} = \kappa \frac{\partial^2T}{\partial x^2},$$where $\kappa$ denotes the thermal diffusivity of the medium. In more than one spatial dimension the second derivative is replaced by the Laplacian $\nabla^2T$, and if $\kappa$ is not constant, then the RHS is replaced with $div(\kappa \nabla T)$. The equation models diffusion more generally, for example that of particles, and so is often referred to as the diffusion equation
