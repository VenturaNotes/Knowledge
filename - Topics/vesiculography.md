- $n$. any technique for imaging the seminal vesicles. This used to be performed by injecting a contrast medium into the vas deferens during vasography. More commonly direct injection is now performed during transrectal ultrasonography (TRUS), enabling sperm to be sampled at the same examination. Injected contrast medium or dye should be seen draining into the vas deferens to the bladder if there is no blockage. Magnetic resonance imaging is a good technique for imaging the seminal vesicles with no radiation exposure. Both these techniques are useful for investigation of patients with azoospermia.
