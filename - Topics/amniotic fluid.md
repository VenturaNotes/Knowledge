- the fluid contained within the amniotic cavity. It surrounds the growing fetus, protecting it from external pressure. The fluid is initially secreted from the amnion and is later supplemented by urine from the fetal kidneys. Some of the fluid is swallowed by the fetus and absorbed through its intestine. The volume of amniotic fluid varies according to the stage of gestation: approximate normal values are 500 ml at 18 weeks, rising to a maximum of 800 ml at 34 weeks and falling to 600 ml at term.
