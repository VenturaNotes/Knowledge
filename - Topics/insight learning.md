## Source [^1]
- A form of learning in which an animal responds to new situations by adapting experiences gained in other contexts. Insight learning requires an animal to solve problems by viewing a situation as a whole instead of relying wholly on trial-and-error learning. Chimpanzees are capable of insight learning. See LEARNING IN ANIMALS (Feature).
