- (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) A disease of humans characterized by defective cell-mediated immunity and increased susceptibility to infections. It is caused by the retrovirus HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). This infects and destroys helper T cells, which are essential for combating infections. HIV is transmitted in blood, semen, and vaginal fluid; the major routes of infection are unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse, intravenous drug abuse, and the administration of contaminated blood and blood products. A person infected with HIV is described as HIV-positive; after the initial infection the virus can remain generally dormant for up to ten years before AIDS develops. Antiretroviral therapy (ART), which involves a combination of antiviral drugs drawn from several classes, including reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g. zidovudine, lamivudine), protease inhibitors, fusion and entry inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors, can enable HIV-positive individuals to lead long and healthy lives.

- abbrev. Acquired immune (or immuno-) deficiency syndrome, a disorder believed to be caused by the HIV retrovirus and transmitted by infected blood entering the body, especially through transfusion or the sharing of needles by injecting drug users, by sexual intercourse, or from a mother to her unborn child via the placenta. It is characterized by destruction of T lymphocytes and consequent loss of immunity to opportunistic infections. Almost half of all AIDS patients develop HIV dementia. Also written as Aids.
