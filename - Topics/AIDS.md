- (acquired immune deficiency syndrome) A disease of humans characterized by defective cell-mediated immunity and increased susceptibility to infections. It is caused by the retrovirus HIV (human immunodeficiency virus). This infects and destroys helper T cells, which are essential for combating infections. HIV is transmitted in blood, semen, and vaginal fluid; the major routes of infection are unprotected vaginal and anal intercourse, intravenous drug abuse, and the administration of contaminated blood and blood products. A person infected with HIV is described as HIV-positive; after the initial infection the virus can remain generally dormant for up to ten years before AIDS develops. Antiretroviral therapy (ART), which involves a combination of antiviral drugs drawn from several classes, including reverse transcriptase inhibitors (e.g. zidovudine, lamivudine), protease inhibitors, fusion and entry inhibitors, and integrase inhibitors, can enable HIV-positive individuals to lead long and healthy lives.
