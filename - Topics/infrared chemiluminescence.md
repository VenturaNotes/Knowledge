## Synthesis

- A technique for studying chemical reaction mechanisms by measuring and analyzing weak infrared emissions from product molecules formed in certain chemical reactions. If products are formed with excess energy, this appears as excited vibrational states of the molecules, which decay with emission of infrared radiation. Spectroscopic investigation of this radiation gives information about the states in which the product molecules were formed.
