- $n$. One of the sensory registers, supposedly allowing an auditory image to persist for up to two seconds after its stimulus has ceased, making speech intelligible and enabling sound localization with the use of binaural time differences between the arrival of the sound at the two ears, although there is controversy regarding its existence. Also called echoic memory. See also PRECATEGORICAL ACOUSTIC STORE, SENSORY MEMORY. Compare ICONIC STORE. \[From Greek echo a sound + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
