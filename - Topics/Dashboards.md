- In business intelligence and analytics, a dashboard is a graphical user interface that displays multiple data visualizations (e.g. graphs, bar charts, or pie charts) within a single panel. Like the dashboard in a vehicle, dashboards for data reporting seek to give users the most crucial information at a glance. This may include employee performance, efficiency and productivity rates, customer satisfaction, sales figures, or other metrics. Dashboard users can typically customize the visualizations that they see, as well as the sources from which these visualizations pull data.
