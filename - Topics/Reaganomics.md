- The policy combination of tight monetary policy to discourage inflation, and lax public finance to encourage real growth. This policy mix is named in recognition of its use in the United States during the presidency of Ronald Reagan (1911-2004). It led to large deficits in both the US government budget and the US balance of payments on current account.
