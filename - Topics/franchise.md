- (1) A licence given to a manufacturer, distributor, trader, etc., to enable them to manufacture or sell a named product or service in a particular area for a stated period. The holder of the licence (franchisee) usually pays the grantor of the licence (franchisor) a royalty on sales, often with a lump sum as an advance against royalties. The franchisor may also supply the franchisee with a brand identity as well as finance and technical expertise. Franchises are common in the fast-food business, petrol stations, travel agents, etc. 
- (2) A clause in an insurance policy, often a marine-insurance policy, that excludes the payment of claims up to a specified level but agrees to pay in full all claims above it. For example, a $£ 50$ franchise would mean that insurers would not deal with claims below $£ 50$ but a claim for $£ 51$ would be met in full. Franchise clauses are used by insurers to avoid administratively expensive small claims, while still providing the policyholder with full cover for larger claims. See also EXCESS POLICY.
