- (1) A licence given to a manufacturer, distributor, trader, etc., to enable them to manufacture or sell a named product or service in a particular area for a stated period. The holder of the licence (franchisee) usually pays the grantor of the licence (franchisor) a royalty on sales, often with a lump sum as an advance against royalties. The franchisor may also supply the franchisee with a brand identity as well as finance and technical expertise. Franchises are common in the fast-food business, petrol stations, travel agents, etc. 
- (2) A clause in an insurance policy, often a marine-insurance policy, that excludes the payment of claims up to a specified level but agrees to pay in full all claims above it. For example, a $£ 50$ franchise would mean that insurers would not deal with claims below $£ 50$ but a claim for $£ 51$ would be met in full. Franchise clauses are used by insurers to avoid administratively expensive small claims, while still providing the policyholder with full cover for larger claims. See also EXCESS POLICY.

- (1) The system by which independent firms are authorized to use a common business system. This may include the use of a brand name, designs, patents, and operating systems, and provision of equipment, training, capital, or credit by the franchiser. This system combines the advantages of incentive for the operating firms and economies of scale in research, development, and advertising for the franchiser. The holders of franchises are subject to supervision of their operations in order to maintain the reputation of the franchised product.
- (2) The civil right to vote. Also known as suffrage. Universal suffrage still remains a relatively recent development. All women were only granted the right to vote in the UK in 1928. Universal suffrage was adopted by the US in 1920 but not enforced until the Civil Rights Act of 1964.
