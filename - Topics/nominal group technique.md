## Synthesis

- (NGT) A group problem-solving technique in which each member of the group is asked to write down a list of ideas without talking to their colleagues. The ideas elicited in this way are then discussed and criticized by the group, who are not told which members contributed which ideas. Similar ideas are grouped or merged; when the discussion has finished the panel ranks the remaining ideas, again without discussion. The individual rankings are then combined mathematically to find the favored solution, which is adopted. The NGT is intended to eliminate such problems of group decision making as groupthink, deference to authority, political manoeuvring, and personal likes or dislikes.
