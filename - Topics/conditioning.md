- $n$. the establishment of new behavior by modifying the stimulus/response associations. In classical conditioning a stimulus not normally associated with a particular response is presented together with the stimulus that evokes the response automatically. This is repeated until the first stimulus evokes the response by itself (see CONDITIONED REFLEX). In operant conditioning a response is rewarded (or punished) each time it occurs, so that in time it comes to occur more (or less) frequently (see REINFORCEMENT).
