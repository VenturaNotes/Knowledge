- $n$. the establishment of new behavior by modifying the stimulus/response associations. In classical conditioning a stimulus not normally associated with a particular response is presented together with the stimulus that evokes the response automatically. This is repeated until the first stimulus evokes the response by itself (see CONDITIONED REFLEX). In operant conditioning a response is rewarded (or punished) each time it occurs, so that in time it comes to occur more (or less) frequently (see REINFORCEMENT).

- A process by which animals learn about a relation between two events. In classical (or Pavlovian) conditioning, repeated presentations of a neutral stimulus (e.g. the sound of a bell or buzzer) are followed each time by a biologically important stimulus (such as food or electric shock), which elicits a response (e.g. salivation). Eventually the neutral stimulus presented by itself produces a response (the conditional response, or conditioned reflex) similar to that originally evoked by the biologically important stimulus. For example, Pavlov's dogs learned to salivate in response to the sound of a metronome that preceded the presentation of food. In instrumental (or operant) conditioning the animal is rewarded (or punished) each time it makes a particular response; this eventually causes the frequency of the response to increase (or decrease). For example, a rat will learn to press a lever in order to obtain food. See LEARNING (Feature); REINFORCEMENT.
