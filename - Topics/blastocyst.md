- $n$. an early stage of embryonic development that consists of a hollow ball of cells with a localized thickening (the inner cell mass) that will develop into the actual embryo; the remainder of the blastocyst is composed of trophoblast (see illustration). At first the blastocyst is unattached, but it soon implants in the wall of the uterus. See also IMPLANTATION.
