- 5G is the latest upgrade to the cellular network and aims to replace the former 4G network. Like upgrades in the past, 5G is capable of higher data transmission speeds. The average speed of 5G is around 100 times faster than 4G at 10 gigabits per second. While the cellular network has traditionally received an upgrade every 10 years, this upgrade is focused on much more than supporting cell phones. It also aims to support a host of smart devices and support more devices in one area than previous generations of wireless connectivity were capable of.
