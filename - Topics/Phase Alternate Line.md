- Phase alternate line is a television broadcasting system used in many parts of the world, including Europe and Asia. It's also known as "PAL." The PAL standard was developed in 1963 as an upgrade to NTSC, its predecessor. Compared to NTSC, PAL offers better color fidelity and improved picture quality overall.
