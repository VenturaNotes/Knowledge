## Source [^1]
- A simple approach to forecasting future trends (e.g. the demand for a product) in which an average value is obtained from historical data and it is assumed that the same average will obtain for values in the future. No attempt is made to establish a causal relationship between variables, or to use such techniques as e.g. adaptive exponential smoothing to reduce the effect of seasonal or cyclic variations within time series data. Compare CAUSAL QUANTITATIVE MODELS.
