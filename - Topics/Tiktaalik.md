- An extinct genus of lobe-finned fish whose fossils display features of both fish and four-legged (tetrapod) animals; hence its nickname 'fishapod'. It was first discovered at a site in the Canadian Arctic and dated to 375 million years ago, some 10 million years earlier than the first known tetrapods. Like its fish relatives, Tiktaalik had prominent pectoral and pelvic fins, gills, and lungs, and was covered in scales. However, it also possessed adaptations suggestive of an amphibious lifestyle, such as a flattened head with eyes on top and a functional neck. A full set of ribs and robust limbs enabled it to breathe air and prop itself up in shallow waters. Also, the bones of the front fins have the same pattern, including a wrist, found in all limbed animals.
