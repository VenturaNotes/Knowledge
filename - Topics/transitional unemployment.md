- Unemployment due to a major change in the way an economy is organized. This could apply to conversion from a wartime to a peacetime economy, industrialization of less developed countries, or a shift from central planning to a market economy. In any major change it is likely that managers and skilled workers will be needed to set up new systems and production facilities earlier than less skilled workers are needed to operate them. The less skilled are thus liable to suffer from unemployment during the transitional period.
