- (of a connected graph G) A vertex of G whose removal together with the removal of all edges incident to it results in the remaining graph being disconnected. The term can also be extended and applied to more general graphs. Then the removal of a cut vertex and all arcs incident to it increases the number of connected components of the graph. See also CONNECTIVITY.
