- $n$. a technique used in behavior modification to elicit a response not previously present. The subject is made to engage passively in the required behavior by instructions or by being physically put through the movements. The behavior can then be rewarded (see REINFORCEMENT). This is followed by fading, in which the prompting is gradually withdrawn and the reinforcement maintained.
