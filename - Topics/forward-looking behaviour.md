- Economic agents engage in forward-looking behavior when they form their expectations based on the structure of the economy and its expected future time path. When agents are forward-looking, the announcement of a future policy change can alter the expectations of the agents and, through their response, change the way the economy evolves from the time of the announcement, provided that the announcement is credible.
