- Perpetual software licenses allow program users to utilize a specific version of a software solution continuously over time by paying a one-time fee. Software vendors that offer perpetual licenses typically provide their software buyers with a limited window of time to seek technical support. Often, buyers that purchase perpetual licenses must pay a fee if they wish to update their software solution. When compared to subscription-based licenses, perpetual software licensing options seem to be losing their popularity due to its higher initial cost.
