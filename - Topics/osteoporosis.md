- $n$. a bone disease characterized by a decrease in bone mineral density and bone mass, resulting in bones that are liable to fracture. Infection, injury, and synovitis can cause localized osteoporosis of adjacent bone. Generalized osteoporosis is common in older people, and in women it often follows the menopause. It is also a feature of Cushing's syndrome and prolonged steroid therapy. Osteoporosis can be detected by quantitative digital radiography, ultrasound, and DEXA scans. A diet with adequate calcium, together with exercise, are preventative, and several drugs, including bisphosphonates, parathyroid hormone (PTH), and denosumab, can be used to reduce the risk of fracture.
