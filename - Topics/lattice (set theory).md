- A partially ordered set X in which every pair of elements x, y has a least upper bound $x \lor y$ and a greatest lower bound $x \land y$. The lattice is complete if every subset of X has a least upper bound and greatest lower bound. A power set with $\lor = \cup$ and $\land = \cap$ is a complete lattice. $\mathbb{N}$ with $\le = |$ (divides), $\land$ = [[least common multiple|lcm]], and $\land$ = [[Greatest Common Divisor|hcf]] is an incomplete lattice as the elements of $\mathbb{N}$ have no upper bound
