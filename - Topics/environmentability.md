- $n$. The proportion of the variance in a phenotypic trait explained by, attributable to, or shared with environmental variance in a specified population at a particular time, and symbolized by $e^{2}$. If environmental variance is $V_{\mathrm{E}}$ and total phenotypic variance is $V_{\mathrm{P}}$, then $e^{2}=$ $V_{\mathrm{E}} / V_{\mathrm{P}}$. Also called environmentality. Compare heritability. \[Formed from environment by analogy with heritability]
