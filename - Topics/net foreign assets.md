- The total of assets owned by residents of a country, but situated abroad, less assets located within the country but owned by nonresidents. A country's overseas assets include both foreign direct investment and holdings of foreign securities, and foreign holdings of domestic assets include both inward foreign direct investment and foreign holdings of domestic securities. Net foreign assets can thus be either positive or negative.
