- $n$. An approach to the mind-body problem that is a form of dualism and one-way interactionism (1), assuming as it does that mental experiences are real but are merely trivial by-products or epiphenomena of one particular class of physical brain processes, real but incidental, like the smoke rising above a factory, so that physical processes can cause mental experiences but not vice versa. Compare PSYCHOPHYSICAL PARALLELISM. \[From Greek epi on + phainein to show + -ismos indicating a state or condition]
