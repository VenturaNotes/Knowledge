## Synthesis
- Encoding a string means to convert it from a sequence of abstract characters (like Unicode characters) into a sequence of bytes, using a specific encoding scheme (like UTF-8, UTF-16, ASCII, etc.). 
	- #question How does this encoding scheme work?
	- #question What is an encoding scheme and can you build your own?
	- #question Give specific examples of how an encoding scheme is built
	- #question What would the sequence of bytes be? Would it be just 0s and 1s? 
	- #question How big is a byte? 
- Computers fundamentally store and process data as [[byte|bytes]] (binary data). When you have text, it needs to be converted into this byte format for storage, transmission over a network, or processing by certain functions
	- #question What is binary data? 
	- #question Why does it need to be converted into a byte format for storage, transmission over a network, or processing certain functions? Why can't you just have text as is?
	- #question What certain functions process bytes?
- Different encoding schemes represent the same characters with different byte sequences.
	- #question I would like to see some variations of this

- (2) The representation of symbols in some alphabet by symbols or strings of symbols in some other alphabet. A common example is binary encoding.
