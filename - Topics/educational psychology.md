- $n$. A field of applied psychology related to the education and emotional and social well-being of children and young people. In the US, educational psychologists are trained in education rather than psychology, and they work mainly as counselors in universities and colleges. In the UK they are trained in child development, the psychology of learning and teaching, and the psychological aspects of assessing and educating children with special needs; many are employed by Local Authority departments but some directly by schools, voluntary bodies, or parents. Similar work is called school psychology in the US. EP abbrev.
