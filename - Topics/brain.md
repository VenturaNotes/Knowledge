## Synthesis
### Organize
- Employs several organizational principles to process and make sense of sensory information, allowing us to perceive a coherent world. Many of these principles fall under the umbrella of Gestalt principles of perceptual organization, which describe how the brain groups individual elements into larger, meaningful wholes.

- $n$. the enlarged and highly developed mass of nervous tissue that forms the upper end of the central nervous system (see illustration). The average adult human brain weighs about 1400 g (approximately $2 \%$ of total body weight) and is continuous below with the spinal cord. It is invested by three connective tissue membranes, the meninges, and floats in cerebrospinal fluid within the rigid casing formed by the bones of the skull. The brain is divided into the hindbrain (rhombencephalon), consisting of the medulla oblongata, pons, and cerebellum; the midbrain (mesencephalon); and the forebrain (prosencephalon), subdivided into the cerebrum and the diencephalon (including the thalamus and hypothalamus). The brain is usually considered to be the site of the working of the mind, but to what extent the concepts of 'brain' and 'mind' are interchangeable is a matter of debate and of concern to anyone facing brain surgery. Anatomical name: encephalon.

- (1) The enlarged anterior part of the vertebrate central nervous system, which is encased within the cranium of the skull. Continuous with the spinal cord, the brain is surrounded by three membranes (see MENINGES) and bathed in cerebrospinal fluid, which fills internal cavities (ventricles). It functions as the main coordinating center for nervous activity, receiving information (in the form of nerve impulses) from sense organs, interpreting it, and transmitting 'instructions' to muscles and other effectors. It is also the seat of intelligence and memory. The embryonic vertebrate brain is in three sections (see FOREBRAIN; HINDBRAIN; MIDBRAIN), which become further differentiated during development into specialized regions. The main parts of the adult human brain are a highly developed cerebrum in the form of two cerebral hemispheres, a cerebellum, hypothalamus, and the brainstem comprising the medulla oblongata, pons, midbrain, and reticular formation (see illustration).

- $n$. The part of the central nervous system that is enclosed within the skull, comprising, from the top down, the cerebrum, midbrain, cerebellum, pons, and medulla oblongata. The remainder of the central nervous system is the spinal cord. The adult human brain weighs 1,300-1,400 grams (about 3 pounds), contains about 80 billion neurons (50 billion of them in the cerebral cortex), each typically forming synapses (1) with hundreds or thousands of other neurons, and consumes about 20 per cent of the body's total oxygen intake. See also cerebral cortex. \[From Old English brægen a brain, cognate with Greek bregma the front part of the head]
