- n. 
- (1) the space within a tubular or sac-like part, such as a blood vessel, the intestine, or the stomach. 
- (2) the SI unit of luminous flux, equal to the amount of light emitted per second in unit solid angle of 1 steradian by a point source of 1 candela. Symbol: lm.
## Source[^2]
- (pl. lumina) 
- (1) The space enclosed by a vessel, duct, or other tubular or saclike organ. The central cavity of blood vessels and of the digestive tract are examples.

## Source[^3]
- n. 
- (1) A unit of luminous intensity, equal to the luminous flux emitted or reflected in a solid angle of one steradian (a stereo radian or solid angle with its vertex at the center of a sphere cutting off an area of the sphere's surface equal to the square of its radius) by a point source having a uniform intensity of one candela. See also BRIL, FOOT-CANDLE. Im abbrev. 
- (2) A cavity within an organ, such as any of the hollows within the central nervous system filled with cerebrospinal fluid, including the cerebral ventricles and the central canal of the spinal cord. \[From Latin lumen light or aperture]
