- A cloud management platform (CMP) is a dedicated software application that enables businesses to oversee and control their multi-cloud environments, including public, private and, hybrid cloud. With companies using a growing number of cloud services from a wider range of providers, CMPs seek to help manage and rein in this complexity. The functionality of CMPs will depend heavily on the implementation. Possible features include cloud metering and billing, provisioning new system images, managing system resources, automating and optimizing cloud workloads, and helping to address issues of data governance and compliance.
