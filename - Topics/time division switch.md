- An all-electronic switching system based on time division multiplexing (TDM) principles: an input digitized signal from a source is connected to an output trunk by assigning a group of bits from the input data stream to a time slot in a high-speed TDM output data stream. Time-division switches are commonly also used as tandem switches where time slots from an input TDM trunk are selectively connected to time slots in an output TDM trunk.
