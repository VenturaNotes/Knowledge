- $n$. the controlled addition of fluoride to the public drinking water supply in order to reduce dental caries. Drinking water with a fluoride ion content of one part per million is effective in reducing caries throughout life when given during the years of tooth development. See also FLUOROSIS.
## Source[^2]
- The process of adding very small amounts of fluorine salts (e.g. sodium fluoride, NaF) to drinking water to prevent tooth decay. The fluoride becomes incorporated into the fluoroapatite (see APATITE) of the growing teeth and reduces the incidence of dental caries. However, some argue that there is an accompanying risk of fluoride toxicity.
