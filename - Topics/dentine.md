- The bony material that forms the bulk of a tooth. Dentine is similar in composition to bone but is perforated with many tiny canals for nerve fibres, blood capillaries, and processes of the dentine-forming cells (odontoblasts). Ivory, the material that forms elephant tusks, is made of dentine.

- $n$. the hard tissue that forms the main structure of a tooth. It is the second hardest tissue in the body after enamel and is about $70 \%$ mineral (hydroxyapatite crystals), the remainder being organic matter and water. The dentine of the crown is covered by enamel and that of the root by cementum. The dentine is permeated by fine tubules, which near the centre of the tooth contain cellular processes from the pulp. Exposed dentine is sensitive to touch, heat, and cold.
