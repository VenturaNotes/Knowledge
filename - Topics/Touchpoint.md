- A touchpoint (or point of contact) is an interaction between a customer and a business. Touchpoints can happen at any point. The interaction might be a:
	- Phone call
	- Social media message
	- Online advertisement
	- Television advertisement
	- Email
	- Blog post
	- Trade show
	- Face-to-face conversation with a sales agent
- Touchpoints almost always involve the exchange of information between a customer and a business. For example, a touchpoint occurs when a customer contacts an organization about a product demo or free trial. Many organizations create touchpoint strategies that move customers through their sales and marketing pipelines. These strategies might include contacting customers after they complete a specific action such as purchasing a product online.
