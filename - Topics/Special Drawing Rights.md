- (SDRs) The standard unit of account used by the International Monetary Fund (IMF). In 1970 members of the IMF were allocated SDRs in proportion to the quotas of currency that they had subscribed to the fund on its formation. There have since been further allocations. SDRs can be used to settle international trade balances and to repay debts to the IMF itself. On the instructions of the IMF a member country must supply its own currency to another member, in exchange for SDRs, unless it already holds more than three times its original allocation. The value of SDRs was originally expressed in terms of gold, but since 1974 it has been valued in terms of its members' currencies. SDRs provide a credit facility for IMF members in addition to their existing credit facilities (hence the name); unlike these existing facilities they do not have to be repaid, thus forming a permanent addition to members' reserves and functioning as an international reserve currency.

- (SDRs) A form of international money, created by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and defined as a weighted average of various convertible currencies. The IMF's official accounts are kept in terms of SDRs as units of account. Members have holdings of SDRs which can be used to settle balance-of-payments deficits between them, subject to rules governing the average amount to be held over any five-year period.
