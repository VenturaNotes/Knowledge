## Source [^1]
- An analytical method of job evaluation in which jobs are scored on a number of different features (e.g. skills, effort, level of responsibility, working conditions, etc.). The scores are then summed and used to create a graded pay structure. The method, which is very widely used, is essentially a refinement of the factor-comparison method. See also Classification method; Hay method; Job-Component method; RANKING METHOD.
