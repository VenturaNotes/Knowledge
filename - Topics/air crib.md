- $n$. A closed, electrically heated, sound-insulated compartment, about the size of an ordinary crib, in which a baby can be kept without clothing or blankets, one wall containing a panel of safety glass that can be opened like a window and across which a curtain can be drawn to darken the compartment, the floor consisting of tightly stretched moveable canvas operated like a roller towel, stored on a spool outside the compartment on one side and passing into a wire hamper on the other. Toys, including musical boxes, can be placed in the compartment, within which the baby is protected from airborne infections, dust, and allergens, and an advantage claimed for the air crib is that, because the baby's crying is almost inaudible from the outside and there are no hazards within it, reinforcement (1) of crying is unlikely to occur. The device was invented by the US psychologist B(urrhus) F(rederic) Skinner (1904-90), who raised his second daughter Deborah in it and described the results in an article in the Ladies Home Journal in October 1945. The device attracted a great deal of controversy, but a study of 50 former air-crib babies and their parents, published in 1995, reported wholly positive results. Also called a Skinner crib.
