- $n$. The ratio of total present benefits $(B)$ to total present costs $(C)$, sometimes used in cost-benefit analysis with the assumption that a project is worthwhile if and only if $B / C$ is greater than 1 , but this ratio leads to ambiguities. Consider a proposed wind farm that is judged to produce benefits worth 5m (in any currency), to result in environmental damage worth 2m , and to cost 1m to build. If the environmental damage is classified as a negative benefit, then $B=5 \mathrm{~m}-2 \mathrm{~m}=3 \mathrm{~m},~ C=1 \mathrm{~m}$, and the benefit-cost ratio $B / C=3 / 1=3$, suggesting that the project is very worthwhile. But if the environmental damage is classified as a positive cost, then $B=5 \mathrm{~m}, C=2 \mathrm{~m}+1 \mathrm{~m}=3 \mathrm{~m}$, and the benefit-cost ratio $B / C=5 / 3=$ 1.67, and the project is much less worthwhile. The net benefit index $B-C=$ $5 \mathrm{m}~\textendash~3 \mathrm{m}=2 \mathrm{m}$ without any ambiguity. Also written benefit/cost ratio or benefit : cost ratio.
