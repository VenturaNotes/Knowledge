- the framework through which the NHS aims to deliver high-quality services within a safe system, with continuous efforts for service improvement. Introduced in 1998, clinical governance emphasizes the concept of accountability: organizations, teams, and individuals should understand and accept their roles and responsibilities in delivering care. The range of activities undertaken under the banner of clinical governance includes ensuring clinical effectiveness of treatments, risk management, clinical audit, quality assurance, patient and public involvement (in local Healthwatch groups), staff education, development, and training (see APPRAISAL; REVALIDATION), and research. There is a push in the NHS towards integrated governance: a cohesive approach to all governance arrangements (clinical, corporate, and financial) in organizations, with an emphasis on involving patients and external stakeholders in the development of future arrangements. See also Care Quality COMMISSION; INTEGRATED CARE PATHWAY; NICE; NATIONAL SERVICE FRAMEWORKS.
