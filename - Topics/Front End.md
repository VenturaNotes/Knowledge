- In a business context, the term front end is used to describe the part of a company that outside entities interact with. Typically, the sales, marketing, and public relations (PR) departments of a corporation are considered the front end of a company.
- In the software development industry, the term front end refers to the user interface that a software or website user interacts with. Front-end developers often place great importance on the appearance and functionality of the front end of their applications or websites, since it has the power to either attract or drive away potential customers. For instance, it is more likely that an eCommerce website with an attractive, user-friendly design will sell more products and attract more customers than an eCommerce website that is difficult to use and unpleasant to the eye. Businesses that recognize that customers value ease of use and clear messaging often have strategically configured websites that are both easy and enjoyable to use.
