## Source[^2]
- (womb) $n$. the part of the female reproductive tract that is specialized to allow the embryo to become implanted in its inner wall and to nourish the growing fetus from the maternal blood. The nonpregnant uterus is a pear-shaped organ, about 7.5 cm long. It is suspended in the pelvic cavity by means of peritoneal folds (ligaments) and fibrous bands. The upper two-thirds of the uterus (body) is connected to the two Fallopian tubes, and the narrower lower third (cervix, or neck) projects at its lower end into the vagina. The uterus has an inner mucous lining (endometrium) and a thick wall of smooth muscle (myometrium). During childbirth the myometrium undergoes strong contractions to expel the fetus through the cervix and vagina. In the absence of pregnancy the endometrium undergoes periodic development and degeneration (see MENSTRUAL CYCLE). â€”uterine adj.
## Source[^3]
- (womb) (pl. uteri) The organ of female mammals in which the embryo develops. Paired in most mammals but single in humans, it is situated between the bladder and rectum and is connected to the fallopian tubes and to the vagina. The lining (see ENDOMETRIUM) shows cyclical changes (see MENSTRUAL CYCLE; OESTROUS CYCLE) associated with egg production (see OVARIAN CYCLE) and provides a thick spongy layer in which the fertilized egg becomes embedded. The outer wall of the uterus (myometrium) is thick and muscular; by contracting, it forces the fully grown fetus through the vagina to the outside.
