- (womb) $n$. the part of the female reproductive tract that is specialized to allow the embryo to become implanted in its inner wall and to nourish the growing fetus from the maternal blood. The nonpregnant uterus is a pear-shaped organ, about 7.5 cm long. It is suspended in the pelvic cavity by means of peritoneal folds (ligaments) and fibrous bands. The upper two-thirds of the uterus (body) is connected to the two Fallopian tubes, and the narrower lower third (cervix, or neck) projects at its lower end into the vagina. The uterus has an inner mucous lining (endometrium) and a thick wall of smooth muscle (myometrium). During childbirth the myometrium undergoes strong contractions to expel the fetus through the cervix and vagina. In the absence of pregnancy the endometrium undergoes periodic development and degeneration (see MENSTRUAL CYCLE). â€”uterine adj.
