- $n$. a simple sugar found in honey and in such fruit as figs. Fructose is one of the two sugars in sucrose. Fructose from the diet can be used to produce energy by the process known as glycolysis, which takes place in the liver. Fructose is important in the diet of diabetics since, unlike glucose, fructose metabolism is not dependent on insulin.

- (fruit sugar; laevulose) A simple sugar, $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{12} \mathrm{O}_{6}$, stereoisomeric with glucose (see MONOSACCHARIDE). (Although natural fructose is the D-form, it is in fact laevorotatory.) Fructose occurs in green plants, fruits, and honey and tastes sweeter than sucrose (cane sugar), of which it is a constituent. Derivatives of fructose are important in the energy metabolism of living organisms. Some polysaccharide derivatives (fructans) are carbohydrate energy stores in certain plants. Fructose derived from corn starch is now used extensively in food manufacturing as a sucrose substitute, for example in soft drinks, canned fruit, and jams.
