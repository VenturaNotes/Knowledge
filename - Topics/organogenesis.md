- The formation of organs during embryonic development. In animals this begins following the rearrangement of the cells at gastrulation, when the three germ layers are fully formed in their correct positions. Dividing cells of the gastrula begin to differentiate and the rudimentary organs and organ systems begin to form. See DIFFERENTIATION; ECTODERM; ENDODERM; MESODERM.
