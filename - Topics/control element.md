- A segment of noncoding DNA that regulates the expression of a gene in eukaryotic organisms. Control elements bind transcription factors, either activators or repressors, to increase or decrease the rate of expression respectively. Proximal control elements are located close to the promotor site of the gene and are sometimes considered part of the promoter. Other control elements, called enhancers, may be located many nucleotides distant upstream from the promoter. These interact with the promoter by bending of the DNA molecule.
