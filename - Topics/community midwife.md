- (domiciliary midwife) (in Britain) a registered nurse with special training in midwifery (both hospital and domiciliary practice). The midwife must be registered with the Nursing and Midwifery Council in order to practise; this requires regular refresher courses to supplement the basic qualification of Registered Midwife (RM). Community midwives are attached to general practices or hospitals, and their work includes home deliveries and antenatal and postnatal care in the community.
