- Demand pattern analysis (DPA) is a component commonly used in supply chain management. It involves an in-depth, data-driven analysis of customer consumption data to better predict and fulfill future demand. It can be used, for instance, to determine electricity consumption in power companies to determine if the amount of power available to customers should be increased.
