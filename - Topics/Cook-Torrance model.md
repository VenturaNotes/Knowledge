- An extension of the basic reflectance model to make objects look less like plastic. (Plastic has an uncolored substrate, thus reflected light is not significantly altered in color.) A variable is added to alter the intensity of the reflected light dependent on the solid angle of the incident beam. The specular component shifts the wavelength of reflected light depending on the angle of incidence.
