- A sample of a population, chosen by some method which ensures that every member of the population has an equal chance of being picked. See also QUOTA SAMPLE; STRATIFIED SAMPLE.
## Source[^2]
- a subgroup of a total population selected by a random process ensuring that each member of the population has an equal chance of being included in the sample. It is sometimes stratified so that separate samples are drawn from each of several layers of the population, usually on the basis of age, sex, and socio-economic group. Selection is sometimes facilitated by identifying, in advance, certain units (e.g. towns or neighbourhoods) that will together represent the whole (a so-called sampling frame).
