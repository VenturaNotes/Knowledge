## Source [^1]
- KSAOs are assessment tools developed to match job or promotion requirements. KSAO stands for knowledge, skills, ability, and other characteristics. Knowledge refers to information required to perform a job. A skill involves using, handling, or affecting something or someone. Ability is similar to skills, but it's a capacity to do something, which may be part of a skill set if the person can demonstrate it reliably. Other characteristics are attributes that don't fit the other groups.
