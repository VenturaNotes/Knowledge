- $n$. hybrid vigour: the increased sturdiness, resistance to disease, etc., of animals whose parents are genetically different compared both with their parents and with the offspring of genetically similar parents.

- $n$. The increased size, robustness, or health often found in a hybrid $(1,2)$ compared with a pure genetic form, also called hybrid vigour. A well-known example is associated with the gene that causes the disease sickle-cell anaemia, which is endemic in parts of Africa: individuals who are homozygous for this gene develop the disease and tend to die young, whereas heterozygous individuals do not normally develop the disease and are significantly more resistant to malaria than other members of the population. Heterosis is a factor that can contribute towards balanced polymorphism. \[From Greek heteros other + -osis indicating a process or state]
