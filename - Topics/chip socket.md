- A device that allows easy replacement of chips (integrated circuits) on a printed circuit board. The chip socket is soldered to the circuit board; the chip is pushed into the socket, which has a small hole for each of the chip's legs. With larger chips care is needed to avoid bending the legs of the chip on insertion.
