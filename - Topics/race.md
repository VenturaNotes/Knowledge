- (1) (in biology) A category used in the classification of organisms that consists of a group of individuals within a species that are geographically, ecologically, physiologically, or chromosomally distinct from other members of the species. The term is frequently used in the same sense as subspecies. Physiological races, for example, are identical in appearance but differ in function. They include strains of fungi adapted to infect different varieties of the same crop species. 
- (2) (in anthropology) A distinct human type possessing several characteristics that are genetically inherited. Traditionally, anthropologists used the concept of biological races such as Mongolian, Caucasian, and Ethiopian. However, this is now deprecated by many, who regard 'race' as reflecting primarily cultural and social characteristics rather than being rooted in genetic differences. Supporting this view is the finding that genetic variation within so-called 'racial' groups far outweighs the variation between groups.
