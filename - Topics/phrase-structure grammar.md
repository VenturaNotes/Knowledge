- A grammar that contains rules which are capable of both generating strings of linguistic elements and providing a constituent analysis of the strings. In their original form, phrase-structure grammars took the form of a set of rewrite rules, for example$$\mathrm{S} \rightarrow \mathrm{NP}+\mathrm{VP}$$(which reads rewrite S as NP (noun phrase) + VP (verb phrase). Various distinctions have been made between different classes of phrase-structure grammar, primarily between context-sensitive and context-free grammars.
