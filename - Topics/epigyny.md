- A floral arrangement in which the ovary is completely enclosed by the receptacle so that the stamens and perianth arise above it, from the top of the receptacle; i.e. the ovary is inferior (see illustration). The perianth and stamens are said to be epigynous with respect to the ovary, as seen in the daffodil. Compare HYPOGYNY; PERIGYNY.
