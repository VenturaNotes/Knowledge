- (1) All activities concerned with bringing a program to the state where it produces some results (as distinct from, say, failing to compile or terminating abnormally) so that testing can begin. Such activities might include desk checking, i.e. checking by human inspection, and use of a special 'checkout' mode of compilation and execution that provides extensive information on erroneous use of the programming language or abnormal program termination. 
- (2) The action of taking a configuration item from a repository prior to making changes to it. The act of removal usually locks the item so that nobody else may check it out until it has been formally returned.
