- A set of signals that comprises the connection between devices of a computer system where the transfer of information between devices is organized by the exchange of signals not synchronized to some controlling clock. A request signal from an initiating device indicates the requirement to make a transfer; an acknowledging signal from the responding device indicates the transfer completion. This asynchronous interchange is also widely known as handshaking.
