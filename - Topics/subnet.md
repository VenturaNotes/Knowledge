- As the name implies, a subnet is a part of a computer or data network. A subnet is still physically located in a different portion to the main network.Â  This means that is not joined to the main network and resides elsewhere. The subnet does have certain commonalities with the main network. For example, it will share the same address. However, it will also have a subnetwork number that will note the differentiation.
