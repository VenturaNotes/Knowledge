## Synthesis
- Describes the overuse of shared resources when individuals act in their self-interest.
## Source[^1]
- The fact that a common access resource will be over-utilized when users do not take into account the social impact of their actions. Consider a lake that can be used for fishing. The catch of each fisherman will be set to maximize profit by equating private marginal cost (equipment, time, etc.) to private marginal benefit (revenue from the sale of fish). This calculation does not take into account that the catch reduces the quantity of fish available for other fishermen which reduces their revenues. Consequently private marginal benefit is larger than social marginal benefit and the profit-maximizing catch is in excess of what is socially efficient. This over-utilization occurs whenever there is a negative externality between users of the resource and no control over access.
