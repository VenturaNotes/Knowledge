## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- (1) A pattern that specifies a structure-i.e. a relationship between parts of a compound data object-from which instances may be made. The term is a convenient means of differentiating the structure specification from the declaration of individual instances of the structure. 
- (2) See POLYMORPHISM.
## Source[^2]
- Any molecule that acts as a pattern for the synthesis of a new molecule. For example, the two nucleotide chains of a DNA molecule can separate and each acts as a template for the synthesis of the complementary chain (see DNA REPLICATION).
