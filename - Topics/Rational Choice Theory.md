- The [[utility function]] is widely used in this theory to analyze human behavior
## Source[^3]
- A class of theory which posits that individual actors within a given set of constraints, such as a market, make rational decisions between possible courses of action with the aim of maximizing the utility of the outcome. Most conventional economics is based on this assumption and the rational choice model has also been influential in sociology and political science. More recently, critics of rational choice theory have sought to analyze why actors do not always make the decisions the theory would predict; some notable work of this kind has been done in the field of behavioral finance. See also PROSPECT THEORY; UTILITY THEORY.
