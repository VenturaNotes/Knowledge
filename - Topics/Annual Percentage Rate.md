- (APR) The annual equivalent rate of return on a loan or investment in which the rate of interest specified is chargeable or payable more frequently than annually. Most investment institutions are now required by law to specify the APR when the interest intervals are more frequent than annual. Similarly those charge cards that advertise monthly rates of interest (say, $2 \%$ ) must state the equivalent APR; in this case it would be $\left[(1.02)^{12}-1\right]=26.8 \%$.
