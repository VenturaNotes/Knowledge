- Digital business transformation is a strategy that a business develops to remain competitive in a digital economy. While specific strategies will vary from one company to the next, most practices involve automating certain tasks with machine learning or artificial intelligence (AI) or delving deeper into the customer experience. Some examples of digital business transformation strategies include transferring paper files to digital ones, adding self-service portals, using customer service chatbots, or engaging with customers through social media platforms.
