- A byte is a sequence of [[bit|binary digits]] made up of 8 bits
## Source[^2]
- Eight bits of binary data.
## Source[^3]
- A fixed number of bits that can be treated as a unit by the computer hardware. It is a subdivision of a word, and almost always comprises 8 bits although 6, 7, or 9 bits are occasionally encountered.
- The letters B and b are commonly used as symbols for byte, as in MB ([[megabyte]]), and GB (gigabyte), although the word is often written in full in such cases, as in Mbyte.
- See also CHARACTER.

## Source[^4]
- A block of bits, usually 8, used in computing as the code for a single character (as in ASCII)
