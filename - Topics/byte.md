## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A byte is a sequence of [[bit|binary digits]] made up of 8 bits
## Source[^2]
- Eight bits of binary data.
## Source[^3]
- A fixed number of bits that can be treated as a unit by the computer hardware. It is a subdivision of a word, and almost always comprises 8 bits although 6, 7, or 9 bits are occasionally encountered.
- The letters B and b are commonly used as symbols for byte, as in MB ([[megabyte]]), and GB (gigabyte), although the word is often written in full in such cases, as in Mbyte.
- See also CHARACTER.

## Source[^4]
- A block of bits, usually 8, used in computing as the code for a single character (as in ASCII)
## Source[^5]
- A unit of information in a computer, consisting of a group of binary digits, that represents a number or character. Most computers use a byte with 8 binary digits. Byte and character are often used synonymously. For example, a USB flash drive holding 1 gigabyte will in theory store 1,000,000,000 characters.
## Source[^6]
- $n$. A measure of information (2) equivalent to (usually) eight bits, sufficient to encode a character from a basic set of letters, numbers, and other symbols. Compare nYbble. \[Named in 1956 by the German computer engineer Werner Buchholz (born 1922) while working for IBM. An arbitrary formation, based on bit and bite, possibly influenced by b(inar)y (digi)t e(ight)]
