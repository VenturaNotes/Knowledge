- An algebra generated by elements named as constants in its signature. Every element of the algebra can be constructed by finitely many applications of the basic operations to the constants. The simplest example is the algebra$$(\{0,1,2, \ldots\} |0, n+1)$$wherein all natural numbers can be constructed by applying the successor function $n+1$ to the constant 0 sufficiently many times.
