- n. In psychoanalysis, a characteristic of dreams, symptoms, and other psychological phenomena of manifesting their causative factor more than once or providing more than one outlet for a wish or need. In his book The Interpretation of Dreams (1900), Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) described it as follows: 'Each of the elements of the dream's content turns out to have been "over-determined"$\textemdash$to have been represented in the dream-thoughts many times over' (Standard Edition, IV$\textendash$V, at p. 283). Overdetermination is a consequence of condensation. Also called multiple determination. See also OVERINTERPRETATION, PSYCHICAL DETERMINISM. overdetermined adj.
