## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A special program that processes statements written in a particular programming language and turns them into machine language or “code” that a computer's processor uses.
## Source[^2]
- A program that translates high-level language into absolute code, intermediate code, or sometimes assembly language. The input to the compiler (the source code) is a description of an algorithm or program in a problem-oriented language; its output (the object code) is an equivalent description of the algorithm in a machine-oriented language. See also JIT COMPILER.
## Source[^3]
- A compiler is a computer program that translates computer code written in one programming language (source code) into another, more basic programming language. Typically, the source code is a high-level programming language—such as JavaScript—that gets translated into a lower-level machine language (such as binary or bytecode, for example) that is better understood by a system's processor. The output of a compiler is called an object code, which is a machine language that a computer processor can easily understand and execute one instruction at a time. It's important to note that compilers do not fix computer code; this means that if the code is faulty then the compiler will not be able to translate one programming language into another more basic machine language.
