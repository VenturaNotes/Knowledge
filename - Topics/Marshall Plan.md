- A large programme of US aid to assist recovery of the European economies from the effects of the Second World War. The plan was proposed by the US Secretary of State, George C. Marshall (18801959). From 1948 to 1951 the US provided assistance in grants and loans to various European countries, including Austria, France, West Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, and the UK. The main role of this aid in promoting recovery is thought to have been the provision of reserves to restore confidence in financial stability, and the provision of working capital to allow liberalization of production and prices.
