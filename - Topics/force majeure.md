- (French: superior force) An event outside the control of either party to a contract (such as a strike, riot, war, act of God) that may excuse either party from fulfilling his contractual obligations in certain circumstances, provided that the contract contains a force majeure clause. If one party invokes the force majeure clause the other may either accept that it is applicable or challenge the interpretation. In the latter case an arbitration would be involved.
