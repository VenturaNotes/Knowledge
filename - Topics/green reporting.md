- (environmental accounting) A report by the directors of a company that attempts to quantify the costs and benefits of that company's operations in relation to the environment. At present relatively few companies disclose such information in their annual accounts and report. This is, however, a growing practice and reflects the concerns of many investors, consumers, and other stakeholders. New Zealand is one of several countries that have recently introduced legislation on green reporting. The European Union's Accounts Modernization Directive, which is binding on publicly listed companies from 1 January 2005, states that company information should disclose the environmental impact of a business's activities 'where appropriate'. See also ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIT; ENVIRONMENTAL COSTS; SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REPORTING; TRIPLE BOTTOM-LINE ACCOUNTING.
