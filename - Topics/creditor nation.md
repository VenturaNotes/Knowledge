- A country with positive net foreign assets. Foreign assets include outward foreign direct investment and loans to foreigners. Against this must be offset any external liabilities: inward foreign direct investment, foreign deposits in domestic banks, and ownership of domestic securities. A country is a creditor nation if its external assets exceed its external liabilities.
