- $n$. a physiologically inactive form of the hormone prolactin, bound to immunoglobulin G to create a much bigger molecule. It is found in a small proportion of people but is important because some laboratory assays will detect it as prolactin, leading to a falsely elevated prolactin level in the blood and a misdiagnosis of hyperprolactinaemia (see PROLACTIN).
