- A type of inhibitory interneuron found in various parts of the central nervous system, including the cortex of the cerebellum and cerebral cortex. They are characterized by widely branching dendrites that form a netlike arrangement around the cell body of a connecting neuron. In the cerebellum the basket cells synapse with the cell bodies of the Purkyne cells.

- $n$. Any of a class of inhibitory interneurons found in the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum, having a short axon that divides into a large number of processes and forms basket-like networks round the cell bodies of numerous Purkinje cells, whose action it inhibits. Compare Golgi Cell, Stellate Cell.
