- The transparent red variety of the mineral corundum, the colour being due to the presence of traces of chromium. It is a valuable gemstone, more precious than diamonds. The finest rubies are obtained from Mogok in Burma, where they occur in metamorphic limestones; Sri Lanka and Thailand are the only other important sources. Rubies have been produced synthetically by the Verneuil flame-fusion process. Industrial rubies are used in lasers, watches, and other precision instruments.
