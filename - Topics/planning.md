## Source [^1]
- Given a description of a set of actions and a desired goal state, a plan is a specified sequence of the actions that will allow an agent to move from a starting state to achieve the goal state. Planning is a major branch of artificial intelligence and planners are often implemented as a heuristic search process, the synthesis of a plan being seen as finding a path from start to goal through a search space.
