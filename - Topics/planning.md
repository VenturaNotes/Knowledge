## Source [^1]
- Given a description of a set of actions and a desired goal state, a plan is a specified sequence of the actions that will allow an agent to move from a starting state to achieve the goal state. Planning is a major branch of artificial intelligence and planners are often implemented as a heuristic search process, the synthesis of a plan being seen as finding a path from start to goal through a search space.

- (land-use) Controls by central or local government over the use of land. These are common, because of the importance of externalities resulting from land use. Land-use planning is intended to keep activities causing negative externalities, such as noise or visual intrusion, away from places where they are believed to be particularly harmful. Land-use controls typically operate more strictly on changes of use and new activities than on continuation of existing activities.
