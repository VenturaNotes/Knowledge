- n. A theory advanced in 1951 by the English psychiatrist (Edward) John (Mostyn) Bowlby (1907-90) according to which an infant has an inborn biological need for close contact with its mother (or other main carer), a normal bond developing within the first 6 months of life through the mother's responsiveness to these needs, and maternal deprivation during this critical period having adverse effects on psychological development.
