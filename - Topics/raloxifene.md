- $n$. a drug used to prevent and treat osteoporosis that develops after the menopause. Raloxifene is a selective (o)estrogen receptor modulator (SERM): it mimics the protective action of oestrogen in the bones without the risk of the adverse effects (e.g. on the breast and uterus) associated with hormone replacement therapy. However, it does not relieve menopausal symptoms. Side-effects include hot flushes, and there is a risk of thromboembolism and thrombophlebitis.
