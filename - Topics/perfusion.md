- $n$. 
- (1) the passage of fluid through a tissue, especially the passage of blood through the lung tissue to pick up oxygen from the air in the alveoli, which is brought there by ventilation, and release carbon dioxide. If ventilation is impaired deoxygenated venous blood is returned to the general circulation. If perfusion is impaired insufficient gas exchange takes place. 
- (2) the deliberate introduction of fluid into a tissue, usually by injection into the blood vessels supplying the tissue.
