- an unusual phenomenon in newborn babies characterized by transient red color changes to half of the body, well demarcated at the midline. It is seen usually $2-5$ days after birth and can last from 30 seconds to 20 minutes before fading away. It may recur when the infant is placed on his or her side as the intensity of the erythema appears to be gravity-dependent.
