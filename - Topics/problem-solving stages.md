- $n$. The successive phases that can be observed in the process of problem solving. According to the most influential scheme, proposed by the English psychologist Graham Wallas (1858-1932) in his book The Art of Thought (1921), the stages are preparation, incubation, illumination or insight (2), and verification. According to the US philosopher John Dewey (1859-1952) in his book How We Think (1933), the stages are suggestion, translation of a difficulty into a well-defined problem, framing of a hypothesis, reasoning, and testing.
