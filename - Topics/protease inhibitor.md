- any one of a class of drugs used in the treatment of HIV infection and AIDS. Used in combination with other antiretroviral drugs, they act by inhibiting the action of protease, an enzyme produced by HIV that cleaves two precursor proteins into smaller fragments. These fragments are required for viral growth, infectivity, and replication. Protease inhibitors include atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir and ritonavir (which are used in combination), saquinavir, and tipranavir. Side-effects include nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, and rashes; these drugs are also associated with hyperglycaemia and lipodystrophy. See also BOCEPREVIR.
