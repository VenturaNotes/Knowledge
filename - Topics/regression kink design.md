- A method of estimation designed to find the causal effect when a policy variable has discontinuities in the first derivative, or 'kinks'. The response to the policy, measured by the dependent variable, is also likely to have kinks. A typical example is the estimation of the effect of unemployment benefits on unemployment duration when the benefits are determined by a formula based on previous earnings which has kinks caused by different rates for different brackets of earnings.
