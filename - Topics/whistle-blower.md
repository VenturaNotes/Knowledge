- An employee who reveals evidence of wrongdoing or malpractice within a business or other organization. In the UK the practice is now officially termed 'making a disclosure in the public interest'. The disclosure may be made to an authorized person within the company, to an authorized body outside the company, or in some cases to the media. Employees in many jurisdictions have legal protection against dismissal resulting from whistle-blowing where the company's behaviour endangers others, damages the environment, or breaks the law.
