- Control acting between two applications that are communicating across one or more networks. Data traversing a network must be protected against a number of possible forms of error. An individual unit of data may be corrupted, lost completely, or delivered more than once; successive units of data may be delivered in the wrong order. The sender may attempt to transmit data more quickly than the receiver can receive it, or some part of the route can actually carry it. Within the network, the transmitter and receiver at the two ends of an individual link will cooperate to control some of these errors, and this is known as [[point-to-point control]]. However, it may also be necessary to require the applications at each end of the overall connection to cooperate in protecting against other forms of error, and this is end-to-end control.
