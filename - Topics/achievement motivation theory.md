- A theory that establishes a relationship between personal characteristics, social background, and achievement. A person with a strong need for achievement tends to exhibit such characteristics as:
	- regarding the task as more important than any relationship;
	- having a preference for tasks over which they have control and responsibility;
	- needing to identify closely, and be identified closely, with the successful outcomes of their actions;
	- seeking tasks that are sufficiently difficult to be challenging, to be capable of demonstrating expertise, and to gain recognition from others, while also being sufficiently easy to be capable of achievement;
	- avoiding the likelihood and consequences of failure;
	- requiring feedback on achievements to ensure that success is recognized;
	- needing opportunities for promotion.
- The need for achievement is based on a combination of intrinsic motivation (drives from within the individual) and extrinsic motivation (pressures and expectations exerted by an organization, peers, and society). Achievement is also clearly influenced by education, social awareness, cultural background, and values. See MOTIVATION.
