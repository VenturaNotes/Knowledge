- The function $r: L \to L,$ where $L$ denotes strings of characters from some alphabet, defined in such a way that $r$ reverses the order of the elements in its parameter. If & denotes concatenation of strings, then $$r(s) = s$$if s is null or a single character and $$r(s\space \& \space t) = r(t)\space \& \space r(s)$$The idea can be extended to include reversing of items in a list, of items in some sequence, or of items in an arbitrary one-dimensional array. Reversal is an involution operation.
