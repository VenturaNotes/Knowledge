- When an instantaneously decodable code is to be formed from an alphabet of $q$ letters, with the $i$th codeword being $\lambda_{i}$ letters in length, Kraft's inequality$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} q^{-\lambda_{i}} \leqslant 1$$is a necessary and sufficient condition for such a code to be constructible with $n$ codewords. In a code with no codewords remaining for allocation, the equality sign operates. See also PREFIX CODES.
