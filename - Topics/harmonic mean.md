- The harmonic mean $H$ of $n$ numbers $\left(x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}\right)$ is defined by$$\frac{1}{H}=\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{1}{x_{i}}$$The value of the harmonic mean is always less than the arithmetic mean and the geometric mean, and is less affected by large outliers.

- $n$. In descriptive statistics, the average value of a set of scores calculated by taking the reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of the reciprocals of the scores. The scores $3,4,5$ have reciprocal $\frac 13, \frac 14, \frac 15$, and the arithmetic mean of these reciprocals is 0.261 , so the harmonic mean of the set of scores is $1 / 0.261=3.831$. Compare arithmetic mean, GEOMETRIC MEAN.
