- An average taken over a specified period of the variable cost of producing units of production (see average COST). The variable costs (such as the cost of raw materials, direct labor, machine time, etc.) of producing a unit are those that vary directly with the number of units produced. As they are likely to change from time to time it may be convenient for budgeting purposes to take an average.
