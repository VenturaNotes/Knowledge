- A tax collected by stamping the legal documents giving effect to certain transactions: the rate of duty is $1 / 2 \%$ of the consideration given, the charge being rounded up to the nearest $Â£ 5$. Since 1 December 2003 stamp duty proper has been charged solely on traditional stampable documents relating to shares and securities (including bearer instruments). A transfer of shares and securities that is made without a stampable document (i.e. electronically) is charged to stamp duty reserve tax. A transfer of land is now charged to stamp duty land tax.
