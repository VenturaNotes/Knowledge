- A young employee who signs a contract (an indenture or articles of apprenticeship) agreeing to be trained in a particular skill for a set amount of time by a specific employer. During this time the wages will be relatively low but on completion of the apprenticeship they increase to reflect the increased status of the employee and to recognize the skills acquired.
