## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
- ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character
	- such as 'a' or @
## Source[^2]
- ASCII is a universally accepted [[Character Encoding|character encoding]] standard
## Source[^3]
- A binary code representing characters used by monitors, printers, etc.
## Source[^4]
- American Standard Code for Information Interchange. An encoding format that allocates a numeric code to characters (e.g. digits, letters, punctuation marks, etc.) in order for them to be represented in binary within a computer system.
## Source[^5]
- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet.
## Source[^6]
- A standard character encoding scheme introduced in 1963 and used widely on many machines. It is a 7 -bit code with no parity recommendation, providing 128 different bit patterns. This encoding now forms the 'Basic Latin' block of the Unicode encoding scheme.
- See also ISO-7, CHARACTER SET.
## Source[^7]
- This code is another way of referring to computer characters. There are many different formats for how keyboards and monitors display data. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) includes letters, numbers, spaces, and a new page option. Virtually every modern computer uses some form of ASCII. Some computers may use additional characters that add-on to the basic ASCII. One of the defining characteristics of ASCII is that it uses 7 bits to display data. ASCII can define up to 128 characters.
