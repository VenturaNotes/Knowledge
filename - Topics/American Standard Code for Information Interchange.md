## Synthesis
- 
## Source[^1]
- ASCII code is the numerical representation of a character
	- such as 'a' or @
## Source[^2]
- ASCII is a universally accepted [[Character Encoding|character encoding]] standard
## Source[^3]
- A binary code representing characters used by monitors, printers, etc.
## Source[^4]
- American Standard Code for Information Interchange. An encoding format that allocates a numeric code to characters (e.g. digits, letters, punctuation marks, etc.) in order for them to be represented in binary within a computer system.
## Source[^5]
- ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is the most common character encoding format for text data in computers and on the internet.
## Source[^6]
- A standard character encoding scheme introduced in 1963 and used widely on many machines. It is a 7 -bit code with no parity recommendation, providing 128 different bit patterns. This encoding now forms the 'Basic Latin' block of the Unicode encoding scheme.
- See also ISO-7, CHARACTER SET.
## Source[^7]
- This code is another way of referring to computer characters. There are many different formats for how keyboards and monitors display data. American Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII) includes letters, numbers, spaces, and a new page option. Virtually every modern computer uses some form of ASCII. Some computers may use additional characters that add-on to the basic ASCII. One of the defining characteristics of ASCII is that it uses 7 bits to display data. ASCII can define up to 128 characters.

## Source[^8]
- Acronym for American Standard Code for Information Interchange, a standard code adopted by many computer manufacturers to simplify the transfer of information between computers. The code represents the numbers, letters, and symbols used in computing by a standard set of numbers. It is based on coding with 7 bits and provides $2^{7}$ (i.e. 128) distinct numbered characters. Other characters with values from 129 to 256 (based on 8 bits) form an extended character set (known as extended ASCII). In recent years ASCII has been largely superseded by Unicode.
