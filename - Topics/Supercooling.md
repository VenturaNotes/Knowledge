## Synthesis
- Water can remain in a liquid state below $0\degree C$ in a process called supercooling. 
	- The water must be free of [[impurity|impurities]]
- Supercooled water is often seen in controlled lab conditions or occasionally in nature, such as in clouds, where liquid droplets can exist at temperatures well below freezing.
## Source [^1]
- The cooling of a liquid below its normal freezing point without changing from a liquid to a solid. Water is relatively amenable to supercooling, and many organisms living in cold environments exploit this property to avoid freezing of their body water and consequent tissue damage. Supercooling of extracellular fluids requires first the exclusion of potential ice-nucleating agents, such as food particles, that could promote the formation of ice crystals. Hence, animals preparing for winter frequently void their gut contents. Second, the animal manufactures antifreeze molecules, such as glycerol, which depress the freezing point. These measures can be extremely effective in achieving supercooling.
