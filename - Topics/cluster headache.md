- a variant of migraine more common in men than in women (ratio 9:1). The unilateral pain around one eye is very severe and lasts between 15 minutes and 3 hours. The attacks commonly occur in the early hours of the morning but may occur up to eight times a day. The pain is associated with drooping of the eyelid (ptosis), a bloodshot eye, a small pupil, and/or excessive production of tears in the eye. The acute treatment is with high-flow inhaled oxygen in conjunction with antimigraine drugs ($5 \mathrm{HT}_{1}$ agonists) and prophylaxis is with such drugs as verapamil, lithium, or methysergide.
