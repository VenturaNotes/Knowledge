- A Service-Level Objective (SLO) is a part of a service-level agreement (SLA) between a customer and service provider. It outlines the level of service the provider must provide to the customer. An SLO is often expressed in a numerical format. For example, an SLO might promise a server uptime of 98 percent. Or, it might say that a team member will respond to an inquiry within 24 hours. A service provider might issue a credit to customers if it fails to meet an SLO. Most SLAs contain clauses about this type of compensation. Alternatively, a customer can terminate an SLA if an SLO isn'tÂ met.
