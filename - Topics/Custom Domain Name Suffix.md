- A custom domain name suffix, also known as a custom top-level domain (TLD) name, refers to the last few characters of an organizationʻs domain name (such as “.com” or “.org”) that a company has customized for branding purposes.
- Corporations that wish to purchase custom TLDs must submit an application to the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN). The custom TLD application fee costs about $185,000, which is only partially refunded if an organizationʻs application is rejected.
- Businesses often purchase a custom TLD that reflects their company name to increase brand visibility and help customers avoid spoofing websites (pages that pose as a valid company website to steal customer information). Examples of a custom TLD include “.Microsoft” or “.Apple”.
