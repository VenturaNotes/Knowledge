## Source [^1]
- The argument that there is a strategic advantage to being the first to act. For example, in a Stackelberg duopoly with homogeneous products the firm that is the first mover in choosing output will earn higher profit compared to the level obtained when moves are made simultaneously, as in Cournot competition. Not all games are characterized by first-mover advantage (consider playing paper-stone-scissors with sequential moves).
