## Source[^2]
- $n$. A central nervous system stimulant drug and sympathomimetic, extracted mainly from the Chinese mahuang plant or manufactured synthetically, that acts indirectly by increasing the release of noradrenalin (norepinephrine) from presynaptic neurons in the central nervous system and is used mainly for treating hay fever and asthma. It manifests tachyphylaxis, a standard dosage producing a rapid and shortlived increase in blood pressure, but the same dosage repeated at 10-minute intervals resulting in smaller and smaller effects until, after several dosages, there is virtually no change in blood pressure. Also spelt ephedrin. Its street names include Cloud nine and herbal ecstasy. Formula: $\mathrm{C}_{6} \mathrm{H}_{5} \mathrm{CHOHCH}\left(\mathrm{CH}_{3}\right)\textemdash\mathrm{NHCH}_{3}$. \[From Latin Ephedra sinica the biological name of the mahuang plant from which it was originally extracted + -ine indicating a chemical compound]
