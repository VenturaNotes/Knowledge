- A disposable email is an email address service that allows registered users to receive emails at a temporary address. Emails sent to disposable email addresses expire after a certain period of time. Disposable email accounts enable users to sign up and verify registration with various companies without exposing their primary email address to spam. Disposable email addresses are also referred to as burner emails, due to their self-destructing nature.
