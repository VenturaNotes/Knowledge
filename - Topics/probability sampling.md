- (random sampling) A sampling procedure in which each element of a population has a known chance of being selected for the sample. Apart from simple random sampling, this includes certain forms of stratified sampling and systematic sampling. The process depends upon reliable, up-to-date lists of the population being available; without such lists a probability sample cannot be chosen. Compare NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING.
