## Synthesis
- A computer's CPU can load data, perform calculations, and jump to another part of a program 
	- #question Is this true? 
	- #question What is meant by jumping to another part of a program?
### Description
- The part of the computer that retrieves and carries out instructions for processes
	- #question What is meant by processes here?
## Source [^1]
- Factors that can significantly impact the performance of a CPU
	- Number of cores
	- Cache Size
	- Clock Speed
- [[Overclocking]] can improve CPU performance
- The CPU performs a continuous process to carry out instructions
	- This is called the Fetch, Decode, Execute cycle
## Source[^2]
- A central processing unit (CPU) or central processor is the part of a computer that retrieves and carries out instructions for processes.
- Think of a CPU as the control center of a computer that processes complicated instructions when users browse the internet, send emails, or watch videos. The CPU ensures a computer system works properly. There are various CPU types such as a single-core CPU, dual-core CPU, quad-core CPU, and octa-core processor. Each performs similarly: The CPU executes calculations, makes comparisons and tells a computer what to do.

- $n$. The part of a computer that executes programs. Also called a central processor. CPU abbrev.
