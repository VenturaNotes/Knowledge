- In computer networking, the term ‘preamble’ is defined as a network communications signal that synchronizes data transmission between two or more computer systems. A preamble is one part of an Ethernet data frame’s contents, defined as the contents of a single data packet transmitted over an Ethernet connection. An Ethernet preamble is delivered to a network receiver in the form of a binary pattern (1s and 0s).
- A preamble updates a data packet’s delivery status to a network receiver.
