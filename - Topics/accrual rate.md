- The fraction used to express the rate of increase of the pension entitlement in a final salary scheme. Sixtieths and eightieths are the most commonly found rates. For example, in a sixtieth scheme the accrual rate is 1/60 of final salary per year. Hence, after 30 years' service a pension of one half (30/60) of final salary will be paid.
