- Given a finite group G = {$g_1, ..., g_n$} and a field F, the group algebra $FG$ consists of the formal linear combinations $$\sum_{k=1}^{n} f_ig_i \qquad \text{where} \space f_1, ...,f_n \in F.$$Such linear combinations then can be added and multiplied naturally, giving FG the structure of an algebra.
