- 1. A method of logical inference in which a general but not necessarily true conclusion is drawn from a set of particular instances. In machine learning, for example, the term induction is used to describe an approach to machine learning in which generalized structures or statements are inferred from particular examples. 2. A process for proving mathematical statements involving members of an ordered set (possibly infinite). There are various formulations of the principle of induction. For example, by the principle of finite induction, to prove a statement $P(i)$ is true for all integers $i \geq i_{0}$, it suffices to prove that

(a) $P\left(i_{0}\right)$ is true;

(b) for all $k \geq i_{0}$, the assumption that $P(k)$ is true (the induction hypothesis) implies the truth of $P(k+1)$.

(a) is called the basis of the proof, (b) is the induction step.

  

Generalizations are possible. Other forms of induction permit the induction step to assume the truth of $P(k)$ and also that of

  

$$

P(k-1), P(k-2), \ldots, P(k-i)

$$

  

for suitable $i$. Statements of several variables can also be considered. See also STRUCTURAL INDUCTION.

- (1) (in obstetrics) the starting of labour by artificial means. It is carried out using such drugs as prostaglandins to prime the cervix and/or amniotomy prior to synthetic oxytocin (Syntocinon), which stimulate uterine contractions. Induction of labour is carried out if the wellbeing or life of mother or child is threatened by continuance of the pregnancy. 
- (2) (in anaesthesia) initiation of anaesthesia. General anaesthesia is usually induced by the intravenous injection of short-acting anaesthetics, e.g. thiopental.

- (1) (in embryology) The ability of natural stimuli (inducers) to cause unspecialized embryonic tissue to develop into specialized tissue. 
- (2) (in genetics) Inactivation of repression of a gene or operon by binding of an inducer (sense 2) to a repressor. Gene products, such as enzymes, that are synthesized following induction are said to be inducible. 
- (3) (in obstetrics) The initiation of childbirth by artificial means; for example, by injection of the hormone oxytocin.

- (1) A form of reasoning, also called empirical induction, in which a general law or principle is inferred from particular instances that have been observed. Many people believe that this form of reasoning works in practice, and it is widely believed to form the basis of all empirical sciences, but the Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711-76) showed in $A$ Treatise of Human Nature in 1739 that induction is logically invalid: from the premise All swans that have been observed are white it is not valid to conclude that Therefore, all swans are white. There is a missing premise, that All swans have been observed, which is not true and could never be true of any universal proposition in science that is supposed to apply throughout time and space. Hume pointed out that the uniformity of nature might justify induction, in the form of the premise Future observations will resemble past observations, but this could be justified only by a question-begging appeal to induction itself, and in any event it is not true in general$\textemdash$for example, there are black swans in Australia. This apparent inconsistency is called the problem of induction or Hume's problem, and it is solved by the insight that empirical evidence is used to falsify rather than to confirm hypotheses. See also falsifiability, Goodman's paradox, HEMPEL's PARADOX, HYPOTHETICO-DEDUCTIVE METHOD. Compare DeduCTION. 
- (2) A mathematical technique, also called mathematical induction, for proving that a statement or proposition (1) is true in general, or (equivalently) that each of an infinite sequence of statements is true, by proving that the first statement in the sequence is true, and then that if any one of the statements is true it follows that the next one is also true. 
- (3) Indirect generation of a sensory experience without direct stimulation of the corresponding sensory receptors, by stimulation of adjacent or related sensory processes. See COLOR INDUCTION, INDUCED MOTION, VISUAL INDUCTION, WARMTH CONTRAST. 
- (4) The name given by the Russian physiologist Ivan Petrovich Pavlov (1849-1936) to positive induction, in which the response to an excitatory conditioned stimulus is increased if it is immediately preceded by an inhibitory one, and to negative induction, in which the response to an inhibitory conditioned stimulus is increased if it is immediately preceded by an excitatory one. 
- (5) The process whereby morphogenic differentiation is stimulated in a developing embryo by MÃ¼llerian inhibiting substance, testosterone, or other hormones or substances. 
- (6) A formal process of introduction to membership of a group or organization. 
- (7) A shortened name for enzyme induction. induce $v b$. inductive adj. \[From Latin inducere to lead in, from in in + ducere, inductum to lead + -ion indicating an action, process, or state]
