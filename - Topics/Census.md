Censuses are normally carried out by official bodies, by means of questionnaires, reply to which is compulsory. In the UK censuses are normally held every ten years; the most recent was in 2011. Information is collected on personal characteristics such as age, sex, family status, and occupation; censuses may also collect information on other topics such as housing conditions, mobility, language, ethnic grouping, or religion.

- An official count of a population for demographic, social, or economic purposes. In the UK, population censuses have been held every ten years since 1801 and since 1966 supplementary censuses have been held halfway through the ten-year periods. A census of distribution, quantifying the wholesale and retail distribution, has been carried out approximately every five years since 1950. A census of production, recording the output of all manufacturing, mining, quarrying, and building industries, together with that of all public services, has been held every year since 1968.

- $n$. an official count of the population within a defined territory, together with information on such attributes as age, sex, etc. In the UK it takes the form of a ten-yearly enumeration of the population based on the actual presence of individuals in a house or institution on a designated night (known as a de facto census). This contrasts with the approach in the USA, where enumeration is based on official address (de jure census).
