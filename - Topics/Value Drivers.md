- Value drivers are produced or created by a business to help them gain market share, expand their customer base, or boost revenue. A value driver may refer to a specific service or product produced by a business, but can also refer to something less tangible, such as a unique method of delivering a product or a particular attribute in which a business has a major advantage.
