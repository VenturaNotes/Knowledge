- A type of bond that offers no interest payments. In effect, the interest is paid at maturity in the redemption value of the bond. Investors sometimes prefer zero-coupon bonds as they may confer more favorable tax treatment. A zero-coupon bond is the ultimate deep-discount bond (see DEEPLY DISCOUNTED SECURITY). See also TIGR; ZEBRA.
