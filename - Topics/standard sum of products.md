- One of the two canonical (i.e. standard or normal) forms of a Boolean function, useful in comparing and simplifying functions. This form contains one standard product term, or minterm, for each 'one' (true) entry in the truth table for the expression. This form can be represented as the OR (sum) of a group of ANDs (the product terms) of Boolean variables, uncomplemented or complemented. It can also be shown to be the NAND of a group of NANDs of the identical variables. Compare STANDARD PRODUCT OF SUMS.
