- Vendors are a crucial part of day-to-day business operations but can present problems when it comes to IT matters and industry laws or regulations. When finding a new vendor, companies must assess the risk associated with each one to mitigate potential negative impacts on their business. To do this successfully, vendor risk management (VRM) strategies are used. VRM is an in-depth process but typically includes processes like investigating the vendor's cyber-security measures, ensuring that they can remain compliant with industry needs (such as HIPPA for health-care businesses), and reviewing their data breach notification policies.
