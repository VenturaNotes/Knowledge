- (cerebral gigantism) a rare inherited disorder resulting in excessive physical growth during the first 2-3 years of life. It presents in childhood with a characteristic facial appearance, a disproportionately large head, large hands and feet, abnormally widely spaced eyes (ocular hypertelorism), developmental delay, and tall stature for age. Children with Sotos syndrome tend to be large at birth and taller and heavier, stabilizing after about five years to achieve normal adult height. Most cases occur sporadically, although familial cases have been reported. \[J. F. Sotos (1927- ), U.S. paediatrician]
