- adj. In psychometrics, a property of a multi-score measuring instrument in which responses that increase one of the scores necessarily reduce one or more of the others, so that the various scores must be interpreted relative to one another rather than in absolute terms. For example, the Edwards Personal Preference Schedule (EPPS) measures 15 needs, but by endorsing items pertaining to certain needs, a respondent necessarily rejects items pertaining to others, and it is impossible to score high (or low) on all the needs. Compare normative (2). \[From Latin ipso facto by that very fact, so called because a high score on one scale by that very fact implies a lower score on another]
