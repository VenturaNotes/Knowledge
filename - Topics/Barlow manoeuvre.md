- a test for congenital dislocation of the hip that detects whether or not a hip can be readily dislocated. With the baby lying supine and the pelvis steadied with one hand, the hip being tested is gently adducted and backward pressure is applied to the head of the femur. If the hip is dislocatable, a clunk will be felt and sometimes heard (Von Rosen's sign). If the hip is gently abducted, it will usually relocate. \[T. Barlow (1845-1945), British physician]
