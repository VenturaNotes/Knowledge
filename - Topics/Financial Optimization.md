- Financial optimization is the process of ensuring business funds are allocated most cost-effectively. This could mean spending more in the short term to enjoy savings later down the line. At times, it could also involve running a product at a loss to engage more customers, boost brand loyalty, and increase the sale or uptake of future products or services. One example of financial optimization is switching to lightbulbs and heating technology that save energy. Over time, these devices will result in cost savings for businesses.
