- A data structure whose organizational characteristics are invariant throughout its lifetime. Such structures are well supported by high-level languages and familiar examples are arrays and records. The prime features of static structures are
	- (a) none of the structural information need be stored explicitly within the elements-it is often held in a distinct logical/physical header;
	- (b) the elements of an allocated structure are physically contiguous, held in a single segment of memory;
	- (c) all descriptive information, other than the physical location of the allocated structure, is determined by the structure definition;
	- (d) relationships between elements do not change during the lifetime of the structure.
- Relaxation of these features leads to the concept of a dynamic data structure.
