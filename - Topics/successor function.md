- 1. The function SUCC that occurs in programming languages such as Ada or Pascal and produces the next element of an enumeration type. Typically $$\begin{align}&SUCC(4) \text{ produces }5 \\ &SUCC('A')\text{ produces } 'B' \end{align}$$
- (2) The function $$\begin{align}&S: N \to N \\ &\text{for which }S(n) = n+1\end{align}$$where $N$ is the nonnegative integers. $S$ plays a crucial role in recursive function theory, particularly in the definition of primitive recursive functions.
