- Coset of a group G that possess a subgroup H. A coset of G modulo H determined by the element $x$ of G is a subset: $$\begin{align}&x\degree H = \{x\degree h|h \in H\}\\ &H\degree x = \{h\degree x|h \in H\}\end{align}$$where $\degree$ is the dyadic operation defined on G. A subset of the former kind is called a [[left coset]] of G modulo H or a left coset of G in H; the latter is a [[right coset]]. In special cases $$x\degree H = H\degree x$$for any x in G. Then H is called a normal subgroup of G. Any subgroup of an abelian group is a normal subgroup
- The cosets of G in H form a partition of the group G, each coset showing the same number of elements as H itself. These can be viewed as the equivalence classes of a left [[coset relation]] defined on the elements $g_1$ and $g_2$ of G as follows: $$g_1\space \rho \space g_2 \text { iff } g_1 \degree H = g_2 \degree H$$Similarly a right coset relation can be defined. When H is a normal subgroup the coset relation becomes a congruence relation.
- Cosets have important applications in computer science, e.g. in the development of efficient codes needed in the transmission of information and in the design of fast adders.
