- The mechanism of movement demonstrated by Amoeba spp. and other cells that are capable of changing their shape (e.g. phagocytes). The cytoplasm of Amoeba spp. consists of a central fluid plasmasol surrounded by a more viscous plasmagel. The plasmagel is converted to plasmasol, which slides towards the front of the cell, forming a pseudopodium and propelling the cell forward. On reaching the tip of the pseudopodium, this plasmasol is reconverted into plasmagel; at the same time the plasmagel at the rear of the cell is converted into plasmasol and streams forward, thus maintaining continuous movement.
- Amoeboid movement is brought about by reversible changes in the actin filaments of the cell's cytoskeleton. Cross-linking of these filaments by other proteins creates a threedimensional network with gel-like properties in the plasmagel region. Disassembly of this network causes reversion to the sol state of plasmasol.
