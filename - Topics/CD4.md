- a surface antigen on helper T cells that is particularly important for immune resistance to viruses. It is also a receptor for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); progressive reduction of CD4-bearing T cells reflects the progression of AIDS.
## Source[^2]
- A surface glycoprotein that characterizes helper T cells. CD4 recognizes foreign peptides bound to MHC class II proteins expressed on the surface of B cells, macrophages, and other antigen-presenting cells. It acts as a coreceptor, binding simultaneously with the T-cell receptor to the antigen-MHC II complex and enhancing the T-cell's response. CD4 consists of a single polypeptide chain organized into four immunoglobulin-like domains.
