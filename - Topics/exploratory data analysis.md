- aka EDA
- An approach to data analysis that sets out initially to explore the data, usually through a variety of mostly graphical techniques, to try to gain insight into the nature of the data and their underlying structure, what the important variables are and to identify outliers. The outcomes can then inform decisions as to what analyses are appropriate. The approach first gained importance with the work of Tukey in 1977.
## Source[^2]
- A term invented by J. W. Tukey to denote techniques for looking at numerical data with a view to discerning pattern. Exploratory data analysis is open-ended and makes few prior assumptions about the nature of any pattern that may be found. Graphical techniques are freely used. It can be contrasted with model-fitting techniques, which make highly specific prior assumptions. Statistical methods contain aspects of both these processes.
