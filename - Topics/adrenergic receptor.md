- $n$. Either of two types of neuroreceptor for adrenalin (epinephrine) and noradrenalin (norepinephrine) situated on a neuron, muscle, or gland. Alpha-adrenergic (or $\alpha$-adrenergic) receptors, which are found in smooth muscles that line blood vessels, can raise blood pressure by constricting them, and beta-adrenergic (or $\beta$-adrenergic) receptors, which are found in membranes surrounding the heart muscle and the smooth muscles of the lungs and intestines, function by activating slightly different second messenger pathways. In most cases, alpha receptors are associated with excitation of the smooth muscles, and beta receptors with inhibition, but the muscles of the heart have beta receptors that are excitatory and some of the alpha receptors in the intestines are inhibitory.
