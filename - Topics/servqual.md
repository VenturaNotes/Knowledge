- The provision of high-quality products together with a high quality of customer service. It can be identified by a number of factors:
	- tangibles, i.e. physical evidence of the service;
	- reliability, i.e. consistency of performance and dependability;
	- responsiveness, i.e. a readiness on the part of employees to provide a prompt service;
	- assurance, i.e. competence, credibility, and access to those employees providing the service;
	- empathy, i.e. understanding the customers' needs as well as communicating with them considerately and respectfully.
- Servqual provides an important differentiated marketing strategy. It has been repeatedly shown that providing consumers with a high level of service, combined with high-quality products, affects consumer satisfaction, which is reflected in their buying behavior. Companies providing outstanding servqual undoubtedly achieve greater sales and profits. While servqual is difficult to quantify, many companies are anxious to know how consumers assess it, especially in terms of comparing their expectations with actual performance. If consumers' expectations do not match the actual level of service provided, a 'gap' is created. If the gap is negative it can be the cause of serious consumer dissatisfaction. On the other hand, a 'positive gap' implies that consumers' expectations are exceeded by the servqual provided, which should be the objective of every company. "We exceed your expectations" is a slogan often used in advertising. Similarly, management's perception of the consumers' expectations, rather than the consumers' actual expectations, can create a further gap.
