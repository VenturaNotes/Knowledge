## Source[^2]
- (human immunodeficiency virus) The retrovirus that causes AIDS in humans. It has a specific affinity for the helper T cells of its host, binding to CD4 antigens on the cell surface and thereby disabling these cells. The membrane envelope glycoproteins encasing the virus show great variability in their amino-acid sequences, hence the difficulty of preparing an effective AIDS vaccine. Two varieties (serovars) are known: HIV-1 and HIV-2. The latter, which is less virulent, is found chiefly in Africa. HIV is thought to have originated from chimpanzees in central Africa.
