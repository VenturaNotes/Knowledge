- $n$. One of two types of neuroreceptors for acetylcholine found in the central nervous system and the parasympathetic branch of the peripheral nervous system, stimulated by muscarine and inhibited by atropine. The smooth muscles that are target organs of the autonomic nervous system (such as the pupils, blood vessels, and glands) use muscarinic receptors. Also called a muscarinic cholinoceptor. Compare NICOTINIC RECEPTOR. \[From Latin muscarius the alkaloid poison muscarine found in some mushrooms, so named because muscarine mimics acetylcholine at such a site]
