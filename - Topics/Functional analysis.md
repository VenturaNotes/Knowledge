- By looking at infinite dimensional spaces in a linear algebra sense and you want to apply some analysis on these spaces, then you are in the realm of functional analysis
- Consider [[Function space|function spaces]], [[Sequence space|sequence spaces]] and [[linear maps]] between [[Subspace|subspaces]]
	- #question what other kind of maps are there aside from linear?
		- #question Is that why distance was used as the first example?
- In this field, we combine algebraic structures with analytic properties
- Functional analysis is the study of topological-algebraic structures
- A normal analysis course starts with [[metric space|metric spaces]]
