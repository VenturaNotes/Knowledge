- A tax in which the rate of tax increases with increases in the tax base. In the UK, the most obvious such tax is income tax but progressive rates are also applied to National Insurance contributions, inheritance tax, and to a limited extent corporation tax. Such taxes are generally justified on the ability-to-pay principle. Compare FLAT TAX; REGRESSIVE TAX.
