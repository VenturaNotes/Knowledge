- (light reflex) the reflex change in the size of the pupil according to the amount of light entering the eye. Bright light reaching the retina stimulates nerves of the parasympathetic nervous system, which cause the pupil to contract. In dim light the pupil opens, due to stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. See also IRIS.
## Source[^2]
- An alteration in the size of the pupil in response to a change in the light intensity. An increase in light intensity causes both pupils to contract (see IRIS) even if only one retina is directly stimulated. This is known as a consensual reflex. Conversely, a decrease in light intensity causes dilation of the pupils.
