- A fold of membrane that attaches the intestine to the wall around the stomach area and holds it in place

## Source[^2]
- A thin sheet of tissue, bounded on each side by peritoneum, that supports the gut and other organs in the body cavities of animals. Vertebrates have a well-developed dorsal mesentery that anchors the stomach and intestine and contains blood vessels and nerves supplying the gut. The reproductive organs and their ducts are also supported by mesenteries.
