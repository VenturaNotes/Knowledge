## Source [^1]
- A physical connection between two or more devices (called nodes or stations) by a communication channel that appears 'wirelike', i.e. bits arrive in the order sent. Coaxial cables, telephone lines, optical fibres, lasers, and even satellite channels can be data links. Data links are assumed to be susceptible to noise (i.e. have error properties) and have finite data rate and nonzero propagation delay.
