## Source [^1]
- The part of a plant that usually grows vertically upwards towards the light and supports the leaves, buds, and reproductive structures (see illustration). The leaves develop at the nodes and side or branch stems develop from buds at the nodes. The stems of certain species are modified as bulbs, corms, rhizomes, and tubers. Some species have twining stems; others have horizontal stems, such as runners. Another modification is the cladode. Erect stems may be cylindrical or angular; they may be covered with hairs, prickles, or spines and many exhibit secondary growth and become woody (see GROWTH RING). In addition to its supportive function, the stem contains vascular tissue that conducts food, water, and mineral salts between the roots and leaves. It may also contain chloroplasts and carry out photosynthesis.
