- A method of rendering realistic shading on bumpy surfaces without actually rendering a full three-dimensional model of the bumps. The surface is treated as smooth for the purpose of visible surface determination. The appearance of bumps or roughness is created by perturbation of the surface normals. See also DISPLACEMENT MAPPING.
