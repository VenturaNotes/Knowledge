- The division between those elements of an operating system that are transparent to the customer and with which they can interact (front office), and those that are hidden (back office). In the service sector there is a trade-off between the benefits that accrue from close and open relationships with the customer and the greater ease with which operations can be controlled when they are out of sight. Application of information technology to many service operations has allowed the customer to experience what appears to be a customized service, while at the same time allowing standardization of procedures.
