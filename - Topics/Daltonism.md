## Source[^2]
- $n$. The most common type of color-blindness, occurring in about 7 or 8 per cent of males and 0.4 per cent of females, usually a form of deuteranomaly or deuteranopia resulting in a defective ability to distinguish reds from greens, caused by a recessive X-linked gene and expressed predominantly in males, because they have only one X chromosome and therefore complementation cannot occur. Also called red-green color-blindness . See also Horner's law. \[Named after the English chemist and physicist John Dalton (1766-1844) who was red-green color-blind and gave the first account of his condition in 1794, describing blood as appearing similar in color to objects usually described as bottle-green]
