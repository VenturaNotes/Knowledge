- A network access point is typically a piece of equipment that other devices use to connect to the internet. Some wireless routers serve as NAPS, but NAP-specific devices cannot function as routers. A network access point accesses the local area network created by a router. From there, other devices can connect to the NAP to improve connectivity.
