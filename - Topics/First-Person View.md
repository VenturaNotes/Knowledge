- First-person view (FPV) can be defined as any graphical perspective rendered from the viewpoint of a character in a video game, a drone, or other types of virtual entities. First-person view allows users to explore virtual environments that differ from their own, as if they were in it themselves. First-person view is commonly used in virtual reality, video games, film, and photography to grant users access to environments that they may not be able to access otherwise.
