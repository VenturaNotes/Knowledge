- A simple form of precedence hierarchy, used in APL, in which operators are taken in the order in which they appear in the expression. Each operator takes everything to the right as its right operand, thus$$a* b+c$$evaluates as $$a*(b+c)$$Note that, paradoxically, left-to-right precedence actually causes operators to be applied in right-to-left sequence.
