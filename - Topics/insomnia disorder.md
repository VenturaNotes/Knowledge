- $n$. A sleep-wake disorder characterized by insomnia: either difficulty in falling asleep or maintaining sleep or early morning waking with difficulty in going back to sleep. In DSM-5, diagnostic criteria for the disorder require that the sleep difficulty causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, educational, academic, or other areas of life, occurs on at least three nights per week, has persisted for at least three months, and is not better explained by narcolepsy or another sleep-wake disorder, drug abuse, or medication. According to DSM-5, about 33 per cent of adults report some symptoms of insomnia and between 6 and 10 per cent meet the diagnostic criteria of the disorder.
