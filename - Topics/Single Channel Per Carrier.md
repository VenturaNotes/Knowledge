- Single Channel Per Carrier refers to an older telecommunications network. In this network, one channel is associated with one carrier, which made it impossible for multiple channels to use the same carrier. As a result, SCPC networks were much more limited than what is available today for commercial communications. SCPC networks are still used in some limited forms. For example, satellite radio and some voice transmissions still use a single channel per carrier network.
