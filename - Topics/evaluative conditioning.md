- $n$. An increase or decrease in liking occurring as a consequence of associative learning or classical conditioning, first reported by the Russian-born US psychologist Gregory Razran (1901-73) in an article in the journal Psychological Bulletin in 1940. Participants rated a series of political slogans (considered as conditioned stimuli) on a like$\textendash$dislike rating scale, and were later asked to rate the slogans a second time. Those who performed the second rating in the context of a free lunch (considered as an unconditioned stimulus) rated the slogans significantly more positively than others who performed the second rating while being exposed to an unpleasant smell. The term evaluative conditioning was introduced in 1975 by the Canadian-born British psychologist Archie B(anks) Levey (1924-2012) and the English psychologist Irene Martin (1926-2009) in an article in the journal Behavior Research and Therapy that also popularized the picture-picture technique.
