- (nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug) any one of a large group of drugs used for pain relief, particularly in rheumatic disease associated with inflammation but also in dysmenorrhoea and metastatic bone disease. NSAIDs act by inhibiting the cyclo-oxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) responsible for controlling the formation of prostaglandins, which are important mediators of inflammation. They include aspirin, ibuprofen, ketoprofen, and naproxen. Adverse effects include gastrointestinal bleeding and ulceration. Some NSAIDs act by selectively inhibiting COX-2 and are therefore less likely to cause gastric side-effects (see COX-2 INHIBITOR).
