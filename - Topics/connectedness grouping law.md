- $n$. A perceptual grouping law formulated in 1990 by the US psychologists Irvin Rock (1922-95) and Stephen E. Palmer (born 1948) to explain the organization of parts into wholes by the visual system. According to the law, the perceptual system has a tendency to perceive any uniform, connected line or area as a single unit, so that the array$$O-O ~O-O ~O-O ~O-O$$tends to be perceived as being composed of four rather than eight or twelve elements. See also Pr√§gnanz. Compare Closure Grouping law, COMMON fate, COMMON REGION, GOOD CONTINUATION, PROXIMITY GROUPING LAW, SIMILARITY GROUPING LAW.
