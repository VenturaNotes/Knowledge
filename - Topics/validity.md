- $n$. an indication of the extent to which a measure (e.g. a clinical sign or test) is a true indicator of what it purports to measure (e.g. disease). Reduced validity can arise if the test produces different results when conducted several times on the same person under identical conditions (i.e. reduced reproducibility, reliability, or repeatability). This may be because the same observer gets different results on successive occasions (intraobserver error) or because a series of different observers fail to obtain the same result (interobserver error). Such errors may arise because of a true difference in observation and/or interpretation or because of a preconceived notion (often unconscious) by the observer, which influences his or her behavior.
