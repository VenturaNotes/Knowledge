- For a set S in a topological space X, a point $x$ (which is in $X$ but not necessarily in $S$) is an accumulation point of $S$ if every neighborhood of $x$ in $X$ also contains an element of $S$ distinct from $x$. Also called cluster point or limit point. The closure of a set is the union of the set and the set of accumulation points. See derived set, adherent point.
