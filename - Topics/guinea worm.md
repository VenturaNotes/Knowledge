- a nematode worm, Dracunculus medinensis, that is a parasite of humans. The white threadlike adult female, $60-120 \mathrm{~cm}$ long, lives in the connective tissues beneath the skin. It releases its larvae into a large blister on the legs or arms; when the limbs are immersed in water the larvae escape and are subsequently eaten by tiny water fleas (Cyclops), inside which their development continues. The disease dracontiasis results from drinking water contaminated with Cyclops.
