- The markets where foreign exchange is traded. This includes both spot markets, for immediate delivery, and futures markets for delivery on future dates at pre-arranged prices.

A Bank of International Settlements survey from April 2016 reported the daily turnover on foreign exchange markets to be $\$ 5.1$ trillion.
