- Succession planning and management ensures that when someone takes over an area of a business, it occurs smoothly, minimizing any negative impact on the business. This means being prepared for a change in leadership before it happens, and includes having recruitment pipelines or a pool of talent so there is always someone to take the helm on business-critical projects.
