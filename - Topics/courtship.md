- Behavior in animals that plays a part in the initial attraction of a mate or as a prelude to copulation. Courtship involves signals that guide the behavior of the participants and often takes the form of displays that have evolved through ritualization; some are derived from other contexts (e.g. food begging in some birds). Auditory and chemical stimuli (see PHEROMONE) are also important in many mammals and insects, especially nocturnal species.
- As well as ensuring that the prospective mate is of the same species, the male's courtship performance allows females to choose between different males. The later stages of courtship may involve both partners in an alternating series of displays that inhibit aggression and fear responses and ensure synchrony of sexual arousal. See also SEXUAL SELECTION.
