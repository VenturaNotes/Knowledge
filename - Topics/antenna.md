- (pl. antennae) A long whiplike jointed mobile paired appendage on the head of many arthropods, usually concerned with the senses of smell, touch, etc. (see SENSILLUM). In insects, millipedes, and centipedes they are the first pair of head appendages and are specialized and modified in many insects. In crustaceans they are the second pair of head appendages, the first pair (the antennules) having the sensory function, while the antennae are modified for swimming and for attachment.
