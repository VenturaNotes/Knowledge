- The continuous probability distribution with probability density function $f(x) = \lambda\text{exp}(-\lambda x),$ where $\lambda > 0$ and $x \ge 0$. It has mean $1/\lambda$ and variance $1/\lambda^2$. The time between events that occur randomly but at a constant rate has an exponential distribution. The distribution is skewed to the right.
