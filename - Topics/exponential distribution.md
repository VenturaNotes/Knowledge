- The continuous probability distribution with probability density function $f(x) = \lambda\text{exp}(-\lambda x),$ where $\lambda > 0$ and $x \ge 0$. It has mean $1/\lambda$ and variance $1/\lambda^2$. The time between events that occur randomly but at a constant rate has an exponential distribution. The distribution is skewed to the right.
## Source[^2]
- exponential distribution A special case of the gamma distribution with the density function$$f(x \mid \beta)=\frac{1}{\beta} e^{-x / \beta}$$for $0 \leq x<\infty$ and $\beta>0$, and the moment generating function $M(t)=\frac{\beta}{\beta-t}$ for any $t<\beta$. An exponential random variable has mean $\beta$ and variance $\beta^{2}$. This distribution has the memoryless property and is frequently used to model lifetimes and queuing problems.
