- A class of consumer durables that includes washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators, tumble-dryers, deep-freezers, and cookers; they are so named because they are usually finished in white enamel paint, although browns and other colors are now being used to make them fit less starkly into modern kitchens. Compare BROWN GOODS.
