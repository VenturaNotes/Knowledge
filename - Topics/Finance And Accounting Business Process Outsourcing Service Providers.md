- Business process outsourcing (BPO) is a common strategy of partnering with a third party to outsource a business function for which a company doesnâ€™t want to hire a full-time employee or team. Finance and accounting BPO service providers are third-party providers who take over one or multiple financial functions of a business. These functions could include accounts payable and accounts receivable management, treasury management, cash management, general ledger work, tax accountancy, shareholder accountancy, or specialist financial functions unique to the business.
