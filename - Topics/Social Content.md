- Social content is a form of media created with the intention of human entertainment, knowledge, or consumption. Videos and photos are two examples. This content appears on social platforms such as Instagram or Snapchat, but it's also anything that fans create and share with their friends through private channelsâ€”texts, emails, or even in-person conversations. Social content is often referred to as UGC (user-generated content) or owned and earned media.
