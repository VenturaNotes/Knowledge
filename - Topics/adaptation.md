## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An inherited trait that is selected for over time because it allows organisms to better survive in their environment
- Adaptation is when organisms develop certain traits that help them survive better in their environment and get passed down through generations

## Source[^2]
- Policies and actions to prevent or reduce the adverse effects of climate change. Examples of adaptation policies include building flood defences and developing resilient crops. The European Commission adopted an EU Adaptation Plan in 2013 to facilitate coordination among the EU member countries in developing and implementing adaptation strategies. See also MITIGATION.

- 1. (in evolution) Any change in the structure or functioning of successive generations of a population that makes it better suited to its environment. Natural selection of heritable adaptations ultimately leads to the development of new species. Increasing adaptation of a species to a particular environment tends to diminish its ability to adapt to any sudden change in that environment. 
- 2. (in physiology) The alteration in the degree of sensitivity (either an increase or a decrease) of a sense organ to suit conditions more extreme than normally encountered. An example is the adjustment of the eye to vision in very bright or very dim light.

- $n$. 
- (1) In the theory of evolution, a feature of an organism's structure, physiology, or behavior that solves a problem in its life or helps it to pass its genes on to the next generation. 
- (2) In physiology and sensation, a temporary reduction in the responsiveness of a sensory receptor other than a pain receptor as a result of repeated or continuous stimulation. Also called sensory adaptation . See also auditory adaptation, chromatic ADAPTATION, CROSS-ADAPTATION, DARK ADAPTATION, LIGHT ADAPTATION, ODOUR ADAPTATION, PRISM ADAPTATION, THERMAL ADAPTATION, TRANSIENT TRITANOPIA, VISUAL ADAPTATION. 
- (3) In the writings of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980), the modification of an organism's psychological structures or processes in response to environmental demands, comprising accommodation (2) and assimilation (2). See also equilibration. 
- (4) A general term for any process whereby behavior or subjective experience alters to fit in with a changed environment or circumstances or in response to social pressure. Often mistakenly written or pronounced as adaption. See also alloplastic, autoplastic. adaptive adj. \[From Latin adaptare to adjust or to fit, from ad to + aptus fitting + -ion indicating an action, process, or state]
## Source[^5]
- $n$. 
- (1) the phenomenon in which a sense organ shows a gradually diminishing response to continuous or repetitive stimulation. The nose, for example, may become adapted to the stimulus of an odour that is continuously present so that in time it ceases to report its presence. Similarly, the adaptation of touch receptors in the skin means that the presence of clothes can be forgotten a few minutes after they have been put on. 
- (2) a process of change to enable adjustment to a condition or environment.
