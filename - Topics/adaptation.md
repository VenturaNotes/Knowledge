## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An inherited trait that is selected for over time because it allows organisms to better survive in their environment
- Adaptation is when organisms develop certain traits that help them survive better in their environment and get passed down through generations

## Source[^2]
- Policies and actions to prevent or reduce the adverse effects of climate change. Examples of adaptation policies include building flood defences and developing resilient crops. The European Commission adopted an EU Adaptation Plan in 2013 to facilitate coordination among the EU member countries in developing and implementing adaptation strategies. See also MITIGATION.

## Source[^3]
- 1. (in evolution) Any change in the structure or functioning of successive generations of a population that makes it better suited to its environment. Natural selection of heritable adaptations ultimately leads to the development of new species. Increasing adaptation of a species to a particular environment tends to diminish its ability to adapt to any sudden change in that environment. 
- 2. (in physiology) The alteration in the degree of sensitivity (either an increase or a decrease) of a sense organ to suit conditions more extreme than normally encountered. An example is the adjustment of the eye to vision in very bright or very dim light.
