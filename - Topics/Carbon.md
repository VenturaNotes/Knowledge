- Symbol C. A nonmetallic element that occurs in all organic compounds and is therefore fundamental to the structure of all living organisms. It is an essential element for plants and animals, being ultimately derived from atmospheric carbon dioxide assimilated by plants during photosynthesis (see carbon CYCLE). The ubiquitous nature of carbon in living organisms is due to its unique ability to form stable covalent bonds with other carbon atoms and also with hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and sulphur atoms, resulting in the formation of a variety of compounds containing chains and rings of carbon atoms.
- There are two stable isotopes of carbon (proton numbers 12 and 13) and four radioactive ones (10, 11, 14, 15). Carbon-14 is used in carbon dating. See also IsOTOPIC DISCRIMINATION; ISOTOPIC SIGNATURE.
