- The posterior region of the body trunk of animals. In vertebrates it contains the stomach and intestines and the organs of excretion and reproduction. It is particularly well defined in mammals, being separated from the thorax by the diaphragm. In many arthropods, such as insects and spiders, it may be segmented.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. the part of the body cavity below the chest (see THORAX), from which it is separated by the diaphragm. The abdomen contains the organs of digestion - stomach, liver, intestines, etc. - and excretion - kidneys, bladder, etc.; in women it also contains the ovaries and uterus. The regions and quadrants of the abdomen are shown in the illustration: the four quadrants, demarcated by broken lines, are the right upper (RUQ), right lower (RLQ), left upper (LUQ), and left lower (LLQ). Terms to designate the regions are those used in day-to-day medical practice rather than in anatomy textbooks. $\textemdash$abdominal adj.
