- A service offered by most unit-trust managements and life assurance companies, in which the trust or company takes over a client's shareholding and invests the proceeds in unit-trust funds, etc., of the client's choice. The client is thereby saved the trouble and expense of disposing of his shares and if the shares are absorbed into the trust's or company's own portfolio he may receive a better price than he would on the market (i.e. he may receive the offer price rather than the bid price).
