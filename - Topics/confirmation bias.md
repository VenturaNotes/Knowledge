- $n$. The tendency to test one's beliefs or conjectures by seeking evidence that might confirm or verify them and to ignore evidence that might disconfirm or refute them. This bias, which helps to maintain prejudices and stereotypes, is clearly manifested in problem-solvers' behaviour in the Wason selection task and the 2-4-6 problem. See also falsifiability, Hempel's paradox, logical positivism. Compare matching BIAS.
