- $n$. In statistics, a graph used to detect departures from normality in a set of scores whose cumulative proportion at various points is plotted against the expected cumulative proportion based on the normal distribution of standardized (1) scores. The points should fall close to a straight line if the scores are a sample from a normal distribution. See also DETRENDED NORMAL PLOT.
