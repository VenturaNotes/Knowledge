## Source[^2]
- $n$. Buprenorphine hydrochloride, an opiate partial antagonist (3) that acts by binding to opiate neuroreceptors in the brain, causing analgesia, euphoria, and other effects. Though much less potent than heroin and other narcotic antagonists, it remains attached to the receptors long after it has disappeared from the bloodstream, making it useful in the treatment of addiction to heroin and other opiates. At low doses, it enables addicted people to avoid such drugs without experiencing withdrawal symptoms. In 2002, the US Food and Drug Administration approved it as a medication for the treatment of drug addiction. Formula: $\mathrm{C}_{29} \mathrm{H}_{41} \mathrm{NO}_{4} \mathrm{HCl}$. Also called Buprenex or Subutex (trademarks). See also Suboxone. \[Named after morphine]
