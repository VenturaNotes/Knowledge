- Application performance monitoring (APM) is a strategy used to understand how applications function. The process involves any technique or tool, like real-time analytics, application mapping, and diagnostics, that aids in tracking how an application operates and how users interact with the application. APM expands beyond the basics and provides a complete overview and analysis of the applicationâ€™s latency, failures, and bugs. The goal of APM is to ensure that an application runs efficiently and provides a positive customer experience.
