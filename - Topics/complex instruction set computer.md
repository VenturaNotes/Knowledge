## Source [^1]
- A conventional computer in which the instruction set has evolved to satisfy the needs of high-level languages and system software to enable generation of compact efficient object code, often in a time-sharing environment governed by an operating system. Compare RISC.
## Source[^2]
- Complex instruction set computer (CISC) is a type of computing system architecture that is packed with every possible instruction a computer could be expected to use. Since all functions are stored within one computing system, functions may run slowly. Also, each function has numerous steps, which further slows the computing speed. CISC is considered an outdated architecture. Its modern alternative is reduced instruction set computer (RISC). In RISC computing setups with high volumes of functions, each function is more efficient with fewer steps.
