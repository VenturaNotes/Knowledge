- Mobile device management (MDM) refers to a type of software that works with portable devices. This can include laptops, phones, tablets, and more. An MDM will handle many facets of mobile device distribution. It will typically manage upgrades, security, and accessibility. It will also ensure that all devices are being used in compliance with company policy. MDM is typically managed by the third-party or IT division of a company. MDMs can also be used to monitor device locations, and potentially wipe a device if it becomes stolen or lost.
