- pl. n. a class of drugs that inhibit the resorption of bone by blocking the action of osteoclasts. This property makes them useful for treating certain bone disorders, such as Paget's disease and osteoporosis, as well as malignant disease $\textendash$ both in terms of pain relief and in treating hypercalcaemia due to cancer. There is a risk of osteonecrosis of the jaw in patients receiving bisphosphonates for cancer. This risk is increased by tooth extraction. Bisphosphonates include alendronic acid, etidronate, pamidronate disodium, risedronate, clodronate, and zoledronic acid.
