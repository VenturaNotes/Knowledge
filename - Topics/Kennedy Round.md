- The round of international trade talks held under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in 1964-7. The round was named after US President John F. Kennedy (1917-1963). The agreement cut tariffs on most world trade in manufactures by about a third, implemented over the following five years. No agreement was reached on agricultural protection, or on non-tariff barriers to trade.
