- $n$. a drug that has the effect of stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system. The actions of parasympathomimetic drugs are cholinergic (resembling those of acetylcholine) and include stimulation of skeletal muscle, vasodilatation, depression of heart rate, increasing the tension of smooth muscle, increasing secretions (such as saliva), and constricting the pupil of the eye. They are used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (see ANTICHOLINESTERASE) and glaucoma (see MIOTIC).
