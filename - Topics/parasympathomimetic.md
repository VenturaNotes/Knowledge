- $n$. a drug that has the effect of stimulating the parasympathetic nervous system. The actions of parasympathomimetic drugs are cholinergic (resembling those of acetylcholine) and include stimulation of skeletal muscle, vasodilatation, depression of heart rate, increasing the tension of smooth muscle, increasing secretions (such as saliva), and constricting the pupil of the eye. They are used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis (see ANTICHOLINESTERASE) and glaucoma (see MIOTIC).

- adj. n. (Of, relating to, or having an effect similar to) a drug such as carbachol, methacholine, or muscarine that mimics or increases the activity of acetylcholine, the major neurotransmitter of the parasympathetic nervous system, with effects such as constriction of the pupils of the eyes and preparation for close-up vision, salivation, slowing of the heart, secretion of gastric juices, and voiding of urine. Compare parasympatholytic, sympathomimetic. See also cholinergic. \[From Greek para beside + syn with + pathos suffering + mimetes an imitator + -ikos of, relating to, or resembling]
