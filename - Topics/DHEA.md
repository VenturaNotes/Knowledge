- abbrev. Dehydroepiandrosterone, a steroid hormone that is produced by the adrenal cortex and is often called the mother (or grandmother) of hormones because it functions as a precursor of many other hormones, including cortisone, oestrogen, progesterone, and testosterone. It plays a part in weight control, and its decline with age is believed to account for some of the diseases of old age. Formula: $\mathrm{C}_{19} \mathrm{H}_{28} \mathrm{O}_{2}$.
