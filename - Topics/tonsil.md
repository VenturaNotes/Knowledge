- A mass of lymphoid tissue, several of which are situated at the back of the mouth and throat in higher vertebrates. In humans there are the palatine tonsils at the back of the mouth, lingual tonsils below the tongue, and pharyngeal tonsils (or adenoids) in the pharynx. They are concerned with the production of lymphocytes and form part of the gutassociated lymphoid tissue protecting the gut against infection.
