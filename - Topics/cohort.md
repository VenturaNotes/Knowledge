- $n$. A group of people who share some experience or demographic trait in common, especially that of being the same age (an age cohort). A cohort study is a type of research design in which a cohort of individuals is investigated repeatedly over an extended period. A cohort effect is a potentially misleading conclusion about developmental changes derived from a cross-sectional study, such as the conclusion that individual IQs decline precipitately from about 20 years of age, a finding that is in fact due to younger cohorts having higher average IQs than older ones (see Flynn EFFECT). \[From Latin cohors company of soldiers]
