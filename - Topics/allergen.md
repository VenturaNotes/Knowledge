## Source[^2]
- $n$. any antigen that causes allergy in a hypersensitive person. Allergens are diverse and affect different tissues and organs. Pollens, fur, feathers, mould, and dust may cause hay fever; house-dust mites (see Dermatophagoides) have been implicated in some forms of asthma; drugs, dyes, cosmetics, and a host of other chemicals can cause rashes and dermatitis; some food allergies may cause diarrhoea or constipation or simulate acute bacterial food poisoning. When a patient's allergen has been identified (see PATCH TEST), it may be possible to attempt desensitization to alleviate or prevent allergic attacks. -allergenic adj.
