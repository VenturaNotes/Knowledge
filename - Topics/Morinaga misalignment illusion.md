- $n$. A visual illusion in which three or more arrowheads, some pointing to the left and some to the right, aligned with their apexes or tips in vertical straight lines, appear to be out of alignment, with the left-pointing apexes further to the left than the rightpointing ones. Pairs of arrowheads can be constructed such that the apparent misalignment is opposite to what would be expected from the MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion (see illustration). \[Named after the Japanese Gestalt psychologist Shiro Morinaga (1908-64) who first drew attention to it in 1941]

	- Morinaga misalignment illusion. The distance between each of the three pairs of arrowheads is identical, and their apexes are vertically aligned.
