- A branch of mathematics dealing with finite sets and calculations (rather than infinite processes such as taking limits and convergence or differentiation of continuous functions). Its boundaries are not precise but its study includes parts of logic, computer science, statistics, and operations research. Some important problems that may be regarded as part of discrete mathematics are finite sets (see SET), algorithms, graph theory, formal language theory and some topics in abstract algebra.
