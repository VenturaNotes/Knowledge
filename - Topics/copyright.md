- The right to prevent copying. It is a negative right that can be exercised by a copyright holder both by means of civil proceedings and also by seeking a criminal prosecution. Copyright protects the form in which an idea is expressed but not the idea itself. It is the main legal protection for computer-based inventions. Under the WTO agreement all nations agreed to protect computer programs as literary works. Copyright law is now also used to limit the use that can be made of all digitally recorded information (programs, data, databases, etc.) to stop rental of works or use of works by multiple users without the payment of higher royalties.
- There is currently a very active movement to harmonize all the national copyright laws so that a Global Information Infrastructure can be created. This process involves a union of the continental European authorsâ€™ rights systems based upon The Rights of Man with the Anglo-Saxon copyright system found in the USA, UK, Ireland, and the Commonwealth. The net result of this union is increasing power to authors of copyright works who are requiring payment for rental use of their works from publishers who publish on a pay-per-view basis on the Internet.
- No formalities are required to obtain copyright protection for any literary work (including computer programs) although it remains good practice to place a copyright notice in all original works.

- The exclusive right to reproduce artistic, dramatic, literary, or musical work, or to authorize its reproduction by others. Copyright persists for a finite period after the author's death; it can be sold or inherited. It also extends to films and television, and is one of the main forms of intellectual property rights.

- The exclusive right to reproduce or authorize others to reproduce artistic, dramatic, literary, or musical works. It is conferred by the Copyright Act 1988, which also extends to sound broadcasting, cinematograph films, television broadcasts, and computer programs. In EU countries copyright lasts for the author's lifetime plus 70 years from the end of the year of death (or from the end of the year of publication, if later); it can be assigned or transmitted on death. The principal remedies for breach of copyright (see PIRACY) are an action for damages and account of profits or an injunction. It is a criminal offence to make or deal in articles that infringe a copyright.
