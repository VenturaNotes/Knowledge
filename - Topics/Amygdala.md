- (amygdaloid nucleus) $n$. one of the basal ganglia and part of the limbic system: a roughly almond-shaped mass of grey matter deep inside each cerebral hemisphere. It has extensive connections with the olfactory system and sends nerve fibres to the hypothalamus; its functions are concerned with perception of threat, fear, learning, emotion, and memory.

- $n$. An almond-shaped brain structure in the limbic system at the base of the inside of each temporal lobe, contiguous with the olfactory cortex, controlling the experience and expression of emotion and involved in motivation, aggression, feeding, and (through its links with the hippocampus) long-term memory. Electrical stimulation of this area usually produces an intense emotion of fear. Ablation of the amygdala has been used to treat intermittent explosive disorder or other forms of impulsecontrol disorder. Also called the amygdaloid body or amygdaloid complex. See also kindling. amygdalae pl. \[From Latin amygdala an almond, from Greek amygdale an almond]
