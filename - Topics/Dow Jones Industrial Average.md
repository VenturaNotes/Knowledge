- (DJIA) An index of security prices used on the New York Stock Exchange; it is issued by Dow Jones & Co., a US firm providing financial information. The Dow is a narrowly based index, having 30 constituent companies. The index was founded in 1884, based then on 11 stocks (mostly in railways), but was reorganized in 1928 when it was given the value of 100. Its lowest point was on 2 July 1932, when it reached 41. In 2007 it exceeded 14,000. Dow Jones also publishes other indices, and the DJIA is now just one of a number of US stock price indices.
