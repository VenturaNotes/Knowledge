- $n$. Any of a group of organic compounds containing at least one amino group $\left(\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)$ and one carboxyl group $(\mathrm{COOH})$, just 20 of which from among more than 100 that occur in nature forming the component molecules of all peptides, polypeptides, and proteins of which living cells are composed. They include non-essential amino acids, which can be synthesized in the body, and essential amino acids, which cannot be synthesized in the body and must therefore be supplied in the diet. See ASPARtiC ACID, CREATINE, DOPA, GLUTAMIC ACID, GLYCINE, PHENYLALANINE, TRYPTOPHAN, TYROSINE. See also CODON, GENETIC CODE.
## Source[^3]
- an organic compound containing an amino group $\left(-\mathrm{NH}_{2}\right)$ and a carboxyl group ( -COOH ). Amino acids are fundamental constituents of all proteins. They are classified as essential amino acids, i.e. those that cannot be synthesized by the body, and nonessential amino acids, which can be synthesized by the body. Certain amino acids present in the body are not found in proteins; these include citrulline, ornithine, taurine, and gamma-aminobutyric acid.
