## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- the system of dual control of certain activities of the body by means of both nerves and circulating hormones. The functioning of the autonomic nervous system is particularly closely linked to that of the pituitary and adrenal glands. The system can give rise to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which have special structural features and often produce active hormones. See also NEUROHORMONE; NEUROSECRETION.
## Source[^2]
- Any of the systems of dual control of certain activities in animals by nervous and hormonal stimulation. For example, the posterior pituitary gland and the medulla of the adrenal gland receive direct nervous stimulation to secrete their hormones, whereas the anterior pituitary gland is stimulated by releasing hormones from the hypothalamus. Similarly, development, metamorphosis, and moulting in insects are regulated by a neuroendocrine mechanism.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The nervous system and the endocrine glands considered as a functional unit.
