- the system of dual control of certain activities of the body by means of both nerves and circulating hormones. The functioning of the autonomic nervous system is particularly closely linked to that of the pituitary and adrenal glands. The system can give rise to neuroendocrine tumors (NETs), which have special structural features and often produce active hormones. See also NEUROHORMONE; NEUROSECRETION.
