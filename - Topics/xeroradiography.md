- $n$. a type of X-ray imaging in which a picture of the body is recorded on paper rather than on film. A plate of selenium, which rests on a thin layer of aluminium oxide, is charged uniformly by passing it in front of a scorotron. As X-ray photons impinge on this, charges diffuse out in proportion to the energy content of the X-ray. An imprint is formed by the charge distribution on the plate, which attracts toner particles and is transferred to reusable paper plates. Unlike conventional X-ray imaging, xeroradiography does not require photographic developers. The technique does, however, require more radiation exposure. It was widely used in mammography prior to the advent of digital mammography.
