- (1) (share warrant) A security that offers the owner the right to subscribe for the ordinary shares of a company at a fixed date, usually at a fixed price. Warrants are themselves bought and sold on stock exchanges and are equivalent to stock options. Subscription prices usually exceed the market price, as the purchase of a warrant is a gamble that a company will prosper. They have proved increasingly popular in recent years as a company can issue them without including them in the balance sheet. 
- (2) A document that serves as proof that goods have been deposited in a public warehouse. The document identifies specific goods and can be transferred by endorsement. Warrants are frequently used as security against a bank loan. Warehouse warrants for warehouses attached to a wharf are known as dock warrants or wharfinger's warrants.
