## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The point reached in a plant when the rate of photosynthesis is equal to the rate of respiration. This means that the carbon dioxide released from respiration is equivalent to that which is taken up during photosynthesis. The compensation point is reached as light intensity increases. If the light intensity is increased beyond the compensation point, the rate of photosynthesis increases proportionally until the point of light saturation is reached, beyond which the rate of photosynthesis is no longer affected by light intensity.
