- (SCP model) A commonly used paradigm in industrial organization economics. It states that the structure or form of a particular market (i.e. the level of concentration and presence or absence of barriers to entry) will determine the conduct (i.e. strategic behavior) of buyers and sellers and the overall performance (i.e. social efficiency) of that market. As the number of significant players within a market increases, the ability of firms to influence prices declines and the efficiency of the market is enhanced.
