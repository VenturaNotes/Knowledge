- (thyrocalcitonin) $n$. a hormone, produced by $\mathrm{C}$ cells in the thyroid gland, that lowers the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood. Medullary thyroid cancer can produce high levels of this hormone, enabling its use as a tumour marker. A recombinant form of salmon calcitonin, salcatonin, is given by injection or nasal spray to treat malignant hypercalcaemia and Paget's disease of the bone. Compare PARATHYROID HORMONE.
