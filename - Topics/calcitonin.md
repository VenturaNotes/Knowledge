- (thyrocalcitonin) $n$. a hormone, produced by $\mathrm{C}$ cells in the thyroid gland, that lowers the levels of calcium and phosphate in the blood. Medullary thyroid cancer can produce high levels of this hormone, enabling its use as a tumour marker. A recombinant form of salmon calcitonin, salcatonin, is given by injection or nasal spray to treat malignant hypercalcaemia and Paget's disease of the bone. Compare PARATHYROID HORMONE.
## Source[^2]
- (thyrocalcitonin) A peptide hormone in vertebrates that lowers the concentration of calcium (and phosphate) in the blood by inhibiting the action of osteoclasts, thereby suppressing the release of calcium from bone, and promoting excretion of calcium and phosphate by the kidneys. It operates in opposition to parathyroid hormone. Calcitonin is produced by the $\mathrm{C}$ cells, which in mammals are located in the thyroid gland. Its precise role in adult humans is unclear, because neither very low nor very high concentrations in the blood seem to have a deleterious effect.
