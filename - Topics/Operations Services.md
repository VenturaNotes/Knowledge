- Operations services handle the transfer of all or part of the day-to-day system management responsibility for a business's IT infrastructure. IT infrastructure includes a host (i.e., data center), client (i.e., desktop), and connectivity (i.e., network services and operations). Operations services might also transfer technology ownership or personnel to an outside vendor.
