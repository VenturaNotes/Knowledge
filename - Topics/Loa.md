- $n$. a genus of parasitic nematode worms (see FILARIA). The adult eye worm, L. loa, lives within the tissues beneath the skin, where it causes inflammation and swelling (see LOIASIS). The motile embryos, present in the blood during the day, may be taken up by bloodsucking Chrysops flies. Here they develop into infective larvae, ready for transmission to a new human host.
