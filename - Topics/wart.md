- $n$. a benign growth on the skin caused by infection with human papillomavirus (a few of the many serotypes are oncogenic). Common warts are firm horny papules, $1-10 \mathrm{~mm}$ in diameter, found mainly on the hands. Most will clear spontaneously within two years. Plantar warts (or verrucae) occur on the soles and are often tender. Plane warts are flat and skin-coloured - and therefore difficult to see; they are usually found on the face and may be present in very large numbers. Anogenital warts are frequently associated with other genital infections (see CONDYLOMA). Treatment of warts is with OTC (over-the-counter) remedies, such as lactic and salicylic acids; cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen is also effective. Curettage and cautery is very occasionally used, as well as immunotherapy with diphencyclopropenone.
