- dilated veins in the lower oesophagus due to portal hypertension. Varices have a high risk of bleeding, resulting in life-threatening haematemesis. Bleeding may be arrested by band ligation (or banding): an endoscopic technique in which rubber bands are applied to the base of a bleeding varix. Injection of sclerosants into bleeding varices is an older technique not now widely used. Failure to stop variceal bleeding at endoscopy may require the insertion of a Sengstaken-Blakemore tube (a compression balloon). Nonendoscopic treatments for variceal bleeding include antibiotics and vasoactive agents (such as terlipressin or octreotide).
