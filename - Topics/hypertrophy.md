- (hypertrophia) $n$. increase in the size of a tissue or organ brought about by the enlargement of its cells rather than by cell multiplication (as during normal growth and tumor formation). Hypertrophy can be a physiological response to normal stimuli, as in the enlargement of skeletal muscles in response to increased work. Pathological hypertrophy occurs in response to abnormal stimuli, as in cardiac muscle as a result of hypertension or aortic valve stenosis (see also HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY). Compare HYPERPLASIA. $\textendash$hypertrophic adj.
## Source[^2]
- An increase in the size of a tissue or organ due to an increase in the size of its component cells. Hypertrophy often occurs in response to an increased workload in an organ, which may result from malfunction or disease. Compare HYPERPLASIA.
