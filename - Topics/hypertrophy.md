- (hypertrophia) $n$. increase in the size of a tissue or organ brought about by the enlargement of its cells rather than by cell multiplication (as during normal growth and tumor formation). Hypertrophy can be a physiological response to normal stimuli, as in the enlargement of skeletal muscles in response to increased work. Pathological hypertrophy occurs in response to abnormal stimuli, as in cardiac muscle as a result of hypertension or aortic valve stenosis (see also HYPERTROPHIC CARDIOMYOPATHY). Compare HYPERPLASIA. $\textendash$hypertrophic adj.
