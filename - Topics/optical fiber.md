## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A thin transparent fibre used to carry optical signals, typically in the infrared with a wavelength of 1200-1550 nanometers. Optical fibers require special devices to convert electric signals to light energy at the transmitting end, and to convert light energy to electric signals at the receiving end. Equipment is also needed to handle whatever lower-level protocols are to be used across the optical fibre. A variety of methods are used to reduce the loss of the optical signal. See also FIBER OPTICS.
