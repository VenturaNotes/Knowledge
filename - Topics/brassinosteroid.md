- (brassin; BR) Any of a group of steroid derivatives that occur at very low concentrations in plant tissues and are potent plant hormones. Brassinosteroids have been found in pollen, leaves, stems, and flowers from various species; the most active form is brassinolide (BL). Extracts behave in a manner similar to auxins, for example stimulating elongation of hypocotyl and epicotyl tissue from seedlings when applied at concentrations as low as $10^{-12} \mathrm{M}$. Brassinosteroids have various physiological effects, such as promoting growth by stimulating cell elongation and cell division in shoots, and promoting seed germination and pollen tube elongation. They promote root growth at low concentrations but have an inhibitory effect at high concentrations. Brassinosteroids have been shown to act synergistically with auxins and additively with gibberellins. BL binds to a membrane receptor called BRI1, thereby triggering downstream signal responses and ultimately regulating gene expression.
