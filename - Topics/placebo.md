## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. a medicine that is ineffective but may help to relieve a condition because the patient has faith in its powers. New drugs are tested against placebos in clinical trials: the drug's effect is compared with the placebo response, which occurs even in the absence of any pharmacologically active substance in the placebo. Use of placebos in treatment is controversial, with some believing that such treatment compromises the patient's autonomy and compromises the virtue of honesty, thereby potentially undermining the doctor-patient relationship.
