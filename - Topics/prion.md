- $n$. an abnormal form of a constituent protein (PrP) of brain cells. The abnormal proteins are very stable: they are not removed by the normal cellular processes of degradation and are resistant to radiation and sterilization (therefore surgical instruments need first to undergo decontamination). They are believed to interact with normal PrP in such a way as to convert it to the abnormal form, which accumulates in the brain. Prions are now widely accepted as being the causal agents of a range of serious diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, and kuru, all of which are spongiform encephalopathies. Different mutations in the $\operatorname{PrP}$ gene are believed to be responsible for the different forms of these so-called prion disorders.
