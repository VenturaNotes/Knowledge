- $n$. an abnormal form of a constituent protein (PrP) of brain cells. The abnormal proteins are very stable: they are not removed by the normal cellular processes of degradation and are resistant to radiation and sterilization (therefore surgical instruments need first to undergo decontamination). They are believed to interact with normal PrP in such a way as to convert it to the abnormal form, which accumulates in the brain. Prions are now widely accepted as being the causal agents of a range of serious diseases including Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, Gerstmann-Straussler-Scheinker syndrome, and kuru, all of which are spongiform encephalopathies. Different mutations in the $\operatorname{PrP}$ gene are believed to be responsible for the different forms of these so-called prion disorders.

- An abnormal form of a normal cell protein (PrP) found in the brain of mammals that is the agent responsible for the diseases scrapie in sheep, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) in cattle, and Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans. Produced by mutation of the normal PrP gene, the abnormal prion protein induces the normal protein to fold incorrectly, causing it to form aggregates. These accumulate in the brain and progressively damage and destroy brain cells. Prion protein can be transmitted to other individuals of the same or closely related species, by injection or ingestion of infected tissue, and is transmissible between species that are not closely related, e.g. between cattle and humans.
