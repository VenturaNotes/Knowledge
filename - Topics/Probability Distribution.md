## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- A probability distribution is a [[statistical function]] that describes all the possible values and likelihoods that a random variable can take within a given range. 

## Source[^2]
- A probability distribution describes how the probabilities of different outcomes are assigned to the possible values of a random variable. It provides a way of modeling the likelihood of each outcome in a [[random experiment]]

## Source[^3]
- Theoretical formulas for the probability that an observation has a particular value, or lies within a given range of values.
- Discrete probability distributions apply to observations that can take only certain distinct values, such as the integers 0, 1, 2,... or the six named faces of a die. A probability, $p(r)$, is assigned to each event such that the total is unity. Important discrete distributions are the binomial distribution and the Poisson distribution
- Continuous probability distributions apply to observations, such as physical measurements, where no two observations are likely to be exactly the same. Since the probability of observing exactly a given value is about zero, a mathematical function, the [[cumulative distribution function]], $F(x)$, is used instead. This is defined as the probability that the observation does not exceed x. F(x) increases monotonically with $x$ from 0 to 1, and the probability of observing any value between two limits, $x_1$ and $x_2$, is $$F(x_2)-F(x_1)$$This definition leads, by differential calculus, to the frequency function, f(x), which is the limiting ratio of $$F(x+h)-F(x) \text{ to } h$$as $h$ becomes small, so that the probability of an observation between $x$ and $(x+h)$ is $h.f(x).$ The most important continuous distribution is the normal (or Gaussian) distribution
- Probability distributions are defined in terms of parameters, whose values determine the numerical values of the probabilities
