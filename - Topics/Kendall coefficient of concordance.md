- $n$. In statistics, an index of the degree of agreement between several variables measured on an ordinal scale or transformed to ranks, ranging from 0 (no agreement) to 1 (complete agreement). It may be thought of as similar to Kendall's tau but suitable for measuring the association between more than two variables at a time. Symbol: W. See also kappa statistic. \[Named after the English statistician Maurice George Kendall (1907-83) who introduced it in 1948]
