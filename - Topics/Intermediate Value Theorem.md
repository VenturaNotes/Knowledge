- The theorem states that if a real function $f$ is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and $\eta$ is a real number between $f(a)$ and $f(b)$, then $f(c) = \eta$ for some $c$ in $(a,b)$.
- The theorem relies on the connectedness of the interval and naturally generalizes to real-valued functions on other connected spaces
