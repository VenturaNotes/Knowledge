- a method of rapidly assessing the general state of a baby immediately after birth. A score of 0,1 , or 2 points is given for each sign, usually measured at one minute and five minutes after delivery (see table). Thus an infant scoring a total of 10 points would be in optimum condition. When the score is low, the test is repeated at intervals as a guide to short-term progress. \[V. Apgar (1909-74), US anaesthetist]

## Source[^2]
- $n$. An index of the physical and psychological condition of a newborn infant obtained by adding points (0, 1, or 2 ) for heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, response to stimulation, and skin coloration, a score of 10 representing perfect condition on the test. \[Named after the US anaesthesiologist Virginia Apgar (1909-74) who introduced it in an article in the journal Current Research in Anesthesia and Analgesia in 1953, notwithstanding a popular folk etymology in medical circles according to which it is an abbreviation for 'activity, pulse, grimace, appearance, and respiration']
