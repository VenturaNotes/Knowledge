- a method of rapidly assessing the general state of a baby immediately after birth. A score of 0,1 , or 2 points is given for each sign, usually measured at one minute and five minutes after delivery (see table). Thus an infant scoring a total of 10 points would be in optimum condition. When the score is low, the test is repeated at intervals as a guide to short-term progress. \[V. Apgar (1909-74), US anaesthetist]
