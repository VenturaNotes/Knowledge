## Source [^1]
- IPv6 is the next generation of Internet Protocol (IP), which provides a vast, engineered improvement over its predecessor IPv4. The main benefits of IPv6 are vastly increased address space, integrated security and quality-of-service mechanisms, as well as support for automatic configuration and mobility. A larger addressing space makes it easier to assign IP addresses to networked devices. Another plus of IPv6 is the simplified way in which it allows for hierarchical address allocation.
