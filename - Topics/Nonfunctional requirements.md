## Synthesis
- Describes how well a system performs its functions, rather than what it does. 
	- Quality, constraints, and characteristics of the system
- Example: Website shall load within 3 seconds for 90% of users
	- It doesn't describe a specific action the user can take (which is [[functional requirements]]), but rather a performance standard for the entire system.
