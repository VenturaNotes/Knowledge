- $n$. a hollow tube designed for insertion into a body cavity, such as the bladder, or a blood vessel. The tube contains a sharp pointed solid core (trocar), which facilitates its insertion and is withdrawn when the cannula is in place. This allows aspiration of contents or infiltration of substances, such as medication.
