- The replication of chromosomes in the absence of cell or nuclear division, resulting in numerous copies within each cell. It occurs notably in the salivary glands of Drosophila and other flies. Cells in these tissues contain giant chromosomes (see POLYTENY), each consisting of over a thousand intimately associated, or synapsed, chromatids.
