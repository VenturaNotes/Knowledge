- $n$. A unit of subjective pitch, arbitrarily anchored so that a 1,000-hertz tone at 40 decibels has a value of 1,000 mels by definition, other values being determined by fractionation, the resulting graph of pitch in mels as a function of frequency in hertz usually being approximately S-shaped. \[From Greek melos a song]
