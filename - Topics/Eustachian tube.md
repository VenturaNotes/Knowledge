- the tube that connects the middle ear to the pharynx. It allows the pressure on the inner side of the eardrum to remain equal to the external pressure. \[B. Eustachio (1520-74), Italian anatomist]
## Source[^2]
- The tube that connects the middle ear to the back of the throat (pharynx) in vertebrates. It is normally closed, but during swallowing it opens to allow air into the middle ear, which equalizes the pressure on each side of the tympanum (eardrum). It was named after the Italian anatomist Bartolomeo Eustachio (?1520-74).
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A passageway lined with a mucous membrane that joins the pharynx and the middle ear cavity, allowing equalization of the air pressure in the middle ear when atmospheric pressure changes, as when traveling by aircraft. Also (non-technically) called an auditory tube. Compare AUDITORY CANAL. \[Named after the Italian physician Bartolomeo Eustachio (1520-74) who was the first to describe it in his De Auditu Organis in 1562]
