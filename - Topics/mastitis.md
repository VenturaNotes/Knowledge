- $n$. inflammation of the breast, usually caused by bacterial infection via damaged nipples. It most often occurs as acute puerperal mastitis, which develops during the period of breast-feeding, about a month after childbirth, and sometimes involves the discharge of pus. Chronic cystic mastitis has a different cause and does not involve inflammation. The breast feels lumpy due to the presence of cysts, and the condition is thought to be caused by hormone imbalance.
