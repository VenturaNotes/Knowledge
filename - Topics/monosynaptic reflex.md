- A simple reflex that involves transmission of information from a sensory neuron to the appropriate motor neuron across a single synapse in the spinal cord. The knee-jerk reflex action is an example of a monosynaptic reflex (see STRETCH REFLEX). Compare POLYSYNAPTIC REFLEX.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. A reflex involving just one synapse (1) between a sensory neuron and a motor neuron, without the involvement of any interneurons. Stretch reflexes are the only monosynaptic reflexes in humans. Strictly speaking the term is a misnomer and is avoided in careful usage, because there must also be a synapse between the motor neuron and the muscle, hence any reflex necessarily involves at least two synapses. Also called a single-synapse reflex. Compare polysynaptic reflex. \[From Greek monos single + syn together + haptein to fasten]
