- $n$. a malignant tumor of connective tissue, derived from fibroblasts. Fibrosarcomas may arise in soft tissue or bone; they can affect any organ but are most common in the limbs, particularly the leg. They occur in people of all ages and may be congenital. The cells of these tumors show varying degrees of differentiation; the less well differentiated tumors containing elements of histiocytes have been recently reclassified as malignant fibrous histiocytomas.
