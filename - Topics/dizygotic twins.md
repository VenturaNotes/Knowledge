- $n$. Twins that are dizygotic, arising from the fertilization of two separate ova or eggs by two separate spermatozoa at about the same time, leading to the development of individuals usually (if they have the same father) sharing about half their genes in common like ordinary siblings. Their relative frequency is affected by many environmental factors and is greatly increased by the use of fertility drugs. Also called fraternal twins or non-identical twins. See also twin study. Compare monozygotic twins. DZ twins abbrev.
