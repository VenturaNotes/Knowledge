- In telecommunications, a continuity check is a test performed to verify that a path exists before starting speech or data transmissions. Continuity refers to the pathâ€™s existence. If continuity doesn't exist, then either the transmission is aborted or the sender attempts to reestablish communication. Continuity checks are used in channel-associated signaling (CAS), where signals are sent over the same channel used for data transmission. Continuity checks aren't present by default in common-channel signaling (CCS), an alternative to CAS where signals are sent via a different channel than the one used for data transmission, but can be implemented if desired.
