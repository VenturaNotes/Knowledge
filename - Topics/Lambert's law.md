- The law stating that diffusely reflected and transmitted light is scattered in all radiated directions with equal intensity and that this intensity is proportional to three values: the intensity of the incident light, the reflectance of the surface, and the cosine of the angle between the surface normal and the direction of the incident light. In computer graphics the law is particularly useful for diffuse surfaces such as chalk.
