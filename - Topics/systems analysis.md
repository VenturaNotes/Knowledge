## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- The analysis of the role of a proposed system and the identification of a set of requirements that the system should meet, and thus the starting point for system design. The term is most commonly used in the context of commercial programming, where those involved in software development are often classed as either systems analysts or programmers. The systems analysts are responsible for identifying a set of requirements (i.e. systems analysis) and producing a design. The design is then passed to the programmers, who are responsible for actual implementation of the system.
## Source[^2]
- The examination or analysis of the objectives and problems of a system for the purpose of developing and improving the system by the use of computers. Systems analysis entails producing a precise statement of what is to be accomplished, determining the methods of achieving the objectives that are most cost-effective, and preparing a feasibility study. If the study is accepted by the customer, the systems analysts will advise on the hardware and software needed, provide programmers with the details they need to write the programs, produce documentation describing the system, plan staff training on it, and monitor the system once it is installed.
