## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- The analysis of the role of a proposed system and the identification of a set of requirements that the system should meet, and thus the starting point for system design. The term is most commonly used in the context of commercial programming, where those involved in software development are often classed as either systems analysts or programmers. The systems analysts are responsible for identifying a set of requirements (i.e. systems analysis) and producing a design. The design is then passed to the programmers, who are responsible for actual implementation of the system.
