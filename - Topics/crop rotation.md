## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An agricultural practice in which different crops are cultivated in succession on the same area of land over a period of time so as to maintain soil fertility and reduce the adverse effects of pests. Legumes are important in the rotation as they are a source of nitrogen for the soil (see NITROGEN FIXATION; ROOT NODULE). In the UK, other crops that may be included in a typical four-stage rotation are wheat, barley, and root crops. However, the use of pesticides enables the monoculture of crops in modern farming systems (see AGRICULTURE).
