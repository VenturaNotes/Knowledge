- A theorem concerning the existence and nature of fixed points used to give solutions to equations. A fixed point of a function $f$$$f: X \rightarrow X$$is an element $x$ such that $f(x)=x$. A [[least fixed point]] is one that, among all the fixed points of $f$, is lowest in some partial ordering that has been imposed on the elements of $X$. Specifically, if $\leq$ is a partial ordering of $X$ then $x$ is a least fixed point if for fixed point $y$ we have $x \leq y$.
- The most often-cited form of fixed-point theorem to do with computing is due originally to S. C. Kleene, and originated in recursive function theory. It states that, subject to certain assumptions, notably that $f$ is continuous, $f$ has a least fixed point, $x_{f}$, which moreover can be characterized as the limit of a sequence $x_{0}, x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots$ of approximations. This abstract fact is of great relevance to the semantics of programming languages, in particular in specifying the precise meaning of constructs like iteration, recursion, and recursive types using equations.
