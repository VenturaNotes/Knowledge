## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (recombinant DNA technology) the techniques involved in altering the characteristics of an organism by inserting genes from another organism into its DNA. This altered DNA (known as recombinant DNA) is usually produced by isolating foreign genes, often by the use of restriction enzymes, and inserting them into bacterial DNA, often using viruses as vectors. Once inserted, the foreign gene may use the cell machinery of its host to synthesize the protein that it originally coded for in the organism it was derived from. For example, the human genes for insulin, interferon, and growth hormone production have been incorporated into bacterial DNA and such genetically engineered bacteria are used in the commercial production of these substances. Some other applications of genetic engineering include DNA analysis, the production of monoclonal antibodies, and $\textendash$ more recently $\textendash$ gene therapy.
