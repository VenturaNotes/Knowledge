- (EFTA) A trade association formed in 1960 between Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Finland, Iceland, and Liechtenstein joined later while the UK, Denmark, Portugal, Austria, Finland, and Sweden left on joining the European Union (or its earlier forms). EFTA is a looser association than the EU, dealing only with trade barriers rather than generally coordinating economic policy. All tariffs between EFTA and EU countries were abolished finally in 1984. EFTA is governed by a council in which each member has one vote; decisions must normally be unanimous and are binding on all member countries. In 1992 the European Economic Area (EEA) was formed to facilitate the movement of goods, services, capital, and labour between all EU and EFTA countries with the exception of Switzerland.

- (EFTA) An association of European countries with free trade between them, established in 1959. The original members were Austria, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Switzerland, and the UK. Finland and Iceland joined later; Denmark and the UK left when they joined the European Economic Community in 1973, as did Portugal in 1986 and Austria, Finland, and Sweden in 1995. The only remaining members of EFTA are Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Finland. EFTA is a free-trade area and not a customs union, and the freetrade provisions are restricted to goods originating in member countries. EFTA has an industrial free-trade agreement with the European Union.
