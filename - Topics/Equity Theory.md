- Equity theory is the term used to describe the call for a fair balance between an employee's input and output. In other words, an employee's hard work, skill level, and overall contribution to the SMB should be reflected in their salary, benefits, and appreciation within the company. According to the equity theory, reaching this balance guarantees a strong and effective relationship between employee and employer and helps keep employee morale high.
