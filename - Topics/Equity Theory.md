- Equity theory is the term used to describe the call for a fair balance between an employee's input and output. In other words, an employee's hard work, skill level, and overall contribution to the SMB should be reflected in their salary, benefits, and appreciation within the company. According to the equity theory, reaching this balance guarantees a strong and effective relationship between employee and employer and helps keep employee morale high.

- A cognitive theory of motivation, based on the work of J. Stacey Adams, which claims that employees will be motivated if they believe that they are fairly treated in the workplace. The theory proposes that employees form an estimate of how the total benefits they receive from a job (pay, status, interest) compare with their total input (effort, skill, experience); this ratio is then compared with that of other people doing similar work. If the latter comparison is unfavourable, motivation will suffer.
