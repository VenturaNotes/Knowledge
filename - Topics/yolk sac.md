- (vitelline sac) the membranous sac, composed of mesoderm lined with endoderm, that lies ventral to the embryo. It is one of the extraembryonic membranes. Its initially wide communication with the future gut is later reduced to a narrow duct passing through the umbilicus. It probably assists in transporting nutrients to the early embryo and is one of the first sites where blood cells are formed.

- One of the protective membranes surrounding the embryos of birds, reptiles, and mammals (see EXTRAEMBRYONIC MEMBRANES). The embryo derives nourishment from the yolk sac via a system of blood vessels. In birds and reptiles the yolk sac encloses the yolk; in most mammals a fluid replaces the yolk.
