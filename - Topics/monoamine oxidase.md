- (MAO) an enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of a large variety of monoamines, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, and serotonin. Monoamine oxidase is found in most tissues, particularly the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system, and exists in two forms in humans: monoamine oxidase A primarily breaks down noradrenaline and serotonin, whereas monoamine oxidase B primarily degrades dopamine. Drugs that act as inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A may be used in the treatment of depression (see MAO inhibitor); monoamine oxidase B inhibitors are used to treat Parkinson's disease.
