- (MAO) an enzyme that catalyses the oxidation of a large variety of monoamines, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, and serotonin. Monoamine oxidase is found in most tissues, particularly the gastrointestinal tract and nervous system, and exists in two forms in humans: monoamine oxidase A primarily breaks down noradrenaline and serotonin, whereas monoamine oxidase B primarily degrades dopamine. Drugs that act as inhibitors of monoamine oxidase A may be used in the treatment of depression (see MAO inhibitor); monoamine oxidase B inhibitors are used to treat Parkinson's disease.

- (MAO) An enzyme that breaks down monoamines (e.g. adrenaline and noradrenaline) in the body by oxidation. Drugs that inhibit this enzyme are used to treat forms of depression.

- $n$. An enzyme that is located between the outer and inner membranes of mitochondria in almost all tissues and that metabolizes monoamines, notably catecholamines, within neurons. See also monoamine oxidase inhibitor. Compare Catechol-o-Methyltransferase (COMT). MAO abbrev. \[From Greek monos single or alone + English amine + oxid(ation) + Greek -ase denoting an enzyme, from diastasis separation]
