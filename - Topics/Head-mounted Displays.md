- Head-mounted displays, sometimes shortened to HMDs, are small screens or projections that are integrated into eyeglasses or mounted on a helmet or hat. The display streams data, images, videos, and other important info into the user's field of vision. This can include heads-up displays, which places an image inline with a user's view of the real world, and retinal display, which places a projected image directly onto a user's eye so the user feel like they're looking at a screen.
