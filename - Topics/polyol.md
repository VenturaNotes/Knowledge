The term is usually restricted to the sugar alcohols, which include such biologically important molecules as myo-inositol glycerol, sorbitol (common in the fruits of many plants), and ribitol (found in bacterial cell walls). Certain polyols act as osmolytes in the kidney cells or function as antifreeze molecules.
