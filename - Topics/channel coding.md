- The use of error-detecting or error-correcting codes in order to achieve reliable communication through a transmission channel. In channel coding, the particular code to be used is chosen to match the channel (and especially its noise characteristics), rather than the source of the information. See CHANNEL CODING THEOREM, Shannon's MODEL. Compare SOURCE CODING.
