- A search of a directed graph, and hence of a tree, conducted as follows. An initial starting vertex $u$ is selected and visited. Then a (directed) edge $(u, v)$ incident upon $u$ is selected and a visit is made to $v$. Let $x$ be the most recent vertex visited. Select some unexplored edge $(x, y)$ incident upon $x$. If $y$ has not been previously visited, visit $y$ and proceed from there. If $y$ has been previously visited select another edge incident upon $x$. Having completed the search through all paths beginning at $y$, return to $x$ and continue to explore the edges incident upon $x$.
- Depth-first searches of graphs play an important part in the design of efficient algorithms on graphs, in game theory, heuristic programming, and in artificial intelligence. See also ITERATIVE DEEPENING.
