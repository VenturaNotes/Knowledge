## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- An approach to controlling the performance of an operating system that attempts to forecast a future state and to take the necessary action before problems arise. For example, in a statistical process control system the operation may remain in control, but knowledge of the system enables the operator to extrapolate trends in control data and to take the action necessary to avoid the system becoming out of control. The success of this approach is dependent on the ability to predict the consequences of a particular event. Compare CONCURRENT CONTROL; FEEDBACK CONTROL.
