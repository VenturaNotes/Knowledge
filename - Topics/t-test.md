- In a linear regression, a test of a simple linear hypothesis $H_{0}$ : $f\left(\theta_{1}, \ldots, \theta_{K}\right)=0$ against the alternative $H_{1}: f\left(\theta_{1}, \ldots, \theta_{K}\right) \neq 0$ (two-tailed test) or $H_{1}: f\left(\theta_{1}, \ldots, \theta_{K}\right)<0$ (one-tailed test), where $\theta$ is a $(K \times 1)$ vector of regression parameters and $f(\cdot)$ is a scalar linear function. Under the null hypothesis, assuming normally distributed random errors, the test statistic, $t=f(\theta) /$ s.e. $(f(\theta))$, has Student's t-distribution with $(N-K)$ degrees of freedom. Here $\theta$ is the ordinary least squares estimator of $\theta$ and s.e. is the standard error.
