- nephritis associated with infected indwelling shunts. The infection is usually with staphylococci (S. epidermidis) and patients present with anorexia, malaise, arthralgia, and low-grade fever. Purpura, anaemia, and hepatosplenomegaly may be found and urine analysis shows heavy proteinuria, often with a nephrotic syndrome and haematuria. Treatment usually involves removal of the infected shunt as well as antibiotics.
