- A grammar in which each production has one of the forms$$\begin{aligned}& A \rightarrow b \\& A \rightarrow b C\end{aligned}$$where $b$ is a terminal and $A, C$ are nonterminals. Like the right-linear and left-linear grammars (see LINEAR GRAMMAR) regular grammars generate precisely the regular languages.
