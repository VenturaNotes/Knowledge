- (GPI, general paresis) a stage of tertiary syphilis characterized by dementia and spastic weakness of the limbs (paresis). Deafness, epilepsy, and dysarthria may occur. The infecting organism can be detected in the brain cells and tests for syphilis in blood and cerebrospinal fluid are usually positive. When the symptoms are combined with those of tabes dorsalis, the resulting condition is called tabo-paresis. The condition is now rare due to widespread treatment of earlier stages with penicillin and other antibiotics.
