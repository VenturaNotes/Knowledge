- A subgroup of the group that is formed from the set, $S_{n}$, of all permutations of $n$ distinct elements and on which is defined the dyadic operation of composition of functions. The full group $S_{n}$ is usually called the symmetric group and possesses $n!$  elements. Every finite group is isomorphic to some permutation group.
