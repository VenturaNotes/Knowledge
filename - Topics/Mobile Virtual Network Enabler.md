- A Mobile Virtual Network Enabler (MVNE) is a company that provides network infrastructure and related services, such as business support systems, administration, and operations support systems to a mobile virtual network operator (MVNO). This enables MVNOs to offer services to their own customers with their own brands. The MVNE does not have a relationship with consumers, but rather is a provider of network enablement platforms and services. Mobile virtual network enablers (MVNEs) specialize in planning, implementation, and management of mobile services. MVNEs typically provide a range of services that include SIM provisioning and configuration, and customer billing.
