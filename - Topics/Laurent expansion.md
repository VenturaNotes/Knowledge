- For a function $f(z)$ which is holomorphic within the annulus centered at $a$ in the complex plane, defined by $r_1 \lt |z-a| \lt r_2$ the Laurent expansion is $$f(z) = \sum_{k=-\infty}^\infty c_k(z-a)^k$$where $$c_k = \int_C\frac{f(w)}{(w-a)^{k+1}}dw$$with the path integral being around C, the positively oriented circle $|z-a| = r$ where $r_1 \lt r \lt r_2$. Compare Taylor's THEOREM; see ISOLATED SINGULARITY.
