- Assets turned over frequently in the course of business. These include cash, debtors (other than bad debts), and stocks. Current assets are contrasted with fixed assets, which last some years and are depreciated.
## Source[^2]
- (circulating assets; circulating capital; floating assets) Those assets of an organization that form part of the working capital and are constantly changing their form, circulating from cash to goods and back to cash again. Cash is used to purchase raw materials, which become work in progress when issued to a production department. The work in progress becomes finished goods, which once they are sold, become debtors or cash from an accounting point of view. Debtors are ultimately changed into cash when they pay, thus completing the cycle. Compare FIXED ASSET.
