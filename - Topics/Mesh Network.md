- Mesh networks, or meshnets, are a form of network connectivity where a main router connects to a modem and then other nodes connect to this router. While it sounds similar to Wi-Fi, the critical difference is that all of these nodes share the same SSID and password. With Wi-Fi routers, each has its own SSID and password. Mesh networks are used to improve connectivity in areas where connections may be spotty or otherwise ineffective.
