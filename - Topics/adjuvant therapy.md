- treatment given to patients after the primary therapy, which is usually surgical removal of the tumor, when there is a high risk of future recurrence based on tumor stage and histology. Adjuvant therapy is aimed at destroying these microscopic tumor cells either locally (e.g. adjuvant breast irradiation after breast-conserving surgery) or systemically (e.g. adjuvant chemotherapy may be recommended for patients with breast cancer, colorectal cancer, and other types of cancer). Compare NEOADJUVANT CHEMOTHERAPY.
