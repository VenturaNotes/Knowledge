- the inhibition of thyroid hormone production by administration of large doses of iodide. This occurs at a critical dosage level below which the addition of iodide to an iodine-deficient individual results in increased production of thyroid hormone. The effect is transient in individuals with normal thyroids but may persist in thyroiditis; it can be utilized medically to induce a hypothyroid state, for example in patients with thyroid crisis (see Lugol's SOLUTION). \[L. Wolff (1898-1972), US cardiologist; I. L. Chaikoff (20th century), US physiologist]
