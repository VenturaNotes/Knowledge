- The ability of a product to perform its advertised functions, in the mind of the consumer. A product's quality includes its durability, reliability, precision, ease of operation, and its ability to be repaired if it goes wrong. Some of these quality attributes can be measured objectively, while others can only be assessed in terms of consumers' perceptions. It is important that companies should achieve consistency of quality. See TOTAL QUALITY MANAGEMENT.
