- A fundamental concept in mathematics. Let$$x_{1}, x_{2}, \ldots, x_{n}$$be $m$-component vectors. These vectors are linearly independent if for some scalars $\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}$, $\ldots, \alpha_{n}$,$$\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_{i} x_{i}=0$$implies$$\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}=\ldots=\alpha_{n}=0$$Otherwise the vectors are said to be [[linearly dependent]], i.e. at least one of the vectors can be written as a linear combination of the others. The importance of a linearly independent set of vectors is that, providing there are enough of them, any arbitrary vector can be represented uniquely in terms of them.
- A similar concept applies to functions $f_{1}(x), f_{2}(x), \ldots, f_{n}(x)$ defined on an interval $[a, b]$, which are linearly independent if for some scalars $\alpha_{1}, \alpha_{2}, \ldots, \alpha_{n}$, the condition,$$\begin{align}&\sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_{i} f_{i}(x)=0 \\ &\text{for all } x \text{ in} [a,b],\end{align}$$implies$$\alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}=\ldots=\alpha_{n}=0$$
