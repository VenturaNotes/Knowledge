- An approach to job design that reduces boredom, and thus increases motivation, by rotating staff through a range of jobs. This process can also increase the flexibility of a system by introducing an element of multiskilling. The key is to make use of rotation with a minimum of disruption and learning-curve effects, and to retain the element of freshness.
