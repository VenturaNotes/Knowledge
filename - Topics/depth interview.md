## Source [^1]
- An unstructured interview that explores a marketing issue for purposes of marketing research. The interviewer, a specialist acting on behalf of a client, will have previously compiled a topic guide that identifies the points to be explored; the respondent is part of a sample chosen to match certain criteria (e.g. if the problem concerned tea all respondents would be tea drinkers). The interview is conducted informally and the interviewer adopts a passive role; he encourages the respondent to talk and ask questions, while ensuring that all the points on the topic guide are covered. After a minimum of ten such interviews, the interviewer reports back to his client with his marketing recommendations. Depth interviews are a qualitative procedure (see QUALITATIVE MARKETING RESEARCH).
