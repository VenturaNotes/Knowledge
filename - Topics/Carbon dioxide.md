- a colorless gas formed in the tissues during metabolism and carried in the blood to the lungs, where it is exhaled (an increase in the concentration of this gas in the blood stimulates respiration). Carbon dioxide occurs in small amounts in the atmosphere; it is used by plants in the process of photosynthesis. It forms a solid (dry ice) at $-75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (at atmospheric pressure) and in this form is used as a refrigerant. Formula: $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.
