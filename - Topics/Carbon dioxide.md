- a colorless gas formed in the tissues during metabolism and carried in the blood to the lungs, where it is exhaled (an increase in the concentration of this gas in the blood stimulates respiration). Carbon dioxide occurs in small amounts in the atmosphere; it is used by plants in the process of photosynthesis. It forms a solid (dry ice) at $-75^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ (at atmospheric pressure) and in this form is used as a refrigerant. Formula: $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$.

- A colorless odorless gas, $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$, which dissolves in water to give carbonic acid. It occurs in the atmosphere ($0.04 \%$ by volume) but has a short residence time in this phase as it is both consumed by plants during photosynthesis and produced by respiration, fermentation, and combustion.
- The level of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by some $40 \%$ since the Industrial Revolution, mainly because of extensive burning of fossil fuels and the destruction of large areas of rainforest. This has been postulated as the main cause of the average increase of about $0.94^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ in global temperatures over the last 130 years, through the greenhouse effect. Atmospheric $\mathrm{CO}_{2}$ concentration, currently nearly 410 ppm, continues to rise in spite of some steps to control emissions, giving the prospect of accelerated global warming and more dramatic climate change in the foreseeable future.
