- (EGFR) a protein on the surface of cells (see RECEPTOR) that binds with epidermal growth factor and is therefore involved in cell division. EGFR is expressed at increased levels in numerous tumours, particularly of the head and neck, and in colorectal cancer, in which it can be a target for antibody therapy with cetuximab. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors acting specifically on the EGFR include gefitinib and erlotinib in lung and pancreatic cancer.
