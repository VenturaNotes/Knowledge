- A method of terminating a series of transmissions relating to a single complete transaction using control characters. The sending device transmits an 'ETX' (end-of-text) control character when a transaction is completed, and the receiving device acknowledges the satisfactory receipt of the ETX with an 'ACK' (see ACKNOWLEDGMENT). Termination of transmissions in this way should not be confused with the flow control necessary to regulate traffic during the transmission process.
