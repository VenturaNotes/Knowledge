- (1) Formerly the tax allowance associated with the dividend paid by a company. The shareholder was given allowance for the tax paid at source by the tax credit, at the same rate, 10/90; i.e. a dividend of $£ 90$ received by the shareholder has an associated tax credit of $£ 10$. For those paying the basic rate of income tax there was no further tax to pay. For those paying the higher rate income tax, income from dividends was charged at a rate of $32.5 \%$; for those paying the additional rate, the tax was $37.5 \%$. From April 2016 the tax credit system was replaced by a dividend tax. 
- (2) Any other allowance against a tax liability. 
- (3) In the UK, a social security payment such as the Working Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit that is administered by HM Revenue and Customs. Despite their titles, neither of these payments affects the amount of tax that is payable. Both these credits are due to be replaced by the new Universal Credit.

- A payment from the government to an individual or a family. The payment of a tax credit is conditional on certain characteristics. The UK government currently offers a Child Tax Credit, which is payable to any person over 16 below a certain income level with at least one child and the primary care responsibility for that child, and the Working Tax Credit, which is paid to anyone below a certain income level working over 16 hours per week. The level of payment for both of these credits is contingent upon income.
