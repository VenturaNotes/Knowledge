- The Dirac delta function $\delta (x)$ has defining properties $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\delta(x)dx = 1$ and $\delta(x) = 0$ for $x \ne 0$. No function, in the traditional sense, has these properties, but $\delta (x)$ can be rigorously understood as the Schwartz distribution $\delta (\varphi) = \varphi (0)$, where $\varphi$ is a test function. The delta function is useful for modeling point masses or charges, or instantaneous impulses. As a distribution it is the derivative of the Heaviside function. See SIFTING PROPERTY
