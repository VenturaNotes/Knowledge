- The process in which a mixture of liquids or solids forming a single thermodynamic phase is separated into two coexisting phases. Spinodal decomposition has been analyzed theoretically using models to describe diffusion, with considerable success. Spinodal decomposition is observed in the quenching of binary mixtures. See also spinodal curve.
