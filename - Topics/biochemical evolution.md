- (molecular evolution) The changes that occur at the molecular level in organisms over a period of time, particularly in the molecular constitution of the genome. These range from deletions, additions, or substitutions of single nucleotides, through the rearrangement of parts of genes, to the duplication of entire genes or even whole genomes. Such mutations may result in functional changes to the proteins encoded by the genes, or even the evolution of novel genes and proteins. See also MOLECULAR CLOCK.
