- (EMV) In decision making, the sum of the products of the outcomes in monetary terms and the probabilities of these outcomes arising. In decision trees subjective probability estimates are assigned to each possible outcome. In the EMV, the outcomes are expressed in terms of money. In the example given in the table, the EMV is 3900.
