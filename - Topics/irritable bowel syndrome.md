- (IBS) a common functional bowel disorder characterized by recurrent abdominal pain, altered stool consistency, and variable frequency of defecation. The symptoms, which may differ from individual to individual, may be caused by abnormal contractions of the colon, heightened sensitivity to such stimuli as stretching or distension, stress, and changes in diet. A minority of people may develop symptoms following an episode of gastroenteritis (postinfectious irritable bowel syndrome). Tests may be needed to rule out organic disease. Treatment includes reassurance, dietary manipulation (see FODMAPS), the use of antispasmodics, antidiarrhoeal drugs or laxatives, and drugs that reduce the sensitivity of the bowel (such as low-dose amitriptyline).
