- $n$. a unit of length equal to one ten millionth of a millimetre $\left(10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}\right)$. It is not a recommended SI unit but is sometimes used to express wavelengths and interatomic distances: the nanometre ( $1 \mathrm{~nm}=10$ $\mathring{A}$ ) is now the preferred unit. Symbol $\mathring{A}$.
## Source[^2]
- Symbol $\mathring{A}$. A unit of length equal to $10^{-10}$ metre. It was formerly used to measure wavelengths and intermolecular distances but has now been replaced by the nanometre. $1 ~\mathring{A}=0.1$ nanometre. The unit is named after the Swedish pioneer of spectroscopy A. J. Ångstrom (1814-74).
## Source[^3]
- $n$. One ten billionth of a metre ( $10^{-10}$ metre) or one ten millionth of a millimetre, used mainly for expressing wavelengths of light and other electromagnetic radiation. The visible spectrum extends from approximately 3,900 angstroms at the violet end of the spectrum to 7,400 angstroms at the red end. Also called an angstrom unit, but that usage is obsolescent. Also written Ångström, Ångström unit. Compare nanometre. \[Named after the Swedish physicist Anders Jonas Ångström (1814-74) who introduced it]
