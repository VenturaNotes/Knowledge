- $n$. a unit of length equal to one ten millionth of a millimetre $\left(10^{-10} \mathrm{~m}\right)$. It is not a recommended SI unit but is sometimes used to express wavelengths and interatomic distances: the nanometre ( $1 \mathrm{~nm}=10$ $\mathring{A}$ ) is now the preferred unit. Symbol $\mathring{A}$.
## Source[^2]
- Symbol $\mathring{A}$. A unit of length equal to $10^{-10}$ metre. It was formerly used to measure wavelengths and intermolecular distances but has now been replaced by the nanometre. $1 ~\mathring{A}=0.1$ nanometre. The unit is named after the Swedish pioneer of spectroscopy A. J. Ã…ngstrom (1814-74).
