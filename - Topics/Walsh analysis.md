- One of the many forms of orthogonal analysis (especially of signals); it employs the Walsh functions as its orthonormal basis. Walsh analysis is especially suited to digital signal processing since the Walsh functions themselves, and the operations based upon them, are easily represented and rapidly carried out by simple digital systems. The analysis of a signal in terms of Walsh functions is called its [[Walsh transform]]. See also DISCRETE AND CONTINUOUS SYSTEMS, FILTERING, SEQUENCY, BANDWIDTH.
