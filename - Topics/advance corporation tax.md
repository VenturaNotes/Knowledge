- The system by which UK companies deducted income tax at source when distributing dividends to their shareholders. With a tax rate of $100t$ per cent, companies paid the Inland Revenue $\textsterling t / (1-t)$ for every $\textsterling 1$ distributed to shareholders. These payments were treated as a payment on account of the company's own corporation tax. ACT was abolished in 1999.
