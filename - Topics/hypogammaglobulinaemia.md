- $n$. a deficiency of the protein gammaglobulin in the blood. It may occur in a variety of inherited disorders or as an acquired defect, as in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Since gammaglobulin consists mainly of antibodies (immunoglobulins), hypogammaglobulinaemia results in an increased susceptibility to infections.
