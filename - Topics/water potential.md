## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A [[solution (Chemistry)|solution]] that has a relatively high concentration of dissolved solutes, which results in a decreased tendency for water to move into that solution

## Source[^2]
- A solution that has a lot of solute has less water
- Another way of looking at it is a solution with a higher concentration will have a lower water potential
- As a result, water will move toward this solution because water travels from where there is more of it to where there is less of it
