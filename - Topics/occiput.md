The most favourable position for delivery is occipitoanterior (or occipital anterior), with the occiput of the fetus presenting towards the anterior aspect of the maternal pelvis as it enters the pelvic inlet. In the occipitotransverse (or occipital transverse) and occipitoposterior (or occipital posterior) positions, the occiput presents towards the lateral and posterior aspects, respectively, of the maternal pelvis; these are malpositions. $\textemdash$occipital adj.
