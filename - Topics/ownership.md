- Rights over property, including rights of possession, exclusive enjoyment, destruction, etc. In UK common law, land cannot be owned outright, as all land belongs to the Crown and is held in tenure by the 'owner'. However, an owner of an estate in land in fee simple is to all intents and purposes an outright owner. In general, ownership can be split between different persons. For example, a trustee has the legal ownership of trust property but the beneficiary has the equitable or beneficial ownership. If goods are stolen, the owner still has ownership but not possession. Similarly, if goods are hired or pledged to someone, the owner has ownership but no immediate right to possession.

- The right to exclusive use of an asset. The owner of an asset normally has the right to decide what use shall be made of it, and cannot be deprived of it except by law. The state, however, claims the right to regulate the use of many assets, and to tax income derived from them. The use that can be made of land and buildings is subject to planning permission, and rent from them is subject to income tax. The state also has rights of compulsory purchase of land needed for public works. Other people have contractual rights over assets, such as tenancies; and the general public has some rights, for example public rights of way. The extent to which ownership confers exclusive control over the use of an asset is thus a matter of degree. See also PUBLIC OWNERSHIP.
