- (1) The obligation, in contract law, that each party has to the other to disclose all the facts relevant to the subject matter of the contract. See UTMOST GOOD FAITH. 
- (2) The obligation, in company law, that a company has to disclose all relevant information and results of trading to its shareholders and other interested parties. The information is normally given in the directors' report and the annual accounts. 
- (3) The declaration of all relevant information about a company or a security in the interests of market transparency. In order for a company to be publicly traded in the US, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires it to make public all relevant financial or other information so that potential investors can be aware of any material facts that might affect their decisions. Likewise the Disclosure and Transparency Regulations of the UK Financial Conduct Authority require listed companies to disclose all relevant price-sensitive information. There are also detailed rules that oblige investors to disclose certain types of holding in listed companies (especially in relation to any takeover bid) and that require traders to disclose certain types of financial position (usually a short position).
