- $n$. A form of atropine, biochemically modified by the addition of a methyl radical, leaving the molecule with a positive charge and rendering it incapable of crossing the blood-brain barrier, so that it blocks peripheral acetylcholine neuroreceptors but allows brain acetylcholine systems to function normally. Compare METHYL SCOPOLAMINE. \[From methyl the alkyl radical $\mathrm{CH}_{3}$ derived from methane by removal of one hydrogen atom, from Greek methy wine + hyle wood + English atropine]
