- a chronic skin disease affecting the anogenital area (and rarely other sites), especially the vulva in women and foreskin in men. It is characterized by sheets of thin ivory-white skin and may be caused by chronic irritation by urine. There is a risk of squamous cell carcinoma. In women, the condition causes intense itching, and atrophy of the labia minora often occurs. Potent topical corticosteroids are helpful for women. In men, normal penile architecture is progressively lost and a constricting band around the foreskin may appear (causing sexual dysfunction and sometimes paraphimosis) or sometimes narrowing of the urethral meatus may occur. This sometimes necessitates circumcision.
