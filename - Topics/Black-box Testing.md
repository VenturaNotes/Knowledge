## Source[^2]
- A style of testing that considers only the inputs, the outputs, and the relationships specified between them to derive test inputs that will demonstrate that the required outputs occur. Usually the term is applied to software, but is also used for any system component (hence 'box') for which no knowledge of the internal structure or processing is used to derive the test (hence 'black'). Compare GLASS-BOX TESTING.
