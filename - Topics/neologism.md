- $n$. (in psychiatry) the invention of words that do not exist in one's language. It is common in childhood, but when it occurs in an adult it may be a symptom of a psychotic illness, such as schizophrenia. It should be distinguished from paraphasia, in which new meanings are attached to ordinary words.
