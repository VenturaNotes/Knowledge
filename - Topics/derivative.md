- (of a formal language)) The left-derivative of a language $L$, with respect to a word $w$, is

  

$$

\left\{u^{\prime} \mid w u^{\prime} \in L\right\}

$$

  

where $w w^{\prime}$ is the concatenation of $w$ and $w^{\prime}$. Similarly a right-derivative is

$$

\left\{u^{\prime} \mid u^{\prime} w \in L\right\}

$$
