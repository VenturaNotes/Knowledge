- Acronym for Broadcasters' Audience Research Board: a joint system for researching BBC and commercial television audiences, established in 1981. The board is responsible for commissioning television audience research, both quantitative (how many watched a particular programme) and qualitative (whether or not they liked the programme). The data is collected by online audimeters attached to the TV sets of more than 5000 representative households in the UK. Regional panels vary in size according to the size of the population in a television area. The data is downloaded daily. The meter records accurately when the TV is switched on, but does not indicate who is actually watching. Thus the research is supplemented by push button handsets for each member of the household aged over four years, to record when they started and finished watching. Data is made available to subscribers, who pay an annual registration fee.
