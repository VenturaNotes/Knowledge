- (hydrophthalmos) n. infantile or congenital glaucoma: increased pressure within the eye due to a defect in the development of the tissues through which fluid drains from the eye (the trabecular meshwork). Since the outer coat (sclera) of the eyeball of children is distensible, the eye enlarges as the inflow of fluid continues. It usually affects both eyes and may accompany congenital abnormalities in other parts of the body. Treatment is by surgical operation, e.g. goniotomy, to improve drainage of fluid from the eye. Spontaneous arrest of buphthalmos may occur before vision is completely lost.
