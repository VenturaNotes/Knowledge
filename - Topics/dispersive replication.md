## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A form of DNA replication in which the original DNA chain breaks and recombines in a random fashion before the double helix structure unwinds and separates to act as a template for messenger RNA synthesis. There is no evidence that it occurs in nature. Compare CONSERVATIVE REPLICATION; SEMICONSERVATIVE REPLICATION.
