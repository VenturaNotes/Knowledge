- (HIE, birth asphyxia, perinatal asphyxia) brain damage in a newborn infant as a result of the brain receiving inadequate oxygen. HIE may cause seizures and, if severe, death within minutes of oxygen deprivation. If the infant survives there can be significant long-term consequences, such as developmental delay, learning disabilities, or cerebral palsy.
