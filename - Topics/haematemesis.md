- $n$. the act of vomiting fresh blood. The blood may have been swallowed (e.g. following a nosebleed or tonsillectomy) but more often arises from bleeding in the oesophagus, stomach, or duodenum. Common causes of upper gastrointestinal bleeding are oesophageal varices or peptic ulcers. Vomited blood needs to be replaced by transfused blood. Gastroscopy may identify the source of bleeding and enables endoscopic treatments to arrest it. These include adrenaline injection, thermocoagulation with a heater-probe or by argon plasma coagulation, band ligation of oesophageal varices, glue injection for gastric varices, and the placement of metallic clips (endoclips) on bleeding vessels.
