- A good produced in the process of the production of some other good. Sale of a by-product makes production more profitable than if it had to be thrown away, or was costly to dispose of. For example, tar and other heavy fractions are the by-products of oil refining for petrol. The term by-product is used where one good (petrol) would be produced for its own sake even if the other (tar) were useless. This is distinguished from joint production, which is profitable only if both goods can be sold.

- A product from a process that has secondary economic significance compared to the main product of the process. For example, while the primary reason for cracking oil is to produce petroleum, other products produced as a result of the process, such as lubricating oil, paraffin, and other distillates, are by-products. See also PROCESS COSTING.
## Source[^3]
- A compound formed during a chemical reaction at the same time as the main product. Commercially useful by-products are obtained from a number of industrial processes. For example, calcium chloride is a byproduct of the Solvay process for making sodium carbonate. Propanone is a by-product in the manufacture of phenol.
