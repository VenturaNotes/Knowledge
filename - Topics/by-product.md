- A good produced in the process of the production of some other good. Sale of a by-product makes production more profitable than if it had to be thrown away, or was costly to dispose of. For example, tar and other heavy fractions are the by-products of oil refining for petrol. The term by-product is used where one good (petrol) would be produced for its own sake even if the other (tar) were useless. This is distinguished from joint production, which is profitable only if both goods can be sold.
