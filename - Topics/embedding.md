- In general, an embedding of $X$ in $Y$ is an injection $f: X \to Y$ such that the intrinsic structure of $X$ agrees with the structure inherited extrinsically from the ambient space $Y$. This is commonly denoted as $f: X \hookrightarrow Y$.
- In algebra this means that the map is an isomorphism onto its image, in topology a homeomorphism onto its image, etc. For smooth manifolds, a smooth embedding is a diffeomorphism onto its image such that the differential is injective everywhere. this means that the image will also be a smooth manifold.
