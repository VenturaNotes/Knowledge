- In general, an embedding of $X$ in $Y$ is an injection $f: X \to Y$ such that the intrinsic structure of $X$ agrees with the structure inherited extrinsically from the ambient space $Y$. This is commonly denoted as $f: X \hookrightarrow Y$.
- In algebra this means that the map is an isomorphism onto its image, in topology a homeomorphism onto its image, etc. For smooth manifolds, a smooth embedding is a diffeomorphism onto its image such that the differential is injective everywhere. this means that the image will also be a smooth manifold. 
## Source[^2]
- (1) A method of including information from one application in another. For instance, a graph from a spreadsheet, the source, could be embedded in a word-processor document, the destination. Embedding is different from copying in that the application that created the embedded information can be started up from within the destination application if any modification is required. Embedding is also different from linking, where no information is copied into the destination, only the whereabouts of the source and what application created it. See also OBJECT LINKING AND EMBEDDING. 
- (2) In software, a low-level assembly language could be embedded into a higher-level language to, for example, speed up operation or provide a special function. 
- (3) The inclusion of fonts in a document, as in a PostScript or PDF file.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. (in microscopy) the fixing of a specimen within a mass of firm material in order to facilitate the cutting of thin sections for microscopical study. The embedding medium, e.g. paraffin wax for light microscopy or Araldite for electron microscopy, helps to keep the specimen intact.
## Source[^4]
- A stage in the preparation of a sample for examination by microscopy that involves impregnation of the sample with wax or plastic following dehydration. The embedded sample can then be cut into extremely thin sections to reveal cellular and subcellular structure.
