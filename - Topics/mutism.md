- $n$. inability or refusal to speak. Innate speechlessness most commonly occurs in those who have been totally deaf since birth; this was formerly referred to as deaf-mutism but the term is now deprecated, as it implies wrongly that those affected are unable to make vocal sounds or to communicate effectively in other ways (sign language). Inability to speak may result from brain damage (see APHASIA). It may also be caused by depression, psychosis, or psychological trauma, in which case the patient either does not speak at all or speaks only to particular persons or in particular situations. This latter condition is called selective mutism.
- Treatment of mutism due to psychological causes is now increasingly by behavioral means, such as prompting: people that the patient does not address are slowly introduced into the situation where the patient does speak. This may be done either alone or in combination with more traditional psychotherapy. Psychotic or depressive mutism or catatonia are addressed by treating the underlying condition. $\textendash$mute adj., $n$.
