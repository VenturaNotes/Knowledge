- 1. (in animal physiology) Focusing: the process by which the focal length of the lens of the eye is changed so that clear images of objects at a range of distances are displayed on the retina. In humans and some other mammals accommodation is achieved by reflex adjustments in the shape of the lens brought about by relaxation and contraction of muscles within the ciliary body. 
- 2. (in animal behavior) Adjustments made by an animal's nervous or sensory systems in response to continuously changing environmental conditions.

- (1) The voluntary or involuntary adjustment of the curvature of the crystalline lens of the eye to keep an image focused on the fovea with changes in the distance of the object being viewed; more specifically, one of the monocular cues of visual depth perception, the degree of curvature of the lenses providing information about the distances of objects focused on the retinas. Also called visual accommodation . See also accommodation reflex, dark focus, far point, near point, Purkinje-SANSON IMAGE, RANGE OF ACCOMMODATION. 
- (2) In the writings of the Swiss psychologist Jean Piaget (1896-1980) and his followers, a form of adaptation (3) in which psychological structures or processes are modified to fit the changing demands of the environment, as when an infant adapts its perceptual processes and behavioral repertoire to a new toy that is introduced into its milieu. See also equilibration. Compare assimilation (2). 
- (3) A decrease in a neuron's propensity to produce an action potential, the reduced responsiveness being caused by repeated stimulation. accommodate $v b$. accommodative adj. Compare assimilation (2). \[From Latin accommodare to accommodate, from ad to + commodus fitting + -ation indicating a process or condition]
## Source[^3]
- $n$. adjustment of the shape of the lens to change the focus of the eye. When the ciliary muscle (see CILIARY BODY) is relaxed, suspensory ligaments attached to the ciliary body and holding the lens in position are stretched, which causes the lens to be flattened. The eye is then able to focus on distant objects. To focus the eye on near objects the ciliary muscles contract and the tension in the ligaments is thus lowered, allowing the lens to become rounder. Adjustments in convergence also contribute to accommodation.
