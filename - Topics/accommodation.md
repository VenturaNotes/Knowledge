- 1. (in animal physiology) Focusing: the process by which the focal length of the lens of the eye is changed so that clear images of objects at a range of distances are displayed on the retina. In humans and some other mammals accommodation is achieved by reflex adjustments in the shape of the lens brought about by relaxation and contraction of muscles within the ciliary body. 
- 2. (in animal behavior) Adjustments made by an animal's nervous or sensory systems in response to continuously changing environmental conditions.
