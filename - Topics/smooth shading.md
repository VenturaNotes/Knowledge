- A class of shading methods that give a continuous appearance over functions and structures. The fairness, or overall smoothness, of curves and surfaces is of particular interest. Definitions of smoothness may be based on extreme or average quantities (e.g. curvature) or on subjective assessment. They may also be linked to fluiddynamics considerations.
