- The time taken to retrieve an item of information from storage. The access time may be counted in nanoseconds for a semiconductor device, in milliseconds for a magnetic disk, or in minutes if the file containing the required data is on magnetic tape. 
- In the case of disk storage, the access time is the average time taken for a disk drive to provide the first byte of data, measured from the time the host issues a read command. To a good approximation, the average access time is the sum of the average seek time, the command overhead, and the average latency. See also MEMORY HIERARCHY.
