## Source [^1]
- An enzyme that is able to join together two portions of DNA and therefore plays an important role in DNA repair. DNA ligase is also used in recombinant DNA technology (see GENETIC ENGINEERING) as it ensures that the foreign DNA (e.g. the complementary DNA used in gene cloning) is bound to the plasmid into which it is incorporated.
