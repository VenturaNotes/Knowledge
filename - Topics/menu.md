- A list of options that may be displayed either vertically or horizontally on a screen and from which one or more items may be selected using an input device. If a mouse or other pointing device is available, then the cursor may be moved to the desired item and a selection made by clicking a mouse button or its equivalent. Alternatively the cursor may be moved by means of the arrow keys on the keyboard. Each item in the menu may have a unique number or letter to identify it, or the first or some other character unique to the item may be emphasized in some way. In this case, the selection may be made by pressing the appropriate key on the keyboard. See also POP-UP MENU, PULL-DOWN MENU, TEAR-OFF MENU.
