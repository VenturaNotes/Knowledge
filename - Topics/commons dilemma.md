- $n$. A type of resource dilemma interpreted as a problem of overgrazing on a common pasture, illustrated by the following simple example. Three farmers each own a single cow weighing $1,000 \mathrm{~kg}$ and have access to a common that can sustain a maximum of three cows without deterioration. They all want to increase their wealth by adding a further cow to the common, but for each additional cow on the common the weight of every cow decreases by 200 kg . If one farmer adds a cow, then that farmer's personal wealth increases from $1,000 \mathrm{~kg}$ (one $1,000 \mathrm{~kg}$ cow) to $1,600 \mathrm{~kg}$ (two 800 kg cows); if two farmers add a cow each, then the wealth of each increases from $1,000 \mathrm{~kg}$ to $1,200 \mathrm{~kg}$ (two 600 kg cows); and if all three add a cow each, then the wealth of each decreases from $1,000 \mathrm{~kg}$ to 800 kg (two 400 kg cows), and each farmer is poorer than if each had acted cooperatively by not adding a further cow to the common. It is always in a farmer's individual self-interest to acquire an additional cow, whether or not one or more of the others does so, but if they all pursue individual self-interest in this way, then each ends up poorer than if they all cooperate, which means that the problem is a social dilemma. \[So called because of a reference in 1833 in an essay on population growth by the English economist William Forster Lloyd (1795-1852) to the 'tragedy of the commons'$\textemdash$the overgrazing of the commons in 14th-century England, which led to the enclosures and the eventual disappearance of many of the commons]
