- a computer algorithm that estimates the risk of a heart attack or stroke in a person over the next ten years. QRISK2 uses traditional risk factors, such as age, systolic blood pressure, smoking status, and ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein, together with additional risk factors, including body mass index and family history of premature ischaemic heart disease. Someone with a QRISK2 score of 20% (or more) is regarded as high risk and should consider lifestyle modification and preventative medication.
