- $n$. The proposition that choice reaction time increases as the logarithm of the number of alternatives. The law is usually expressed by the formula $R T=a+b \log _{2}(n+1)$, where $a$ and $b$ are constants representing the intercept and slope of the function, respectively, and $n$ is the number of alternatives. It was first documented by the German psychologist Julius Merkel (1834-1900) in the journal Philosophische Studien in 1885, therefore the name by which it is usually known is a misnomer and there is a strong case for calling it Merkel's law. Compare Fitts' law. \[Named after the English physician W(illiam) Edmund Hick (1912-74) who reformulated it in 1952]
