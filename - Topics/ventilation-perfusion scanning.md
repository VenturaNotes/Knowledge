- (V/Q scanning) a nuclear medicine technique in which two different isotopes are used, one inhaled (usually xenon-133 or krypton-81m), to examine lung ventilation, and the other injected into a vein, to examine lung perfusion. In pulmonary embolism, the area of lung supplied by the blocked artery is not being perfused with blood $\textendash$ which gives a perfusion defect on the film $\textendash$ but has normal ventilation. This technique is highly sensitive for pulmonary embolism.
