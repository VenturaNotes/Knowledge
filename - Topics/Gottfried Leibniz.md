- (1646-1716) German philosopher and mathematician. One of the supreme polymath intellects of the 17th century, his significance to the future science of computing was his exploration of binary numbers and arithmetic, which interested him from an early age and was fully laid out in his Explication de l'arithm√©tique binaire (1703). His many other contributions to knowledge include the philosophical theory of monads and the invention of calculus as it is used today (1675, published in 1684; Isaac Newton, who had independently discovered calculus earlier but did not publish until later, falsely contended that Leibniz had stolen ideas from his unpublished notes).
