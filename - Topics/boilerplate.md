- Boilerplate is a term used to describe any form of writing that can be reused multiple times without requiring the original content to be altered extensively. In other words, a boilerplate is a template that provides users with a basic document structure that can be suited to user needs. Corporations, such as legal firms and medical institutions, often use boilerplates to produce uniform documentation. Popular boilerplate templates include responsibility disclaimers, safety warnings, instruction manuals, and contracts. In the information technology industry, boilerplate code is open-source computer code that can be used multiple times in the coding process, only requiring programmers to rework small portions of the code as needed.
