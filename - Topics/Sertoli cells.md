- cells found in the walls of the seminiferous tubules of the testis. Compared with the germ cells they appear large and pale. They anchor and probably nourish the developing germ cells, especially the spermatids, which become partly embedded within them. A Sertoli-cell tumour is a rare testicular tumour causing feminization. \[E. Sertoli (1842-1910), Italian histologist]
## Source[^2]
- (sustentacular cells) Cells that line the seminiferous tubules in the testis. Named after Italian histologist Enrico Sertoli (1842-1910), Sertoli cells protect the spermatids and convey nutrients to both the developing and mature spermatozoa. They also produce a hormone, inhibin, which can inhibit follicle-stimulating hormone and thereby regulate production of spermatozoa.
