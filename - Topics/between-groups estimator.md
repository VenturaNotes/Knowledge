- An estimator of the vector of the parameters in a linear regression model with panel data, computed as an ordinary least squares (OLS) estimator using time averages of the data for each crosssection unit (group means). It is consistent when OLS on the pooled data is consistent, but is inefficient relative to generalized least squares. See also PANEL DATA; WITHIN-GROUPS ESTIMATOR.
