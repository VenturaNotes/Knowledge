- (1) The policy of connecting such economic variables as wages, taxes, social-security payments, annuities, or pensions to rises in the general price level. This policy is often advocated by economists in the belief that it mitigates the effects of inflation. In practice, complete indexation is rarely possible, so that inflation usually leaves somebody worse off (e.g. lenders, savers) and somebody better off (borrowers). See Retail Price Index. 
- (2) The practice of adjusting the chargeable gain from the sale of an asset to take account of inflation over the period of ownership of the asset. In the UK corporation tax system an indexation factor derived from the rise in the Retail Price Index during the period of ownership is applied to the cost, or 31 March 1982 value, of an asset. The indexed cost or value is then deducted from the proceeds of sale on disposal of the asset, in order to establish the chargeable gain. Until April 1998 indexation was also applied to gains chargeable to capital gains tax. In the case of assets acquired before that date and disposed of before April 2008, the indexation allowance was calculated to 5 April 1998 and this figure was used to calculate the chargeable gain.
