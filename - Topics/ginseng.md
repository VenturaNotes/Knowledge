## Source [^1]
- $n$. A plant of the genus Panax (Panax schinseng in China or Panax quinquefolius in North America) whose roots contain ginsenosides, used in Chinese medicine for their tonic, stimulant, or restorative effects. Its pharmacological action is poorly understood, though it is believed to involve enhancement of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis in the body. Also taken as a smart drug with a wide range of supposed mental and physical benefits and as an aphrodisiac. \[From Mandarin Chinese jen a man, from the resemblance of the roots to human legs + shen spirit]
