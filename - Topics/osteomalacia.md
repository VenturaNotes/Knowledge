- $n$. softening of the bones due to inadequate mineralization: it is the adult counterpart of rickets. Causes include insufficient calcium absorption from the intestine due to dietary deficiency or vitamin D deficiency, the latter resulting from lack of sunshine, intestinal malabsorption, liver or kidney disease, or anticonvulsant medication. The most common symptoms are bone pain, backache, and muscle weakness. The characteristic X-ray finding is a thin transverse radiolucent band (a Looser zone) in an otherwise normal-looking bone. Treatment usually involves large doses of vitamin D.
