- malignancy of the large intestine (i.e. the colon, appendix, and rectum). It is the fourth most common cause of death from cancer: one million people are diagnosed each year. Most cases should be preventable by screening and surveillance protocols (including the faecal occult blood test) and modifiable lifestyle factors. Risk factors include older age, increased consumption of red meat and fatty foods, excessive alcohol intake, smoking, and sedentary lifestyle. Clinical symptoms include change in bowel habit, rectal bleeding, loss of appetite and weight, anaemia, and gastrointestinal obstruction. Diagnosis is made following analysis of samples taken during colonoscopy. CT scanning of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis defines the extent of the disease; MRI and PET scanning may yield additional radiological information. These findings are assessed using the TNM classification. Early localized disease is amenable to surgery, preoperative chemoradiation, and postoperative chemotherapy; advanced disease with metastases necessitates a palliative approach.
