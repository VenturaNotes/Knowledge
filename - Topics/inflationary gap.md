- The difference between the total spending in an economy (both private and public) and the total spending that would be needed to maintain full employment in a given time period.
## Source[^2]
- The excess of the actual level of activity in the economy over the level corresponding to the non-accelerating inflation rate of unemployment. If the inflationary gap is positive, inflation tends to speed up, and the larger the inflationary gap, the faster inflation speeds up. An inflationary gap thus gives rise to demand inflation.
