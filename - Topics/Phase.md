- A phase is a distinct and homogeneous state of a system with no visible boundary separating it into parts

## Source[^2]
- (of a regularly recurring (periodic) quantity) The stage or state of development of the quantity. It can be expressed, in the form of an angle, as the fraction of a cycle of the periodic quantity that has been completed, with respect to a fixed datum point. Two sinusoidally varying quantities of the same frequency can be in phase (reaching corresponding phases at the same time) or out of phase. In the latter case the difference in phase-the phase difference-is usually expressed as an angle.
