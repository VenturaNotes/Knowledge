## Source [^1]
- A phase is a distinct and homogeneous state of a system with no visible boundary separating it into parts

## Source[^2]
- (of a regularly recurring (periodic) quantity) The stage or state of development of the quantity. It can be expressed, in the form of an angle, as the fraction of a cycle of the periodic quantity that has been completed, with respect to a fixed datum point. Two sinusoidally varying quantities of the same frequency can be in phase (reaching corresponding phases at the same time) or out of phase. In the latter case the difference in phase-the phase difference-is usually expressed as an angle.
## Source[^3]
- In physics and mathematics, a phase is a term used to describe the position of a point in time on a waveform cycle. When comparing two or more waveforms, the motion of the waves is considered “in phase” when corresponding points reach their maximum or minimum displacement threshold at the same time.
## Source[^4]
- $n$. Any distinct or characteristic period or stage in a process or a sequence of development or evolution, including especially a particular stage (such as the peak or the trough) in the cycle of a periodic oscillation or wave. \[From Greek phasis a phase, from phaein to shine, alluding to the phases of the moon]
