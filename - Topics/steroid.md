## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. one of a group of compounds having a common structure based on the steroid nucleus, which consists of three six-membered carbon rings and one five-membered carbon ring. The naturally occurring steroids include the male and female sex hormones (androgens and oestrogens), the hormones of the adrenal cortex (see CORTICOSTEROID), progesterone, bile salts, and sterols. Synthetic steroids have been produced for therapeutic purposes.
## Source[^2]
- Any of a group of lipids derived from a saturated compound called cyclopentanoperhydrophenanthrene, which has a nucleus of four rings (see formulae). Some of the most important steroid derivatives are the steroid alcohols, or sterols, such as cholesterol. Other steroids include the bile acids, which aid digestion of fats in the intestine; the sex hormones (androgens and oestrogens); and the corticosteroid hormones, produced by the adrenal cortex. Vitamin D is also based on the steroid structure.
