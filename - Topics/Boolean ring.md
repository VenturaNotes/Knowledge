- A ring in which $x^{2}=x$ for all elements. A Boolean algebra $(R, \lor, \land, \neg)$ can be associated with a Boolean ring $(R,+, \times)$ with a 1 by defining:$$x \vee y=x+y+x \times y, x \wedge y=x \times y, \neg x=1+x.$$The power set $\wp(X)$ is such a Boolean ring with symmetric difference, intersection, complement, $1=X$, and the Boolean algebra associated with it has operations union, intersection, and complement.
