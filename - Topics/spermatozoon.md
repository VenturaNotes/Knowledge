- (sperm) n. (pl. spermatozoa) a mature male sex cell (see GAMETE). The tail of a sperm enables it to swim, which is important as a means for reaching and fertilizing the ovum (although muscular movements of the uterus may assist its journey from the vagina). See also ACROSOME; FERTILIZATION.

## Source[^2]
- (sperm) (pl. spermatozoa) The mature mobile reproductive cell (see GAMETE) of male animals, which is produced by the testis (see SPERMATOGENESIS). It consists of a head section containing a haploid nucleus and an acrosome, which allows the sperm to penetrate the egg at fertilization; a middle section containing mitochondria to provide the energy for movement; and a tail section, which contains a single flagellum (sense 2) that lashes to drive the sperm forward.
