- $n$. A close relative of Russell's paradox, expressed in terms of a village in which there is a barber who shaves all and only those men who do not shave themselves. From this it follows that if this barber shaves himself, then he does not, and if he does not, then he does. It was first published in 1918 by the Welsh philosopher Bertrand (Arthur William) Russell (1872-1970), who attributed it to an unnamed source.
