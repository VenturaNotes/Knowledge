- A Multi-experience Development Platform (MXDP) is designed to program, manage and analyze multiple programs at the same time. However, these apps are referred to as 'multi-experience' because of the multiple methods of input and management they have. For example, these apps can be modified via sound, touch, gestures, or more.
