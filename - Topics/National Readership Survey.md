- (NRS) A non-profit organization that provides publishers, advertisers, and others with estimated readership figures for over 250 newspapers and magazines in the UK. Readership is also analyzed in terms of sex, age, region, social class, and a range of other demographic and lifestyle characteristics. The data is derived from a stratified random sample involving some 36,000 computer-assisted interviews in a continuous survey lasting 12 months. Updated data is published online four times a year. Since 2012 NRS has also provided figures for the reach of non-print platforms, such as the online versions of daily newspapers.
