- Substances given off by the activities of people or by productive processes. Emissions may be solid particles or liquids deposited in rivers or the sea, or solid particles and gases put into the atmosphere. Economic policies related to the environment are concerned with emissions which have adverse external effects on people, animals, or plants. Pollution can be reduced in the short run by taxing or restricting activities involving harmful emissions, and in the longer run by research on alternative productive techniques involving fewer or less harmful emissions.
