- abbrev. Basic period of information processing, generally taken to be equal to about 62.5 milliseconds ever since the US inventor and scientist Thomas (Alva) Edison (1847-1931) discovered that 16 frames per second was the minimum rate for critical flicker fusion ($62.5=1 / 16 \times 1,000$), though some psychologists have claimed that the precise figure varies slightly, depending on the observer's IQ. The concept was introduced in an article by the German psychologists Siegfried Lehrl (born 1943) and Bernd Fischer (born 1939) in the European Journal of Personality in 1990.
