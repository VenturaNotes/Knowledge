- In standard set theory, an element either is or is not a member of a particular set. However, in some instances, for example in pattern recognition or decision-making, it may not be known whether an element is in the set. Fuzzy set theory blurs this distinction and replaces this binary option with the interval $[0, 1]$ with, possibly, the value representing a probability that an element is a member of a particular set.
