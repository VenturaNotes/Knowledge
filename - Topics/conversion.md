- The tort (civil wrong) equivalent to the crime of theft. It is possible to bring an action in respect of conversion to recover damages, but this is uncommon.

- $n$. (in psychiatry) the expression of conflict as physical symptoms. Psychoanalysts believe that the repressed instinctual drive is manifested as motor or sensory loss, such as paralysis, rather than as speech or action. This is thought to be one of the ways in which conversion disorder is produced. An easier way to conceptualize conversion is as a physical expression of emotional distress.

- $n$. A qualitative alteration in form, character, or function. In psychoanalysis, a defence mechanism in which an unconscious conflict that would otherwise arouse anxiety is expressed symbolically, the repressed wish or idea being transformed into a physical symptom, such as a pain, paralysis, or loss of sensory function. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced the concept in 1894 in an article on 'The Neuro-Psychoses of Defence' (Standard Edition, III, pp. 45-61, at p. 49) and developed it further in 1908/9 in an article entitled 'Some General Remarks on Hysterical Attacks' (Standard Edition, IX, pp. 229-33). See also CONVERSION DISORDER, CONVERSION HYSTERIA.
