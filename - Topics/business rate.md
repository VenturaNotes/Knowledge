- A UK tax on business premises which is levied to finance local authorities. The rate per pound of valuation at which the business rate is levied used to be decided by the local authorities themselves, but it is now set at a common national level known as the uniform business rate. The valuation of premises for rating purposes is decided by a District Valuer.
