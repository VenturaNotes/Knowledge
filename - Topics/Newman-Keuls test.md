- $n$. In statistics, a method of multiple comparisons in which the group means are ranked from smallest to largest, and then the statistic that is used to test for a significant difference between a pair of means is computed on the basis of the number of steps between the two means in the rank order. Also called Student-Newman-Keuls procedure. Compare Bonferroni correction, Duncan's multiple range test, least-significant difference test, Scheff√© test, Tukey-HSD test. \[Named after the English statistician Dennis Newman (1916-88) who published a preliminary article on the test in the journal Biometrika in 1939 and the Dutch statistician Matthijs Keuls who developed it further in an article in the journal Euphytica in 1952]
