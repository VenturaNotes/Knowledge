- Ping refers to a utility that tests the connectivity between devices on a network by sending a small data packet to a target device and measuring the time it takes for a response to be received 
	- Indicates how quickly a device can be reached and proving a basic measure of [[network latency]]
- The term "ping" is derived from a [[sonar]] concept of sending out a pulse and measuring the time it takes for the echo to return
- A low ping value indicates a fast and responsive connection, while a high ping value suggests network latency or connectivity issues.
	- The time taken for a ping request to reach a device and return is measured in milliseconds (ms
- Ping uses the [[ICMP|Internet Control Message Protocol]]
- Used to check if a device is reachable on a network and to assess the responsiveness of the connection

- Ping uses [[ICMP]]

## Source[^3]
- A short message that an application sends from one system on a network to another (or, as a verb, to send such a message), primarily to establish whether the receiver is active, or the network linking sender and receiver is operational. A system receiving a ping will typically respond by immediately retransmitting the incoming message back to the original sender. (The word ping may be an acronym for packet Internet gopher or possibly imitative in origin.)
