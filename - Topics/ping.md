- Ping refers to a utility that tests the connectivity between devices on a network by sending a small data packet to a target device and measuring the time it takes for a response to be received 
	- Indicates how quickly a device can be reached and proving a basic measure of [[network latency]]
- The term "ping" is derived from a [[sonar]] concept of sending out a pulse and measuring the time it takes for the echo to return
- A low ping value indicates a fast and responsive connection, while a high ping value suggests network latency or connectivity issues.
	- The time taken for a ping request to reach a device and return is measured in milliseconds (ms
- Ping uses the Internet Control Message Protocol
- Used to check if a device is reachable on a network and to assess the responsiveness of the connection
