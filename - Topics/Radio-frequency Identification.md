- Radio-frequency identification (or RFID) is a technology that uses radio frequency waves to automate data collection. It is included in a group of technologies known as Automatic Identification and Capture (AIDC) and is comparable to the way that barcodes (when scanned with an optical scanner) are able to retrieve information. With RFID, however, the data is embedded into the tag or smart label along with a circuit and an antenna. RFID tags are commonly used in retail to better manage inventory and deter theft.
