- (beta richness) (in ecology) The rate, magnitude, and direction of change in species diversity (see Biodiversity) between different habitats or communities. It is thus a measure of the heterogeneity between the various habitats. When combined with the alpha diversity (i.e. diversity of individual communities) it gives a measure of regional species diversity, or gamma diversity.
