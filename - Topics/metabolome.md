- The entire complement of metabolites found within a cell under defined conditions, such as a particular physiological or developmental state. The metabolome is determined using various forms of high-throughput mass spectrometry. It excludes nucleic acids and other large molecules, giving a ‘snapshot’ of the cell’s metabolic state. See METABOLOMICS.
