- (termination sequence) A sequence of bases in DNA that signals the termination of transcription of a gene or operon and release of the RNA transcript from the RNA polymerase. Prokaryotes have two different mechanisms of termination: rho-dependent termination involves binding of a protein transcription factor called rho to a specific site on the newly formed transcript. Meanwhile, the RNA polymerase stalls at a site downstream on the DNA molecule called a transcription stop point. Rho then moves along the transcript to the RNA polymerase and causes the transcript to dissociate from the template strand of the DNA. In rho-independent termination, the end of a gene is marked by a particular sequence called an inverted repeat, followed by a string of adenine (A) bases. This causes the RNA transcript to form a hairpin loop structure followed by a string of uracil (U) bases. The hairpin loop causes the RNA polymerase to stall, and the weak binding between the Us on the RNA and the As on the DNA template strand enables release of the RNA transcript. In eukaryotes, the mechanism of termination varies according to the type of RNA polymerase. Specific terminator sequences have been identified for types I and III RNA polymerases, whereas termination for RNA polymerase type II, responsible for transcribing protein-coding genes, is more complex, with cleavage of the pre-messenger RNA occurring before the polymerase has stopped transcribing.
