- (1) A statement made clearly in a contract (express warranty) or, if not stated clearly, understood between the parties to the contract (see IMPLIED WARRANTY). An unfulfilled warranty does not invalidate the contract (as it would in the case of an unfulfilled condition) but could lead to the payment of damages. See also Floating Warranty. 
- (2) A condition in an insurance policy that confirms that something will or will not be done or that a certain situation exists or does not exist. If a warranty is breached, the insurer is entitled to refuse to pay claims, even if they are unconnected with the breach. For example, if a policy insuring the contents of a house has a warranty that certain locks are to be used on the doors and windows and these are found not to have been used, the insurers could decline to settle a claim for a burst pipe. In practice, however, this does not happen as insurers have agreed that they will only refuse to pay claims if the breach of warranty has affected the circumstances of the claim. 
- (3) A manufacturer's written promise to repair or replace a faulty product, usually free of charge, during a specified period subsequent to the date of purchase. This is often called a guarantee.
