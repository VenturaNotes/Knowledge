- Infertility and an increased incidence of chromosome mutations that is observed in the progeny of laboratory-reared organisms crossed with wild organisms. Hybrid dysgenesis has been best studied in strains of Drosophila fruit flies, when laboratory females are crossed with wild males; it is thought to be caused by transposable elements (see TRANSPOSON) in the wild-type males, which are activated in eggs from certain strains of laboratory females.
