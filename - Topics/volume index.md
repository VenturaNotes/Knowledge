- An index of the real level of production or consumption, in the whole economy or some part of it. A volume index is a weighted average of the production or consumption of some suitably chosen bundle of goods. The weights are the prices in some period. Where 0 is the base period and $t$ the current period, $p_{i t}$ the price and $q_{i t}$ the quantity of good $i$ produced or consumed in period $t$, a base-weighted, or Laspeyres, volume index is defined by$$q_{B}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i 0} q_{i t} / \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i 0} q_{i 0}$$and a current-weighted, or Paasche, volume index is defined by$$q_{C}=\sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i t} q_{i t} / \sum_{i=1}^{n} p_{i t} q_{i 0}.$$
