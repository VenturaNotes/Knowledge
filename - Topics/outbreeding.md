- $n$. the production of offspring by parents who are not closely related. Compare INBREEDING.

Outbreeding populations usually show more variation than inbreeding ones and have a greater potential for adapting to environmental changes. Outbreeding increases the number of heterozygous individuals, so disadvantageous recessive characteristics tend to be masked by dominant alleles.
