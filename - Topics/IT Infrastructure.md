- IT infrastructureÂ refers to the components that fulfill IT services and processes. These components include:
- Hardware such as servers, modems, and data centers Software such as customer relationship management (CRM) systems Network resources such as firewalls
- Without resources such as networks and servers, a business can't achieve its operational goals. Traditional IT infrastructure lets organizations manage hardware, software, and network resources on-premise. Modern infrastructure allows for the management of these components in a virtualized environment. Many vendors offer cloud-based infrastructure solutions such as Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS).
