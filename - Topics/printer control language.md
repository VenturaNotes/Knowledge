- PCL was originally introduced by Hewlett-Packard in its early laser printers and evolved as a de facto standard for high-quality printers. The commands cover text, formatting, paper handling, and graphics. The language has developed over time and is often used to define the facilities offered by a printer, as in 'This printer supports PCL6.'
