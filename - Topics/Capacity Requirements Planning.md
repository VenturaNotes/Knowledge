- Capacity requirements planning (CRP) is the process of determining future needs for resources (facilities, equipment, and human resources) to support business goals. CRP is found primarily in manufacturing, where businesses figure out their available production capacity, assess the planned manufacturing schedule, and determine whether current capacity can successfully meet future needs.
