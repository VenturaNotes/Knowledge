- The exchange of one type of good or service for another without the use of money. This developed to allow society to take advantage of the division of labour and the gains from specialization. Barter, however, is often inconvenient: a person who has goods of one type and wants goods of another has to find somebody who wishes to make the opposite exchange, either for their own use (a joint coincidence of wants) or as a professional intermediary. The use of precious metals as a medium of exchange, and the subsequent development of money, removed this inconvenience. Until recently barter was only used when the monetary system had broken down, in countries subject to civil disorder or hyperinflation, or for international transactions by countries with inadequate supplies of foreign exchange. The use of barter is now increasing due to websites that connect parties with a joint coincidence of wants.

- A method of trading in which goods or services are exchanged without the use of money. It is a cumbersome system, which severely limits the scope for trade. Money, used as a medium of exchange, enables individuals to trade with each other at much greater distance and through whole chains of intermediaries, which are inconceivable in a barter system. The modern equivalent of barter is known as countertrading.
