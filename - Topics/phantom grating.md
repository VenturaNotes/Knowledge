- $n$. An illusory grating of vertical bars that is seen in a blank area of an image when the rest of the image, on both sides of the blank area, consists of a real grating moving slowly in one direction. The phantom grating moves along with the real grating, as if the real grating were moving under the paper and could be seen faintly through it, but the phantom disappears if the real grating stops moving, suggesting that the phantom is activated by direction-sensitive neurons in the retina. See also apparent movement. \[From Greek phantasma an illusion, from phantazein to make visible, from phainein to show, from phaein to shine]
