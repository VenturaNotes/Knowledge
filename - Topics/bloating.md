- $n$. the subjective experience of abdominal fullness, often (but not always) accompanied by abdominal distension. Its many causes include air swallowing (aerophagia), abnormal intestinal gas handling or abdominal wall reflexes, increased gas production, and organ hypersensitivity. Bloating may be associated with increased belching, excessive flatus, or changes in bowel habit, particularly constipation. It tends to be aggravated by meals, fluctuates in severity throughout the day (with particular discomfort in the evening), and is relieved at night. Treatment includes the removal of exacerbating factors (such as specific dietary products), avoidance of carbonated drinks and fat-rich diets, reduction in dietary fibre, and reassurance. Drug therapy has limited efficacy, but antispasmodics, laxatives, peppermint oil, simeticone, prokinetics (such as domperidone), nonabsorbable antibiotics (rifaximin), and tricyclic antidepressants (to reduce hypersensitivity) may be tried.
