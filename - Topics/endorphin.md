- (endomorphin) $n$. one of a group of chemical compounds, similar to the encephalins, that occur naturally in the brain and have painrelieving properties similar to those of the opiates. They are also responsible for sensations of pleasure. The endorphins are derived from a substance found in the pituitary gland known as beta-lipotrophin; they are thought to be concerned with controlling the activity of the endocrine glands.
## Source[^2]
- Any of a class of three endogenous opioids$\textemdash$$\alpha\text{-}, \beta\text{-}$  and $\gamma$-endorphins$\textemdash$found naturally in brain and other tissues that have pain-relieving effects similar to those of morphine. They are released during physical or emotional stress, such as childbirth or strenuous exercise, and can produce feelings of euphoria. All are peptides or polypeptides derived from the precursor pro-opiomelanocortin; for example, $\beta$-endorphin is a 31-amino-acid peptide. The endorphins mediate their analgesic effects by binding to opioid receptors. See also DYNORPHIN; ENKEPHALIN.
