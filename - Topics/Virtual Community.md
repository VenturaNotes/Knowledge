- The term virtually community was first defined by Howard Rheingold in his book “The Virtual Community.” He describes a virtual community as a social group that emerges from the internet when people invest in interactions with fellow internet users. In other words, a virtual community is a group of individuals who share common interests and interact over a digital platform. Since virtual communities interact over the internet, there is little need for their members to live in the same geographical region. Virtual communities typically congregate over social media platforms, message boards, and chat rooms. Businesses often build virtual communities with their target audience on social media platforms as a marketing channel to build brand awareness and upsell their products and services.
