- A curve on a graph in which the yield on deposits or fixed-interest securities is plotted against the length of time they have to run to maturity. The yield curve usually slopes upwards, indicating that investors expect to receive a premium for holding securities that have a long time to run. However, a downward-sloping or negative yield curve may occur when the market anticipates falling interest rates or deflation. A flat or 'humped' yield curve is usually taken as a sign of market uncertainty.
## Source[^2]
- A graph plotting the yield on fixed-interest securities against their years to maturity. As longer-dated securities are more subject to price fluctuations if interest rates change, and are thus less liquid than shorterdated securities, it is usually expected that if interest rates are equally likely to rise or fall the yield curve slopes upwards; that is, longer-dated securities will have higher yields than shorter-dated ones. This slope may be temporarily reversed if interest rates are generally expected to fall, as the expectation of higher capital gains on longer-dated securities makes them relatively attractive to hold.
