- A curve on a graph in which the yield on deposits or fixed-interest securities is plotted against the length of time they have to run to maturity. The yield curve usually slopes upwards, indicating that investors expect to receive a premium for holding securities that have a long time to run. However, a downward-sloping or negative yield curve may occur when the market anticipates falling interest rates or deflation. A flat or 'humped' yield curve is usually taken as a sign of market uncertainty.
