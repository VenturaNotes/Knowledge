- Employee productivity can be defined as an assessment of the value an individual employee generates within a specific period of time. Since the success of a business depends on the productivity of its employees, employee productivity is an important metric for companies to track. Typically, an employee ªs productivity rate is measured against a baseline productivity rate for a group of employees doing similar work to assess how efficient an individual is at completing an assigned task.
