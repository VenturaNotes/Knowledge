- The setting aside or non-enforcement of a right. This may be done deliberately or it may happen by the operation of law. For example, if a tenant is in breach of a covenant in a lease and the landlord demands rent in spite of knowing of the breach, the landlord may be held to have waived the right to terminate the lease.
