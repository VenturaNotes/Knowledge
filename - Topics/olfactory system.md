## Synthesis
- The nasal cavity contains specialized receptors to detect odor molecules. These signals are sent to the olfactory bulbs which are processed and organized
- The olfactory information is then transmitted to the olfactory cortex where odor identification and perception occur
- The amygdala will link odros with memories and emotions, the hippocampus will from new memories associated with the specific ordor
- The hypothalamus and thalamus will receive olfactory signals regulating physialogical response

1. Odor molecules are detected by specialized receptors in the nasal cavity, which send signals to the olfactory bulbs at the base of the brain.
2. In the olfactory bulbs, the signals are processed and organized into specific patterns representing different odors.
3. From the olfactory bulbs, the processed olfactory information is transmitted to the olfactory cortex, including the piriform cortex and orbitofrontal cortex, where odor identification and perception occur.
4. The amygdala, located in the limbic system, processes the emotional and associative aspects of smell, linking odors with memories and emotions.
5. The hippocampus, also part of the limbic system, is involved in forming new memories, including memories associated with specific odors and their contexts.
6. The hypothalamus and thalamus receive olfactory signals and play roles in regulating physiological responses, such as hunger, thirst, and emotional states, based on olfactory information.
