	- Since $0x_1 + 0x_2 + 0x_3 + 0x_4 = 5$ is inconsistent, there is no solution, and therefore we have an [[inconsistent system]]

- If a knowledge base uses default assumptions or stores tentative conclusions then, as a result of inference, it may produce new facts that conflict with existing facts; it is then said to be inconsistent. This can occur in nonmonotonic reasoning and systems that use inheritance and must be either avoided or handled by special treatment if the integrity of the system is to be maintained. See DEFAULT RULES.
