- An autonomous vehicle can drive itself from point A to point B on autopilot. Autonomous vehicles use different in-vehicle technologies and sensors, such as adaptive cruise control, active steering, anti-lock braking systems, GPS navigation technology, lasers, and radar, to drive themselves around and follow road safety rules without any human interaction.
- There are many different stages of autonomous vehicles. For example, a level one autonomous vehicle is when the driver is assisted by an advanced driver assistance system (or ADAS). A level five autonomous vehicle is in total control without any help from a human driver.
