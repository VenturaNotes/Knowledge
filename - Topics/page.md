- The unit of interchange between memory and swapping device involved in a paging system. The number of words or bytes in a page is usually fixed for a given system and is almost invariably an exact power of 2 . The term [[page frame]] is used as an alternative name for page, but is more particularly used to apply to the copy of a page that is held on the swapping device.
