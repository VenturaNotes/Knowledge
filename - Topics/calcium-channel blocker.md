- (calcium antagonist) a drug that inhibits the influx of calcium ions into cardiac and smooth-muscle cells; it therefore reduces the strength of heart-muscle contraction, reduces conduction of impulses in the heart, and causes vasodilatation. Calcium-channel blockers, which include amlodipine, diltiazem, nicardipine, nifedipine, and verapamil, are used to treat angina and high blood pressure.
