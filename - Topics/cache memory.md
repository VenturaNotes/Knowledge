## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A [[personal computers|PC]] uses cache memory to help improve performance
- Level 1 cache is closest to the [[Central Processing Unit|CPU]]
- Cache memory is faster than RAM

## Source[^2]
- Cache memory is fast and expensive. It is categorized as "levels" that describe its closeness and accessibility to the [[microprocessors|microprocessor]]. There are three general cache levels
	- [[L1 Cache]]
	- [[L2 Cache]]
	- [[L3 Cache]]
- Cache memory operates between 10 to 100 times faster than RAM

## Source[^3]
- Cache memory is significantly faster than RAM
- Cache is considered the fastest type of computer memory, with access times much quicker than RAM due to its closer proximity to the CPU and smaller size, designed to store frequently accessed data for rapid retrieval
