- The right that the seller in a contract of sale has to resell the goods if the buyer does not pay the price as agreed. If the goods are perishable or the seller tells the buyer that the goods will be resold and the buyer still does not pay within a reasonable time, the seller may resell them and recover from the first buyer damages for any loss.
