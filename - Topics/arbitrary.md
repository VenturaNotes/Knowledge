- Otherwise unconstrained; for example, the phrase 'let x be an arbitrary real number' introduces x as a real number, selected without constraint. The arbitrariness of the choice may only be implicit $\textemdash$ let x $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$ $\textemdash$ encapsulates the same. The term is commonly used to describe the constant of integration. The term might also be combined with constraints such as 'let x be an arbitrary positive number', so that, aside from being positive, x could be considered as any positive number.
