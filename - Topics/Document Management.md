- Document management (DM) is a process used to execute data management tasks such as capturing, monitoring, and storing document data. It is useful for managing unstructured documents such as compound documents that contain various data structures. Usually, DM focuses on managing small groups of documents, but some businesses also rely on this process to manage multiple document types.
