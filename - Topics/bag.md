- (multiset) (1) An unordered collection of items where more than one instance of the same item is allowed. 
- (2) Any data structure representing a bag. Representations are similar to those used for sets. In a set, however, it is only necessary to represent the presence (or absence) of an element whereas in a bag it is also necessary to represent the number of times it occurs.
