- (echo de la pens√©e) a symptom of psychosis in which the patient has a hallucination of hearing aloud his or her own thoughts a short time after thinking them. Similar to the experience of thought echo is that of Gedankenlautwerden, in which the patients hear their own thoughts aloud at the time they think them. The latter was an original Schneiderian firstrank symptom, but has been left out of most translations of Schneider's work into English.
