- $n$. A neural measure of processing speed proposed in 1992 by the US psychologist Arthur R(obert) Jensen (1923-2012), obtained by dividing a person's head length (distance from the eye to the primary visual cortex) by the latency of an early component of the visual evoked potential, usually N70 or P100. It yields consistent though small correlations with psychometric measures of intelligence. NCV abbrev.
