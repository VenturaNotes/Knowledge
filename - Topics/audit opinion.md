- An opinion contained in an auditors' report. It expresses a view as to whether or not the financial statements audited have been prepared consistently using appropriate accounting policies, in accordance with relevant legislation, regulations, or applicable accounting standards. The opinion also has to state that there is adequate disclosure of information relevant to the proper understanding of the financial statements. If the auditors are satisfied on these points, and if any departure from legislation, regulations, or applicable accounting standards has been justified and adequately explained in the financial statements, an unqualified opinion will be given. If the scope of the auditors' examination has been limited, or the auditors disagree materially with the treatment or disclosure of a matter in the financial statements, or they do not comply with relevant accounting or other requirements, a qualified audit report or adverse opinion will be issued.
