- The inevitable flow of profit and shareholder value away from companies with outmoded business models and towards those better equipped to meet consumers' changing priorities. Typically, a company will go through a sequence of three phases: (i) value flows into the company as its business model proves better adapted to meeting consumer demand than those of its competitors; (ii) value stabilizes as a competitive equilibrium is reached; and (iii) value starts to flow out of the company as new forms of competition emerge.
