- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a defence mechanism involving a disavowal or failure consciously to acknowledge thoughts, feelings, desires, or aspects of reality that would be painful or unacceptable, as when a person with a terminal illness refuses to acknowledge the imminence of death. Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) introduced it into psychoanalysis in 1923 in an article on 'The Infantile Genital Organization' (Standard Edition, XIX, pp. 141-5), where he discusses it in relation to children denying that girls do not have penises although they can see that to be the case, and he developed the concept further in 1938/40 in his book An Outline of Psycho-Analysis (Standard Edition, XXIII, pp. 144-207, at pp. 203-4). Also called disavowal.
