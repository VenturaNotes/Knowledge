- The method of depreciating fixed assets by writing down a constant percentage of their remaining value each year. The remaining fraction is then written off when they are finally scrapped. With reducing balance depreciation the amount written down is reduced each year. In contrast, with straight-line depreciation an equal sum is written off each year for a predetermined number of years.
