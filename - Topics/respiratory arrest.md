- cessation of breathing, which $\textendash$ without treatment $\textendash$ will very quickly be followed by cardiac arrest. It may result from airway obstruction, brain or spinal injury, overdose of certain medications (e.g. opioids), disease of the muscles and/or nerves necessary for breathing, or severe lung disease or injury. Treatment must be prompt and include clearance of any blockage in the airway and ventilatory support, for example by MOUTH-TO-MOUTH RESUSCITATION.
