## Source[^3]
- $n$. One of the sleep-wake disorders in DSM-5, in which sudden and unpredictable lapses occur from wakefulness directly into REM sleep or from wakefulness into paralysis and atonia without loss of consciousness. It is characterized by frequent, involuntary episodes of refreshing sleep, together with either cataplexy (1) or recurrent intrusions of REM sleep during the transition between sleep and wakefulness, accompanied by hypnopompic images, hypnagogic images, or sleep paralysis. It is believed to be caused by a malfunction of the mechanisms in the subcoerulear nuclei or magnocellular nuclei responsible for REM atonia. Compare cataplexy (1), Kleine-Levin syndrome, hypersomnia, primary hypersomnia. \[From Greek narke numbness or torpor + lepsis a seizure, from lambanein to seize]
