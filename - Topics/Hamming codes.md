- A family of binary linear perfect error-correcting block codes.

  

They are capable of correcting any single error occurring in the block. Considered as $(n, k)$ block codes, Hamming codes have

  

$$

n=2^{m}-1, \quad k=n-m

$$

  

where $m$ characterizes the particular code. Where multiple-error-correcting abilities are required, Hamming codes may be generalized into Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes. The code was discovered by Richard Hamming in 1950.
