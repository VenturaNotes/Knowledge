- Any switching mechanism that is based on the through connection of a set of input lines selectively to a set of output lines. Space-division switches are implemented either by electromechanical or electronic means. Prior to the advent of time-division switching, all telephone and telegraph switching machines were implemented using a variety of space-division switching techniques, particularly Strowger (step-by-step) switches and crossbar switches.
