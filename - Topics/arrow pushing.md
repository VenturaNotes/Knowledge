- The use of arrows to notate the mechanism by which a reaction occurs, with the arrows indicating the movement of electric charge. Although arrow pushing is a simplification of the way that chemical reactions proceed, it has been found to be a useful device since it was introduced in the 1920s. Arrow pushing has also been used to describe chemical reactions in inorganic chemistry, particularly for electron-rich compounds.
