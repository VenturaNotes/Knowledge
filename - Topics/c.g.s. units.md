- A system of units based on the centimetre, gram, and second. Derived from the metric system, it was badly adapted to use with thermal quantities (based on the inconsistently defined calorie) and with electrical quantities (in which two systems, based respectively on unit permittivity and unit permeability of free space, were used). For scientific purposes c.g.s. units have now been replaced by SI units.
