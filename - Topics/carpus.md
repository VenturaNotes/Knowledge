## Source[^2]
- (pl. carpi) The wrist (or corresponding part of the forelimb) in terrestrial vertebrates, consisting of a number of small bones (carpals). The number of carpal bones varies with the species. The rabbit, for example, has two rows of carpals, the first (proximal) row containing three bones and the second (distal) row five. In humans there are also eight carpals. This large number of bones enables flexibility at the wrist joint, between the hand and forelimb. See also PENTADACTYL LIMB.
