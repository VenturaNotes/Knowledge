- Supply or demand shocks that are not uniform across the different regions of an economy. For example, one region may have a positive demand shock whereas another region has a negative shock. The regions may be separate parts of a single country, member states of a customs union, or different countries linked by trading relationships. If asymmetric shocks are frequent then it is difficult to maintain a common policy across the regions. See also OPTIMUM CURRENCY AREA.
