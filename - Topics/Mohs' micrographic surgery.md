- a surgical technique used for removing primarily high-risk nonmelanoma skin cancers, particularly basal cell carcinoma. The technique allows the surgeon to see beyond the visible tumor as the specimen is removed and the histology checked in stages. At each stage, if the tumor involves the margins, further tissue is resected until they are clear. There is an extremely high cure rate. \[F. E. Mohs (1910-2002), US surgeon]
