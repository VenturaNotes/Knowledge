- A period in the earth's history during which ice advanced towards the equator and a general lowering of temperatures occurred. The last major ice age, that of the Pleistocene epoch (sometimes known as the Ice Age), ended about 11,500 years ago. At least four major ice advances (glacials) occurred during the Pleistocene; these were separated by interglacials during which the ice retreated and temperatures rose. Since the end of the Pleistocene the earth has been in an interglacial phase, the Holocene epoch. It has been established that ice ages also occurred during the Precambrian over 600 million years ago (see CRYOGENIAN) and during the Permo-Carboniferous (about 250 million years ago).
