- The process in which particles in a colloid aggregate into larger clumps. Flocculation of clay particles in soil can be induced by the addition of calcium salts. Clay particles have an overall negative charge and therefore attract positive ions, such as $Ca^{2+}$, which form bridges holding the particles together. Flocculation is also often observed in cultures of bacterial and yeast cells.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. a reaction in which normally invisible material leaves solution to form a coarse suspension or precipitate as a result of a change in physical or chemical conditions. See also AGGLUTINATION.
