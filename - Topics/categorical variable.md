- A variable whose values are alphanumerical codes for different categories of observations or for different qualitative outcomes, which may or may not be ordered or ranked: for example, sex (male/female coded as M/F), preferred mode of transportation (cycle/bus/taxi coded as $1 / 2 / 3$ ), opinions from a survey (say, 'strongly opposed', 'opposed', 'neutral', 'support', 'strongly support' coded as $0 / 1 / 2 / 3 / 4$ ). When used in a regression they are recoded as a binary variable (often referred to as a dummy variable), with value 1 for a particular observation if it belongs to a given category and 0 if it does not.
