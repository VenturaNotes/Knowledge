- $n$. a malignant epithelial tumor arising from glandular structures, which are constituent parts of most organs of the body. The term is also applied to tumors showing a glandular growth pattern. These tumors may be subclassified according to the substances that they produce, for example mucinous and serous adenocarcinomas, or to the microscopic arrangement of their cells into patterns, for example papillary and follicular adenocarcinomas (see also CleAR-CELl CarcinOMA). They may be solid or cystic (cystadenocarcinomas).
