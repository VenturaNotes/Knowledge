- An approach to texturing the surface of an object by defining a spacefilling curve function that is only evaluated at the surface of the object. This avoids the conformance problems of texture mapping but results in a more limited range of textures. It is effective at simulating substances, such as marble, in which a grain actually occurs throughout and is unrelated to the shape of the object.
