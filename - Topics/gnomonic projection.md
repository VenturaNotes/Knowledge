- A mapping that projects a sphere onto a plane in such a way that all great circles of the sphere are represented by straight lines. This involves mapping points of the sphere onto a tangent plane by constructing rays from the centre of the sphere through all surface points, with the rays • finishing on the tangent plane. The construction means that less than half a sphere can be projected onto a plane of finite extent. Gnomonic projections are used in X-ray crystallography and other branches of physical science.
