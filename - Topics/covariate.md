- (covariable) $n$. (in statistics) a continuous variable that is not part of the main experimental manipulation but has a statistical relationship with the dependent variable. For example, in a study of weight gain, age may be a significant covariate. The inclusion of covariates increases the power of the statistical test and minimizes the effect of confounding variables.

- $n$. In analysis of variance (ANOVA), a variable that is measured in addition to a dependent variable and that represents a source of variance in the dependent variable not controlled for in the experiment. For example, in an experiment on reading comprehension, the covariate might be the research participants' or subjects' ages. In analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) such a covariate can be controlled for statistically. Also called a concomitant variable. \[From covariance]
