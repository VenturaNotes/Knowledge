- (covariable) $n$. (in statistics) a continuous variable that is not part of the main experimental manipulation but has a statistical relationship with the dependent variable. For example, in a study of weight gain, age may be a significant covariate. The inclusion of covariates increases the power of the statistical test and minimizes the effect of confounding variables.
