- A nontechnical synonym for both luminance and brightness. Luminance is the measured [[light intensity]] reflected or emitted by a surface in a given direction per unit of apparent area. Brightness is a psycho-physiological attribute of visual perception in which a source appears to emit or reflect more or less light.
## Source[^2]
- (1) (in atomic spectra) The strength or brightness of a spectral line. This depends on the probability of a transition between the two energy levels responsible for the line, the populations of the energy levels, and the number of atoms being observed. Similar considerations apply to the intensities of molecular spectroscopy. 
- (2) (in X-ray diffraction) The strength of a spot in a diffraction pattern. This depends on various factors, such as the diffraction angle and the temperature.
