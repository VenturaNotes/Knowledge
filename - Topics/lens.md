- (1) (in anatomy) the transparent crystalline structure situated behind the pupil of the eye and enclosed in a thin transparent capsule. It helps to refract incoming light and focus it onto the retina. See also ACCOMMODATION. 
- (2) (in optics) a piece of glass shaped to refract rays of light in a particular direction. Convex lenses converge the light, and concave lenses diverge it; they are worn to correct faulty eyesight. See also BIFOCAL LENS; CONTACT LENSES; TRIFOCAL LENSES.
## Source[^2]
- A transparent biconvex structure in the eyes or analogous organs of many animals, responsible for directing light onto light-sensitive cells. In vertebrates it is a flexible structure centred behind the iris and attached by suspensory ligaments to the ciliary body. In terrestrial species its main function is to focus images onto the retina. To focus on near objects, the circular muscles in the ciliary body contract and the lens becomes more convex; contraction of the radial muscles in the ciliary body flattens the lens for focusing on distant objects (see also ACCOMMODATION). The transparency and refractive properties of the lens are maintained by structural proteins called crystallins.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A transparent structure, with one or more convex or concave surfaces, that refracts light passing through it, causing either convergence or divergence of rays. The crystalline lens of the eye converges light rays on to the retina. See also dioptre, refraction. \[From Latin lens, lentis a lentil, alluding to the shape of a biconvex lens]
