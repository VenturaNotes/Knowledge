- (prostaglandin $\mathbf{I}_{2}$ ) An eicosanoid normally produced from prostaglandin $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ by endothelial cells lining the walls of blood vessels. It inhibits blood clotting by preventing the aggregation of platelets and causes widening of blood vessels (vasodilation). Hence, it is an antagonist of thromboxane $\mathrm{A}_{2}$. See prostaglandin.
