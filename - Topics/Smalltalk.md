- (Trademark) An object-oriented language, an object-oriented programming development environment, and a library of objects. Smalltalk was the first language to bring together all the features that characterize an object-oriented programming system. The language was developed at the Xerox Palo Alto Research Center, went through many versions during the 1970s (Smalltalk-74, Smalltalk-76, Smalltalk-78), and finally matured as Smalltalk-80. This was the first version to be made publicly available. However, although extremely influential on other languages, development techniques, and user interfaces, Smalltalk itself has never been widely used.
