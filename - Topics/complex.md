- (1) An organized structure made up of interconnected units. 
- (2) In psychoanalysis, an organized collection of ideas, emotions, impulses, and memories that share a common emotional tone and that have been excluded either partly or entirely from consciousness but continue to influence a person's thoughts, emotions, and behavior. This concept was introduced in 1895 by the Austrian physician Josef Breuer (1842-1925) in Studies on Hysteria (Standard Edition, II, at p. 231) and later adapted by Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) and Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961). The word complex is derived from complexion (2) in the transitional sense already established by the time of Shakespeare's Hamlet: 'So oft it chances in particular men, / That for some vicious mole of nature in them, / As in their birth, wherein they are not guilty / (Since nature cannot choose his origin), / By the o'ergrowth of some complexion, / Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason...' (I.iv. 23-8). See castration complex, complex indicator, Diana complex, Electra complex, father complex, inferiority complex, inverted Oedipus complex, Jocasta complex, mother complex, Oedipus complex, Orestes complex, particular complex, Phaedra complex, word-association test. 
- (3) In informal usage, an obsession or a phobia. Compare COMPLEXION (2).
