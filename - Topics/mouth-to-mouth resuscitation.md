- a form of artificial respiration (known informally as the 'kiss of life') performed on an individual who has stopped breathing. The nostrils are pinched shut, the head is placed in the head-tilt, chin-lift position, a seal is formed between the mouths of the casualty and rescuer, and air is blown firmly and steadily into the lungs for intervals of around three seconds. The small but definite infection risk with this technique can be avoided by using a pocket resuscitation mask. Mouth-tonose resuscitation is a similar technique in which the breaths are delivered through the casualty's nose.
