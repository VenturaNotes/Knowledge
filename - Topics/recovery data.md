- Data saved during execution of a system to enable error recovery. The data includes recovery points, and information allowing all data to be restored to the values that existed prior to the recovery point. Thus for data changed by operations following the recovery point, the value of the data prior to this change must be saved as recovery data at the time that the change is being made.
