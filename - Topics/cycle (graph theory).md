- A closed path with at least one edge. In a graph, a cycle is a sequence $v_0, e_1, v_1, ..., e_k, v_k (k \ge 1)$ of alternately vertices and edges (where $e_i$ is an edge joining $v_{i-1}$ and $v_i$), with all the edges different and all the vertices different, except that $v_0 = v_k$. See HAMILTONIAN GRAPH, TREE.
