- A financial firm that is willing to accept bills of exchange, that is, to guarantee that they will be paid on the due date. An accepting house uses its financial reputation to earn a fee for acceptance, and its specialized knowledge of financial markets to avoid taking too many risks of accepting bills where it is actually going to have to honour its guarantee. The principal London accepting houses form the Accepting Houses Committee.

- Formerly an institution specializing in accepting or guaranteeing bills of exchange. A service fee was charged for guaranteeing payment, enabling the bill to be discounted at preferential rates on the money market. The 1990s saw a decline in the use of bills of exchange and most of the accepting houses were absorbed by the merchant banks.
