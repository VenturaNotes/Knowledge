- A gift in which the donor retains some benefit from the asset given away. Examples include:
	- shares given away in which the donor continues to receive the dividends;
	- property given by a parent to a child, although the parent continues to live in the property, rent-free. HM Revenue and Customs has detailed rules to cover gifts with reservation to ensure that such gifts are not used as a means of avoiding tax.
