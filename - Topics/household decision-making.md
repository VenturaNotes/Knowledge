- A model of collective decision-making on consumption and labour supply inside a household in which a sharing rule specifies how the collective budget is distributed among the household members. Household decision-making is cooperative if all members pursue the maximization of a common objective function. It is non-cooperative if the members pursue personal objectives and engage in strategic interaction with other household members.
