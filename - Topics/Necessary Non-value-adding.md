- Necessary non-value-adding activities are those activities that are not creating value for the customer but are necessary under the current operating system, equipment, or business environment. These processes and activities are required for the business to operate, though they add no value from the customer's perspective. These processes include external and internal regulations or requirements that the business must follow.
