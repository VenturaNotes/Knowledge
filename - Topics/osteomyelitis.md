- $n$. inflammation of bone due to infection. Acute osteomyelitis occurs when bacteria enter the bone via the bloodstream and is more common in children. There is severe pain, tenderness, and redness over the involved bone, accompanied by general illness and high fever. Treatment is by antibiotics, and surgical drainage and curettage are often required. Chronic osteomyelitis may develop from partially treated acute osteomyelitis or after open fractures or surgery during which the bone is contaminated; tuberculosis is an occasional cause. Osteomyelitis can cause fracture and deformity of the bone.
