- (1) A measure of the diminution in value of a fixed asset due to wear and tear or obsolescence over an accounting period. A provision for depreciation can be computed by means of a number of generally accepted techniques, including the straight-line method, the diminishing-balance method, the sum-of-the-digits method, the production-unit method, and the revaluation method. The depreciation reduces the book value of the asset and is charged against income of an organization in the income statement or profit and loss account. Section 17 of the new Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and the Republic of Ireland deals with the subject of depreciation in the accounts. The relevant International Accounting Standard is IAS 16, Property, Plant and Equipment. 
- (2) A fall in the value of a currency with a floating exchange rate relative to other currencies. Depreciation can refer both to day-to-day movements and to long-term realignments in value. For currencies with a fixed exchange rate a devaluation or revaluation of currency is required to change the relative value. Compare APPRECIATION.
