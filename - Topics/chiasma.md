- n. (pl. chiasmata) (in genetics) the point at which homologous chromosomes remain in contact after they have started to separate in the first division of meiosis. Chiasmata occur from the end of prophase to anaphase and represent the point at which mutual exchange of genetic material takes place (see CROSSING OVER).
## Source[^2]
- (pl. chiasmata) The point at which paired homologous chromosomes remain in contact as they begin to separate during the first prophase of meiosis, forming a cross shape. A number of chiasmata can usually be identified and at these points crossing over occurs.
