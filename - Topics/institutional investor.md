- (institution) A large organization, such as an insurance company, unit trust, bank, trade union, or a pension fund of a large company, that has substantial sums of money to invest on a stock exchange, usually in the UK, in both gilts and equities. Institutions usually employ their own investment analysts and advisors; they are usually able to influence stock exchange sentiment more profoundly than private investors and their policies can often affect share prices. Because institutions can build up significant holdings in companies, they can also influence company policy, usually by making their opinions known at shareholders' meetings, especially during takeover-bid negotiations.
