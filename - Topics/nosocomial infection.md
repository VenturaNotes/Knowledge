- (hospital infection) an infection that originates in a hospital. It may develop in a hospitalized patient or a member of the hospital staff, or it may be acquired in hospital but only develops after discharge. Such infections include those caused by fungi and opportunist bacteria. They are aggravated by factors favoring the spread of organisms (cross-contamination), such as insufficient hand washing among medical staff, and by reduced resistance of individual patients, as well as by antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria (see Clostridium; Enterococcus; MRSA).
