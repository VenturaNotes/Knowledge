- a test for the presence of sugar in urine or other liquids. A few drops of the test solution are added to Benedict's solution, prepared from sodium or potassium citrate, sodium carbonate, and copper sulphate. The mixture is boiled and shaken for about two minutes, then left to cool. The presence of up to $2 \%$ glucose is indicated by the formation of a reddish, yellowish, or greenish precipitate, the highest levels corresponding to the red coloration, the lowest (about $0.05 \%$ ) to the green. \[S. R. Benedict (1884-1936), US surgeon]
## Source[^2]
- A biochemical test to detect reducing sugars in solution, devised by the US chemist S. R. Benedict (1884-1936). Benedict's reagent$\textemdash$a mixture of copper(II) sulphate and a filtered mixture of hydrated sodium citrate and hydrated sodium carbonate$\textemdash$is added to the test solution and boiled. A high concentration of reducing sugars induces the formation of a red precipitate; a lower concentration produces a yellow precipitate. Benedict's test is a more sensitive alternative to Fehling's test.
