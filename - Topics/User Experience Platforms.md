- User experience platforms (UXP) are a type of software. UXPs are used in web portal programs that can be manipulated via user interaction with the main interface of the program. This means that they allow users to work with applications or other programs on the internet. These programs operate at the enterprise level, meaning that they have multiple components. UXPs have largely been replaced by digital experience platforms (DXPs), which are an upgraded form of UXPs.
