- $n$. A variable, the value of which is determined by one or more independent variables and/or other mediating variables and that in turn affects the value of a dependent variable not directly affected by the independent variables. For example, the independent variable wealth has a measurable effect on the dependent variable life expectancy inasmuch as wealthy people tend to live longer than poor people, and the effect is indirect, one mediating variable that plays a part being medical care: wealthy people tend to receive more and better medical care than poor people, and this in turn increases life expectancy. The chain of causation is thus wealth $\rightarrow$ medical care $\rightarrow$ life expectancy, and medical care is a mediating variable. Often confused with intervening variable. \[From Latin mediare, mediatum, to be in the middle, from medius the middle]
