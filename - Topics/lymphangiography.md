- (lymphography) n. X-ray examination of the lymphatic vessels and lymph nodes after a contrast medium has been injected into them (see ANGIOGRAPHY). Lymphatic vessels in the upper part of the foot are dissected and cannulated after injecting methylene blue into the web space to identify them. Then a viscous contrast medium (Lipiodol) is injected into them at a very slow rate. Its main uses are in the investigation of the extent and spread of cancer of the lymphatic system, the investigation of lymphoedema, and postoperative collection from lymphatic damage. Newer techniques involve injection of contrast medium directly into the lymph nodes (intranodal lymphangiography). Alternatively, the lymphatic system can be imaged using a gamma camera following the injection of a radioactive tracer. This examination has now largely been replaced by other cross-sectional imaging techniques.
