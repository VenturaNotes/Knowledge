- (market testing) A procedure for launching a new product in a restricted geographical area to test consumers' reactions. If the product is unsuccessful, the company will have minimized its costs and can make the necessary changes before a wider launch. Test marketing is typically undertaken in large towns or in areas served by a particular commercial television company. Test marketing has the disadvantage that competitors learn about the new product before its full launch. See also NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.
