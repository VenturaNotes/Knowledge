- A weighted average of prices or quantities, where the weights used are the quantities or the prices of the base period. Let $p_{i j}$ and $q_{i j}$ be the prices and quantities of $N$ goods, $i=1,2, \ldots N$, in period $j$. If $t$ is the latest period and 0 the base period, the base-weighted or Laspeyres price index is given by$$P_{B}=\left(\Sigma_{i} p_{i t} q_{i0}\right) /\left(\Sigma_{i} p_{i 0} q_{i0}\right)$$and the base-weighted or Laspeyres quantity index is given by$$Q_{B}=\left(\Sigma_{i} p_{i0} q_{it}\right) /\left(\Sigma_{i} p_{i0} q_{i0}\right)$$
