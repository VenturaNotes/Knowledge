- Describing a vascular plant that produces two types of spores, a smaller microspore and a larger megaspore. The microspore develops into a male gametophyte (microgametophyte) stage that produces sperm, while the megaspore develops into a female gametophyte (megagametophyte) that produces eggs. All seed plants exhibit heterospory, and their haploid microspores and megaspores are produced by microsporangia and megasporangia, respectively, inside the parent plant's reproductive organs$\textemdash$cones in the case of gymnosperms and flowers in the case of angiosperms. Compare HOMOSPOROUS. See also ALTERNATION OF GENERATIONS.
