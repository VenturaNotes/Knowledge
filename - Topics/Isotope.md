## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- $n$. any one of the different forms of an element, possessing the same number of protons (positively charged particles) in the nucleus, and thus the same atomic number, but different numbers of neutrons. Isotopes therefore have different atomic weights. Radioactive isotopes decay into other isotopes or elements, emitting alpha, beta, or gamma radiation. Some radioactive isotopes may be produced artificially by bombarding elements with neutrons. These are known as nuclides and are used extensively in radiotherapy for the treatment of cancer.
## Source[^2]
- One of two or more atoms of the same element that have the same number of protons in their nucleus but different numbers of neutrons. Hydrogen (1 proton, no neutrons), deuterium ( 1 proton, 1 neutron), and tritium ( 1 proton, 2 neutrons) are isotopes of hydrogen. Most elements in nature consist of a mixture of isotopes.
