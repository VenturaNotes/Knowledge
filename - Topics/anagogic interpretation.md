- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a mode of interpretation of dreams, myths, and other symbolic representations in order to reveal their higher allegorical or spiritual meaning. It is considered to be the opposite of ordinary analytic interpretation, which on the contrary reduces such material to its basic and often sexual content. Carl Gustav Jung (1875-1961) incorporated anagogic interpretation into his analytical psychology, but Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) rejected it as merely a reversion to pre-analytic notions ('Dreams and Telepathy', 1922, Standard Edition, XVIII, pp. 197-220, at p. 216). \[From Greek anagoge a lifting up, from ana up + agein to lead]
