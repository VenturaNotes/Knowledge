- (1) damage to the phrenic nerve as a result of trauma. 
- (2) formerly, surgical crushing of a portion of the phrenic nerve. This paralyses the diaphragm on the side operated upon, which is then pushed upwards by the abdominal contents, thus pressing on the lung and partially collapsing it. This operation was formerly often combined with pneumoperitoneum in the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis but is now obsolete.
