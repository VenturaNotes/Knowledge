- Magnetic-ink character recognition (MICR) is a process used by certain printers with which automatic readers scan numbers at the bottom of a check or deposit slip. This scan allows for the check or deposit slip to be automatically sorted. MICR can dramatically increase the efficiency of banks and other financial institutions.
