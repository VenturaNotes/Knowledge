- A post which an employer intends to fill if a suitable applicant appears. The total number of job vacancies in an economy at a given time is difficult to measure, as there is no one standard method of advertising or filling them. Job information is circulated by official and private employment agencies, public advertisement, and word of mouth among present and past employees.
