- (FTD) a relatively rare neurodegenerative disease characterized by progressive loss of neurons predominantly involving the frontal and/or temporal lobes. First described by Arnold Pick in 1892, it was originally called Pick's disease. Common symptoms include significant changes in social and personal behaviour, abulia, blunting of emotions, and language deficits. Compared with Alzheimer's disease, a younger population is affected (age 55-65) and more cases have a genetic cause.
