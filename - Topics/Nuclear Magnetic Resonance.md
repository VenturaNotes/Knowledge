- (NMR) the absorption and emission of high-frequency radio waves by the nuclei of certain elements when placed in a strong magnetic field. The strongest signal is obtained from hydrogen atoms, which are abundant in the water and organic molecules in the body. In clinical use for magnetic resonance imaging, the signal is highly dependent on the concentration and mobility of water molecules within each tissue. NMR has important applications in noninvasive diagnostic techniques. See also MAGNETIC RESONANCE SPECTROSCOPY.

- (NMR) The absorption of electromagnetic radiation (radio waves) by certain atomic nuclei placed in a strong and stable magnetic field. This results in a change of orientation of the nuclei, which respond to the magnetic field like miniature bar magnets. The main application of NMR is in a form of spectroscopy (NMR spectroscopy) used for chemical and biochemical analysis and structure determination. There are two methods of NMR spectroscopy. In continuous wave (CW) NMR, the sample is subjected to a strong magnetic field, which can be varied in a controlled way. As the field changes, absorption of radiation occurs at certain points; this produces oscillations in the field, which can be detected. Fourier transform (FT) NMR uses a fixed magnetic field and the sample is subjected to a high-intensity pulse of radiation covering a range of frequencies. The signal produced is analyzed mathematically to give the NMR spectrum. The ${ }^{1} \mathrm{H}$ nucleus is the one commonly studied; other biochemically useful nuclei are ${ }^{31} \mathrm{P},{ }^{13} \mathrm{C},{ }^{14} \mathrm{~N}$, and ${ }^{19} \mathrm{~F}$, although these have lower natural abundance than hydrogen and produce weaker signals. The spectrum produced is characteristic of the molecule absorbing the radiation. NMR has been exploited as the basis of magnetic resonance imaging.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A phenomenon that occurs when the nuclei of molecules resonate during exposure to high-frequency (usually radiowave) radiation in a strong magnetic field. In strong magnetic fields, certain protons (subatomic particles) spin like tops, and pulses of radiation cause them to tilt momentarily and then to regain their original orientations, giving off detectable amounts of energy as they do so. Different molecules absorb different frequencies of the radiation as the protons tilt, depending on the magnetic properties of their nuclei, and from the precise frequencies of radiation that they absorb, information concerning the bonds between their atoms can be deduced, thus enabling the structure of the material to be determined. Magnetic resonance imaging or MRI, one of the techniques of brain imaging, is based on this phenomenon. NMR abbrev.
