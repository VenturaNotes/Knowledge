- A quality assurance standard applied to processes and procedures, rather than to products. The standard specifies processes capable of producing outputs that will satisfy the requirements of customers for high and consistent quality; these are formalized, documented, and inspected. Subsequent periodic inspections are then made to ensure that the certified procedures are being adhered to. At its inception, a BS 5750 accreditation was an order-winning criterion providing a competitive advantage. Now, in many industries, it is impossible to trade without it. Compare ISO 9000.
