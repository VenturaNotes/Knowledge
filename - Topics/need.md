- $n$. what is required rather than simply desired or wanted. In allocating limited health-care resources, clinical need is often defined as the capacity to benefit from an intervention and assessed on a utilitarian basis (see QUALITY OF LIFE). Other conceptions of need, such as the state of requiring rescue from a life-threatening situation, are based on deontology.
