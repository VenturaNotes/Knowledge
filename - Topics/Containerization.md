- The use of large rectangular containers for the shipment of goods. Goods are packed into the containers at the factory or loading depot and transported by road in these containers to the port of shipment, where they are loaded direct onto the ship without unpacking. At the port of destination they can again be transported by road to the final user. It is usual for such shipments to be covered by a container bill of lading (combined-transport bill of lading).
