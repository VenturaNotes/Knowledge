- an infection in the bone around the apex of a tooth. An acute abscess is extremely painful and if left untreated may cause swelling of the jaw and sometimes the face. A chronic abscess may be completely asymptomatic. An abscess invariably results from damage to and infection of the pulp of the tooth. Treatment is drainage and root canal treatment or extraction of the tooth; antibiotics may give temporary relief. If left untreated, the infection may spread, resulting in severe complications and even mortality.
