- $n$. (in interventional radiology) a technique in which metallic coils are placed inside a blood vessel to occlude it or divert the blood away from an aneurysm. In the case of acute bleeding, blocking the blood with coils is life-saving. In brain aneurysms, the bulging portion of the blood vessel is weak and can rupture, causing bleeding into the brain. By coiling the aneurysm the blood is diverted away from the weak portion. This has largely replaced aneurysm clipping by neurosurgeons, which involves opening the skull to gain access to the aneurysm.
