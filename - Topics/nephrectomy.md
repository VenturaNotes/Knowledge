- $n$. surgical removal of a kidney. When performed for cancer of the kidney, the entire organ is removed together with its surrounding fat and the adjacent adrenal gland (radical nephrectomy). When performed for a benign condition the procedure is called a simple nephrectomy. Removal of either the upper or lower pole of the kidney is termed partial nephrectomy. The operation can be performed by laparoscopy.
