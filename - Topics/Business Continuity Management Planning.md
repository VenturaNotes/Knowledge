- Business continuity is the ability of a business to continue in the face of obstacles. Business continuity management planning, or BCMP, means using personnel or tools to have a plan in place to ensure business continuity. Aspects of this include risk assessment and contingency plans. Disaster recovery plans may also form part of BCMP. Lists of vendors, IT support systems and tools, and partners should also feed into BCMP.
