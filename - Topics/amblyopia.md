- $n$. Impaired vision without any apparent damage to the eye or the optic nerve. Compare amaurosis, anopia. \[From Greek amblys dull + ops an eye + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
## Source[^2]
- $n$. poor sight, not due to any detectable disease of the eyeball or visual system, known colloquially as lazy eye. In practice this strict definition is not always obeyed. For example, in toxic amblyopia, caused by tobacco, alcohol, certain other drugs, and vitamin deficiency, there is a disorder of the optic nerve. The commonest type is amblyopia ex anopsia, in which factors such as squint (see STRABISMUS), cataract, and other abnormalities of the optics of the eye (see REFRACTION) impair its normal use in early childhood by preventing the formation of a clear image on the retina. This in turn leads to a cortical visual impairment.
