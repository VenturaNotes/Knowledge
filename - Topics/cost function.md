- Definitions of [[Costs]]
	- It is important to differentiate between [[accounting cost]] and [[economic cost]]
	- Accountants
		- out-of-pocket expenses, historical costs, depreciation, and other bookkeeping entries
	- Economists focus more on [[opportunity cost]]

- (1) The minimum cost of producing a given output level expressed as a function of input prices. Assume there are two inputs, capital, $K$, and labour, $L$, with cost-per-unit of $r$ and $w$ respectively. Let the production function relating inputs to output, $Y$, be given by $Y=f(K, L)$. The cost function is obtained from the solution to the minimization problem$$\min r k+w L \text { subject to } f(K, L) \geq Y$$Solving the minimization provides the factor demand functions $K=$ $K(r, w, Y)$ and $L=L(r, w, Y)$. Substituting these back into the objective gives the cost function$$C(r, w, Y) \equiv r K(r, w, Y)+w L(r, w, Y)$$
- (2) The minimum cost for a consumer of achieving a given utility level. See also EXPENDITURE FUNCTION.
## Source[^4]
- A formula or equation that represents the way in which particular costs behave when plotted on a graph. For example, the most common cost function represents the total cost as the sum of the fixed costs and the variable costs in the equation $y=a+b x$, where $y$ is the total cost, $a$ is the total fixed cost, $b$ is the variable cost per unit of production or sales, and $x$ is the number of units produced or sold.
