- An electronic logic gate whose output is logic 1 (true) only when any one of its inputs is logic 1 and all the others are logic 0 (false), otherwise the output is logic 0 . It therefore implements the logical exclusive-OR operation and has the same truth table; it is thus sometimes known as a nonequivalence gate. Like the exclusive-NOR gate it can be used as a simple digital comparator. The diagram shows the circuit symbol and truth table for a two-input gate.
