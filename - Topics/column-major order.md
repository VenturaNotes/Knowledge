- One way of mapping the elements of a two-dimensional array onto a vector, e.g. for representation in memory. If a two-dimensional array, $A$, with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is mapped in column-major order onto a vector $\boldsymbol{b}$ with $m \times n$ elements then$$\begin{aligned}& a_{i j}=b_{k} \\& \text {where } k=m(j-1)+i\end{aligned}$$See also ROW-MAJOR ORDER.
