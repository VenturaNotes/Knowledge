- $n$. Differential expression (3) of a gene depending on whether it is inherited from the mother or father, a phenomenon that occurs in only a small number (about 100) of the genes in the human genome. In paternal imprinting, an allele inherited from the father is not expressed in the offspring; in maternal imprinting, an allele inherited from the mother is not expressed in the offspring. Also called molecular imprinting or simply imprinting. Genetic imprinting occurs in the testes or ovary early in the formation of a sperm or egg. \[So called because the gene is imprinted with information about the parent from which it came]
