- A systematic survey of productive enterprises, normally carried out by an official body with powers to compel firms to reply to questionnaires. Information is typically collected from enterprises on topics such as the nature of their products, the quantity and types of inputs used, the number and types of employees, and value added. The results of censuses of production can be used to draw up input-output tables for the economy.
