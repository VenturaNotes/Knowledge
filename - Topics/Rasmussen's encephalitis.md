- a focal encephalitis, found most commonly in children, that results in continual focal seizures (see EPILEPSY). The underlying cause is unknown but it may be due to a viral infection or an autoimmune process. Patients who are unresponsive to medical (antiepileptic) therapy may undergo surgery of the abnormal brain to try and control the seizures. \[G. L. Rasmussen (20th century), US anatomist]
