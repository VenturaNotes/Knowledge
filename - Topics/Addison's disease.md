- a syndrome resulting from inadequate secretion of corticosteroid hormones due to the progressive destruction of the adrenal cortex. It is characterized by progressive deterioration with hypotension and collapse due to severe dehydration, salt loss, and hypoglycaemia; dark pigmentation of the skin may occur. Formerly tuberculosis was a common cause, but the condition is now more likely to be due to autoimmune destruction of the adrenal cortices (see autoimMUNE DISEASE). Treatment is with hydrocortisone and fludrocortisone. \[T. Addison]
