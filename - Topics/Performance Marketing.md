- Performance marketing refers to a type of online marketing and advertising technique. Specifically, it refers to marketing where a business or other entity will pay for its marketing. This payment occurs on the basis of the success of that marketing campaign. Pay-per-click (PPC) or pay-per-impression (PPI) are two common forms of performance marketing. These are commonly used for internet or social media marketing campaigns.
