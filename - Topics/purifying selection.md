- (negative selection) The process whereby harmful genetic variants (alleles) are eliminated from a population. For example, a new mutation that reduces the fitness of an individual is less likely to be transmitted to successive generations and the mutant trait will be quickly lost. Similarly, a change in environmental conditions may reduce the fitness of an existing trait and subject it to negative selection. Compare POSITIVE SELECTION. See also NATURAL SELECTION; NEUTRAL THEORY OF MOLECULAR EVOLUTION.
