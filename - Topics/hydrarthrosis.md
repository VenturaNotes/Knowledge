- $n$. swelling at a joint caused by excessive synovial fluid. The condition usually involves the knees and may be recurrent. Often no cause is apparent; in some cases rheumatoid arthritis develops later. Excess synovial fluid may also occur with other forms of inflammatory arthritis, such as psoriatic and reactive arthritis, as well as with osteoarthritis.
