- URI is an acronym for uniform resource identifier. A URI is a unique identifier for an abstract or physical resource that is, oftentimes, connected to the internet. URIs help web users alike distinguish one resource, such as electronic documents, webpages, and information sources, from another. URIs execute internet protocols to allow users to interact with said resources. The set of characters that URIs consist of identify the scheme name and file path of its corresponding resource. The most common form of a URI is a URL, which is commonly known as a web address.
