- A form of engineering that addresses systems at a high level of abstraction prior to determining the particular engineering disciplines that will be appropriate in satisfying the system's requirements. This is a very wide topic, ranging much wider than computer-based systems; it includes, for example, the study of social systems, economic systems, and ecological systems. See also ENGINEERING OF COMPUTER-BASED SYSTEMS.
