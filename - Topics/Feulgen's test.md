- A histochemical test in which the distribution of DNA in the chromosomes of dividing cell nuclei can be observed. It was devised by the German chemist R. Feulgen (1884–1955). A tissue section is first treated with dilute hydrochloric acid to remove the purine bases of the DNA, thus exposing the aldehyde groups of the sugar deoxyribose. The section is then immersed in Schiff’s reagent, which combines with the aldehyde groups to form a magenta-colored compound.
