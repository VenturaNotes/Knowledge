- rupture of the membranes in cases of a cord presentation. It is an obstetric emergency: there is a severe risk of cord compression and spasm causing fetal asphyxia (see HYPOXIC-ISCHAEMIC ENCEPHALOPATHY). Delivery must occur as soon as possible and the presenting part displaced away from the cord.
