- $n$. reduced or defective absorption of various nutrients in the small bowel. It commonly affects the absorption of fatty acids (causing steatorrhoea, bloating, and flatulence), fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K), water-soluble vitamins ( $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ and folate), electrolytes (such as calcium and potassium), iron, and amino acids. Symptoms include weight loss, diarrhoea, failure to thrive, weakness and lethargy (due to anaemia), paraesthesia, swelling (oedema), and a propensity to bleeding. The commonest causes are coeliac disease, Crohn's disease, pancreatitis, cystic fibrosis, blind loop syndrome, chronic infection (e.g. giardiasis), and previous surgery.
