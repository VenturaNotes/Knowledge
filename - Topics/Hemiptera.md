- An order of exopterygote insects comprising the true bugs. Hemipterans typically have oval flattened bodies with two pairs of wings, which are folded back across the abdomen at rest. The forewings are hardened, either at their bases only (in the suborder Heteroptera) or uniformly (in the suborder Homoptera). The mouthparts are modified for piercing and sucking, with long slender stylets forming a double tube. Many bugs feed on plant sap and are serious agricultural pests, including aphids, leaf-hoppers, scale insects, mealy bugs, etc. Others are carnivorous, and the order contains many aquatic species, such as the water boatmen, which have legs adapted for swimming and the exchange of respiratory gases.
