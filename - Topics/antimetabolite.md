## Source [^1]
- $n$. any one of a group of drugs that interfere with the normal metabolic processes within cells by combining with the enzymes responsible for them. Some drugs used in the treatment of cancer, e.g. cytarabine fluorouracil, methotrexate, and mercaptopurine, are antimetabolites that prevent cell growth by interfering with enzyme reactions essential for nucleic acid synthesis. For example, fluorouracil inhibits the enzyme thymidylate synthetase. Side-effects of antimetabolites can include blood cell disorders and digestive disturbances. See also CHEMOTHERAPY; CYTOTOXIC DRUG.
