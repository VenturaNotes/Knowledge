- $n$. reproduction in which an organism develops from an unfertilized ovum. It is common in plants and occurs in some lower animals (e.g. aphids).
## Source[^2]
- The development of an organism from an unfertilized egg. This occurs sporadically in many plants (e.g. dandelions and hawkweeds) and arthropods, and in some fishes, amphibians, and reptiles. In some species it is the main and sometimes only method of reproduction. For example, in some species of aphid, males are absent or very rare. The eggs formed by the females contain the full (diploid) number of chromosomes and are genetically identical. Variation is consequently very limited in species that reproduce parthenogenetically. See ARRHENOTOKY; THELYTOKY.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A form of reproduction in some insects from a female gamete without fertilization by a male gamete. Distinguished in careful usage from asexual reproduction, in which gametes are not formed. Compare SEXUAL REPRODUCTION. parthenogenetic or parthenogenic adj. \[From Greek parthenos a virgin + genesis birth]
