- A functional region of a protein that spans the phospholipid bilayer of a biological membrane, such as the plasma membrane of a cell. Integral membrane proteins typically comprise two or more such domains, alternating with intracellular and extracellular domains arranged on either side of the membrane. Amino acids of the transmembrane domains interact with the fatty acyl groups of the membrane phospholipids, thereby anchoring the protein in the membrane.
