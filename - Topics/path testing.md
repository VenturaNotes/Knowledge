- A test strategy equivalent to finding all possible paths through the control-flow diagram of a program. Testing each path at least once is a typical test strategy, but for much real software complete path test coverage would require an impracticably large test run/time. Path testing almost always requires more test runs than either branch testing or statement testing.
