- Suppose that the particle P is moving in the plane, in a circle with center at the origin O and radius $r_0$. Let ($r_0, \theta$) be the polar coordinates of $P$. At an elementary level, the angular acceleration may be defined to be $\ddot \theta$, where a dot denotes differentiation with respect to time.
- At a more advanced level, the angular acceleration $\alpha$ of the particle P is the vector defined by $\alpha = \dot \upomega$, where $\upomega$ is the angular velocity. Let $i$ and $j$ be unit vectors in the directions of the positive x- and y-axes and let $k = i \times j$. Then, in the case above of a particle moving along a circular path, $\upomega = \dot \theta k$ and $\alpha = \ddot \theta k$. If $r, v$ and $a$ are the position vector, velocity and acceleration of P, then $$\begin{align}&r = r_0e_r, v = \dot r = r_0\dot \theta e_\theta, \\ &a=\ddot r = -r_0\dot \theta^2e_r + r_0\ddot \theta e_\theta \end{align}$$where $e_r = icos \theta ++ j sin \theta$ and $e_\theta = - i sin \theta + j cos \theta$ (see circular motion). Using the fact that $v = \upomega \times r$, it follows that the acceleration $a = \alpha \times r + \omega \times (\omega \times r)$.
