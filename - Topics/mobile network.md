## Synthesis
- A wireless telecommunications system that allows mobile devices like phones and tablets to make calls, send messages, and access the internet by connecting to nearby towers that transmit radio signals, enabling users to stay connected while moving around a geographic area

	- #question what are the towers that transmit radio signals called?
## Source [^1]
- A cellular network or mobile network is a [[radio network]] distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver, known as a cell site or base station
	- #question What are cells?
	- #question what is a cell site or base station? What is a transceiver?
- In a cellular network, each cell uses a different set of frequencies from neighboring cells, to avoid interference and provide guaranteed [[bandwidth]] within each cell
	- #question How does each cell know which frequencies to use?
	- #question What kind of frequencies are being used?
	- #question Are the neighboring cells all created by the same provider like Verizon, Xfinity, or T-Mobile?
	- #question What does interference between frequencies look like?
## Source[^2]
- A cellular network or mobile network is a [[Telnet|telecommunications network]] where the link to and from end nodes is wireless and the network is distributed over land areas called cells, each served by at least one fixed-location transceiver
	- #question what is a telecommunications network? Is it like a hierarchy where cellular network and mobile network are children of it?
