- $n$. A technique of psychotherapy based on mindfulness and acceptance in which clients are encouraged to acquiesce in or assent to the reality of situations in which they find themselves, including those that are unpleasant or uncomfortable, without attempting to change them, to protest against them, or to exit from them. Originally called comprehensive distancing, the technique was developed in the late 1980s by the US psychologists Steven C. Hayes (born 1948), Kelly G. Wilson (born 1954), and Kirk D. Strosahl (born 1950), and practitioners consider it an advanced form of cognitive behavior therapy. Hayes claimed controversially in 2006 that acceptance implies that 'happiness isn't normal'. The technique is frequently referred to by its initials, pronounced like the word act. Compare dialectical Behavior THERAPY. ACT abbrev.
