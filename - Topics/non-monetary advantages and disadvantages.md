- Those aspects of an employment that are not connected with its financial remuneration. They include the employees' subjective opinion of their working environment, the stimulation or boredom of the work itself, the companionship or isolation experienced in their place of work, the distance travelled to reach work, etc. These aspects of an employment, together with the salary, bonuses, commission, and fringe benefits, make employees decide either to stay in their present jobs or seek another.
