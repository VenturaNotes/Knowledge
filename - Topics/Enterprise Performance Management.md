- EPM refers to the process in which planning, reporting, and business intelligence (BI) software analyzes performance measures such as KPIs and ROIs to provide business insights. Through this software, businesses can do everything from planning and budgeting to forecasting and finalizing finances. An EPM can be used across departments even though the responsibilities of each department may be different. EPM eliminates the need for multiple and different platforms to conduct processes like planning, reporting and budgeting.
