- $n$. a cell produced as an intermediate stage in the formation of spermatozoa (see SPERMATOGENESIS). Spermatocytes develop from spermatogonia in the walls of the seminiferous tubules of the testis; they are known as either primary or secondary spermatocytes according to whether they are undergoing the first or second division of meiosis.
## Source[^2]
- A diploid cell in the testis that divides by meiosis to give rise to four spermatids (see SPERMATOGENESIS). A primary spermatocyte develops from a spermatogonium. Two secondary spermatocytes result from the first meiotic division of a primary spermatocyte; each of these produces two spermatids after the second meiotic division.
