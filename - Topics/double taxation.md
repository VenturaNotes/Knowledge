- Taxation that falls on the same source of income in more than one country. Taxation is normally levied on a person's worldwide income in the country of residence but, in addition, most countries also levy a charge on income that arises within that country whether it is from interest or a business. As a result a large number of treaties (double-taxation agreements) have been concluded between countries to ensure that their own residents are not doubly taxed. The agreements also attempt to cover fiscal evasion.
- As a result there are several different kinds of relief from double taxation available: (1) relief by agreement, providing for exemption, in whole or in part, of certain categories of income; (2) credit agreement, in which tax charged in one country is allowed as a credit in the other; (3) deduction agreement, in which the overseas income is reduced by the foreign tax paid on it; (4) if there is no agreement the UK tax authorities will allow the foreign tax paid as a credit up to the amount of the corresponding UK liability.

- The collection of taxes on the same flow by two tax instruments. Double taxation of income by two countries can occur when an economic asset earns income in one country but is owned in another. If countries tax both the profits of firms operating in their territories, and the incomes of their residents, double taxation will occur unless there is an agreement between the two countries to prevent it. Double taxation is thought to be undesirable as it hinders international factor mobility. The double taxation of saving refers to the taxation of labour income and the taxation of the interest income that results from saving part of the labour income. The terminology is often used, but it is arguable whether this constitutes double taxation as defined since the two flows are distinct in this case.
