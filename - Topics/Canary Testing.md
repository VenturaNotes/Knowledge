- Canary testing is a software testing model that tests new software features and functionalities by rolling out code changes to a small group of end users in a live environment. Canary testing usually serves as a precursor to a larger software release or update. Typically, these user groups are unaware that the software changes have been implemented. This software testing model allows software development teams to test out new software features and functionalities with minimal user impact, as these changes only impact a small cohort of the applicationâ€™s end users. Due to the small-scale, incremental nature of canary testing, developers can easily reverse the changes made to the software if the new code proves to be erroneous.
