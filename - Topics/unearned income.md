- Income not derived from trades, professions or vocations, or from the emoluments of office. In the UK it was formerly taxed more heavily than earned income, through the imposition of an investment-income surcharge. Earned and unearned income are now taxed at essentially the same rates, with some minor differences in the treatment of income from savings and company dividends.
