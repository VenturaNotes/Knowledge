- (1) n. a wound made accidentally or deliberately by a sharp object or instrument. Puncture wounds need careful treatment as a small entry hole in the skin can disguise serious injury in an underlying organ or tissue. Punctures are also performed for diagnostic purposes using a hollow needle, in order to withdraw a sample of tissue or fluid for examination; needle punctures are used especially for obtaining tissue samples for the liver, bone marrow, or breast. See also lumbar puncture. 
- (2) vb. to pierce a tissue with a sharp instrument or needle. A gall bladder that is tense with bile may need to be punctured while being removed, to make it more amenable to manipulation.
