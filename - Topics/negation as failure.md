- A rule of inference that assumes a fact is false when all possible proofs of the fact being true have failed. This is exactly equivalent to negation when the closed-world assumption holds-if some information is not contained within the system as a truth, then it is assumed false. Negation as failure is an important feature of the language Prolog.
