## Source [^1]
- The view that economic life should be organized for the benefit of consumers, rather than producers. Because consumers are individuals while producers are mostly organized in firms, and consumers spread their purchases over a much wider variety of goods and services than most firms produce, consumers are mostly less well informed and less organized than producers. Consumerism takes the view that where the interests of consumers and producers clash, the law should take the side of consumer protection against firms' profits or their workers' job security.

- An organized movement of citizens and government agencies to improve the rights and power of buyers in relation to sellers.
