## Source[^2]
- A market for immediate delivery (in some cases a short time is allowed for delivery). Spot markets exist for goods, securities, and currencies. They are distinguished from forward and futures markets, in which delivery of the items traded is due at an agreed future date. The terminology arose from the practice of unskilled labourers gathering at a meeting point, or 'spot', early in the morning for possible selection by employers needing additional labour immediately.
