- a life-threatening bacterial infection of the layer of fascia beneath the skin, usually by Streptococcus Type A. Symptoms appear rapidly after initial infection; they include a rash with blistering and discoloration of the skin, pain and inflammation of lymph nodes, fever, drowsiness, diarrhoea, and vomiting. Tissue necrosis and toxin production can result in shock and possible multi-organ failure. Necrotizing fasciitis is often associated with vascular disease, especially in diabetics, and the elderly and those who have recently undergone surgery are also vulnerable to the infection, which requires prompt treatment with intravenous antibiotics and excision of the involved tissue.
