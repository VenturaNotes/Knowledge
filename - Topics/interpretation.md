- The process of attaching meanings to the expressions of a formal language-or the meanings so attached. Without interpretation, expressions are purely formal entities, neutral with respect to meaning; this neutrality allows one to separate syntactic from semantic concerns, and to consider different interpretations for one formal language. The following are examples: propositional logic interpretations attach Boolean values to primitive symbols; predicate logic interpretations involve relations or functions over some underlying set; algebras similarly attach sets and functions to the symbols of a signature. Interpretations are made in the semantics of programming languages. An interpretation can give completely arbitrary meanings to primitive symbols. By contrast, a model must also satisfy certain logical sentences.

- n. 
- (1) The act or process of explaining, elucidating, or clarifying, or the product of such activity. 
- (2) In psychoanalysis, a process of decoding the latent meaning of a patient's speech and actions, thereby revealing unconscious (1) conflicts, exposing the underlying wishes that maintain them, and allowing the patient to gain insight (3). Sigmund Freud (1856-1939) first described it in 1900 in relation to dreams in his book The Interpretation of Dreams (Standard Edition, IV-V), where the latent content of dreams is derived from its manifest content through interpretation. See also active analysis, OVERINTERPRETATION, PASSIVE ANALYSIS, REDUCTIVE INTERPRETATION, RESISTANCE, THIRD EAR, WORKING THROUGH. Compare PSYCHOANALYTIC CONSTRUCTION. 
- (3) In logic, the allocation of specific meanings to the terms of a purely abstract or formal system. interpret $v b$. interpretational $a d j$.
