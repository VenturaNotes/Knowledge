- A stationary distribution for a Markov chain is a probability vector $\bf p$ such that $\bf{pM}=\bf{p}$, where $\bf M$ is the transition matrix. An irreducible chain has a stationary distribution if and only if all the states are recurrent and have finite mean recurrence time. In this case, the stationary distribution is unique and $p_i = \frac{1}{m_i},$ where $m_i$ is the mean recurrence time of the $i$th state.
