- $n$. the tissue that forms the wall of the blastocyst. At implantation it forms two layers, an inner cellular layer (cytotrophoblast), which does not invade maternal tissue and forms the outer surface of the chorion; and an outer syncytial layer (syncytiotrophoblast, or plasmoditrophoblast), which erodes the maternal tissue and forms the chorionic villi of the placenta. See also GESTATIONAL TROPHOBLASTIC DISEASE.

- The layer of epithelial cells that forms the outer wall of a blastocyst (see blastula). It embeds the blastocyst into the wall of the uterus (see implantation) and contributes to the chorion.
