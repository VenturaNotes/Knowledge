- (algebraic closure) A field is algebraically closed if every root of every polynomial with coefficients in the field is in the field. The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra shows that $\mathbb{C}$ is algebraically closed. The algebraic closure of a field is the smallest extension of the field which is algebraically closed. So, the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{R}$ is $\mathbb{C}$ and the algebraic closure of $\mathbb{Q}$ is the field of algebraic numbers.
