- $n$. A controversial term for a sexual preference that is experienced as ego-dystonic. Hence ego-dystonic bisexuality, ego-dystonic homosexuality. In 1973 the American Psychiatric Association removed the mental disorder of homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, resulting in a furious reaction from dissident psychiatrists, who accused the leadership of the Association of capitulation to gay liberationists, and after an acrimonious debate and a referendum of the entire membership of the Association, the third edition (DSM-III) included homosexuality only under ego-dystonic homosexuality. Also called sexual orientation disturbance (SOD).
