## Synthesis
- A type of story or task that is specifically time-boxed research or exploratory work. Primary purpose is to gain knowledge or resolve uncertainty about a technical approach, a design, or a solution before committing to full development. Might help answer specific questions like
	- "Can we integrate with this new API?"
	- "Which database technology would be best for this specific requirement?"
		- #question What kind of database technologies are there?
	- "How complex would it be to implement this [[user interface]]?"
	- "What's the performance impact of using this new library?"
		- #question How could you test for performance impacts
- The output of a spike is information, proof-of-concept, design document, or better understanding of a problem and potential solutions. Then this will help the team more accurately estimate and plan the actual development work for related feature
	- #question Is "development work" correct like a noun adjunct?
- Spike is often attributed to [[Extreme programming]] and is used to spike a solution through a difficult technical problem
## Source [^1]
- A type of racemose inflorescence in which stalkless flowers arise from an undivided floral axis, as in plantain and Orchis. In the family Gramineae (Poaceae; sedges and grasses) the flowers are grouped in clusters called spikelets (see illustration), which may be arranged to form a compound spike (as in wheat). See Glume; LEMMA.
