- A type of racemose inflorescence in which stalkless flowers arise from an undivided floral axis, as in plantain and Orchis. In the family Gramineae (Poaceae; sedges and grasses) the flowers are grouped in clusters called spikelets (see illustration), which may be arranged to form a compound spike (as in wheat). See Glume; LEMMA.
