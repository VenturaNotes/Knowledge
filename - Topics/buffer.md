- In networking, a buffer is a temporary storage device that holds data while it's being transferred between devices or systems
- Buffers used to compensate for differences in data flow rates, or when data arrives faster than it can be processed

## Source[^2]
- (1) A temporary memory for data, normally used to accommodate the difference in the rate at which two devices can handle data during a transfer. The buffer may be built into a peripheral device, such as a printer or disk drive, or may be part of the system's main memory. See buffering. 
- (2) Any circuit or device that is put between two others to smooth changes in rate or level or allow asynchronous operation. For example, line drivers can be used to isolate (or buffer) two sets of data lines.
