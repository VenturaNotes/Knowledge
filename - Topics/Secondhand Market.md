- As the cost of mobile devices and computers continues to rise, secondhand markets have become popular. In a secondhand market, previously used cell phones, tablets, computers, and other devices are sold for less than the retail price. Secondhand markets typically purchase these devices from their previous owners for a fraction of the original cost. The owner may be upgrading to a newer model or the device requires repairs or upgrades. Such markets allow the device owner to recoup some of the money spent, along with providing the market operator a chance to repair or refurbish the item before selling it for a profit.
