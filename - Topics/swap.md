- A means by which a borrower can exchange the type of funds most easily raised for the type of funds required, usually through the intermediary of a bank. For example, a UK company may find it easy to raise a sterling loan when they really want to borrow euros; a German company may have exactly the opposite problem. A swap will enable them to exchange the currency they possess for the currency they need. This is called a currency swap. The other common type of swap is an interest-rate swap, in which borrowers exchange fixed- for floating-interest rates. The essence of a swap is that the parties exchange the net cash flows of different types of borrowing instruments on an over-the-counter market. See also BASIS SWAP; CROSSCURRENCY INTEREST-RATE SWAP.

- A financial derivative in which two counter-parties agree to exchange one stream of cash flows for another stream. In an interest rate swap a flow of payments at a fixed interest rate is swapped for a flow at a variable interest rate. A currency swap involves the initial exchange of principal denominated in two different currencies, payments of interest in the currency received over the lifetime of the swap, and a final re-exchange of principal. See also DERIVATIVE.
