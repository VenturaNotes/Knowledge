## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- $n$. disintegration of the nuclei of certain elements, leading to the emission of energy in the form of alpha, beta, or gamma rays. As particles are emitted the elements 'decay' into other elements. Naturally occurring radioactive elements include radium and uranium. There are many artificially produced isotopes, including iodine-131 and cobalt-60 used in radiotherapy; technetium-99m is used in nuclear medicine. See RADIOISOTOPE. â€”radioactive $a d j$.
## Source[^2]
- The spontaneous disintegration of certain atomic nuclei accompanied by the emission of alpha-particles (helium nuclei), beta-particles (electrons or positrons), or gamma radiation (short-wavelength electromagnetic waves). Natural radioactivity is the result of the spontaneous disintegration of naturally occurring radioisotopes. The rate of disintegration is uninfluenced by chemical changes or any normal changes in their environment. However, radioactivity can be induced in many nuclides by bombarding them with neutrons or other particles. See also RADIATION UNITS.
