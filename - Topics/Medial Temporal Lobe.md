- Resides in lower middle portion of each side of brain
	- Located deep in the temporal lobes
- Plays a critical role in memory systems particularly in declarative memory and spatial memory
- Function in the memory system is highly significant, particularly in the formation and consolidation of new memories.
- Plays a pivotal role in various aspects of memory formation, consolidation, spatial cognition, associative learning, recognition memory, and semantic memory
- The role of the medial temporal lobe in memory formation is believed to be temporary. Once memories are well-established in other brain regions, they become less reliant on the medial temporal lobe for retrieval.
- crucial for consolidating new experiences into long-lasting memories
- Key hub for integrating and organizing new experiences and knowledge into the brain's memory systems
- Connects to other areas of the brain involved in memory such as the amygdala and prefrontal cortex allowing for integration of various aspects of memory
