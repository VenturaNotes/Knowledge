- (Ritter's disease) a potentially serious condition of young infants (and occasionally seen in adults) in which the skin becomes reddened and tender and then peels off, giving the appearance of a scald. The area of skin loss may be quite extensive and is usually centred on the armpits and groin. The underlying cause is an infection by certain bacteria of the genus Staphylococcus. It is contagious and may occur in clusters. Treatment is by antibiotics (usually intravenous), but careful nursing is essential to prevent skin damage. Admission to hospital is mandatory for small children.
