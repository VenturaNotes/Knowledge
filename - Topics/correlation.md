- A measure of a tendency for two or more random variables to be associated. The formula for $r$, the sample [[correlation coefficient]] between two variables $x$ and $y$, is $$\frac{\sum(x_1-\overline x)(y_i - \overline y)}{\sqrt{|\sum(x_i-\overline x)^2\sum(y_i-\overline y)^2}}$$which varies between -1 and +1. Negative values or $r$ indicate that y tends to decrease as x increases, while positive values indicate that $x$ and $y$ increase or decrease together. If the value of $r$ is zero, then $x$ and $y$ are uncorrelated
- Rank correlation measures the correlation between the ranks (or order numbers) of the variables, i.e. between the positions when the numbers are arranged in increasing order of magnitude.
- Correlation does not imply causation. Variables may be correlated accidentally, or because of joint association with other unmeasured agencies such as a general upward trend with time. If the relationship is not linear the correlation coefficient may be misleading.
