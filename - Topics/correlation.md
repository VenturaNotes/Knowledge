- A measure of a tendency for two or more random variables to be associated. The formula for $r$, the sample [[correlation coefficient]] between two variables $x$ and $y$, is $$\frac{\sum(x_1-\overline x)(y_i - \overline y)}{\sqrt{|\sum(x_i-\overline x)^2\sum(y_i-\overline y)^2}}$$which varies between -1 and +1. Negative values or $r$ indicate that y tends to decrease as x increases, while positive values indicate that $x$ and $y$ increase or decrease together. If the value of $r$ is zero, then $x$ and $y$ are uncorrelated
- [[Rank correlation]] measures the correlation between the ranks (or order numbers) of the variables, i.e. between the positions when the numbers are arranged in increasing order of magnitude.
- Correlation does not imply causation. Variables may be correlated accidentally, or because of joint association with other unmeasured agencies such as a general upward trend with time. If the relationship is not linear the correlation coefficient may be misleading.

- $n$. (in statistics) the degree of linear relationship between two or more variables. Pairs of observations can be plotted as a series of points on a graph. The correlation coefficient measures the extent to which the points on the resulting scatter diagram form a straight line. The correlation coefficient varies within the range of +1 (where an increase of one variable is associated with a corresponding increase in the other, and vice versa) to -1 (where an increase of one variable is associated with a corresponding decrease of the other); a coefficient of 0 indicates no linear relationship between the two variables. The statistical technique known as multivariate analysis can be used to investigate the relationships between several variables.
