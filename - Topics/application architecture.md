- Application architecture is the discipline for designing applications. It provides designers with a roadmap to create a successful app. This architecture outlines everything needed to build and deploy an app, including software components, interfaces, internal and external systems, and all the interactions between them. Application architecture styles such as service-oriented architecture (SOA) provide best practices that improve design decisions, patterns, and solutions.
