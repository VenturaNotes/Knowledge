- (growth-hormone-release inhibiting hormone) a hormone produced by the hypothalamus and some extraneural tissues, including the gastrointestinal tract and pancreas (see ISLETS OF LANGERHANS), that acts to inhibit the secretion of many hormones. For example, in the pituitary gland it inhibits the release of growth hormone (somatotrophin) and in the pancreas it suppresses secretion of insulin and glucagon. Somatostatin analogues are used to treat acromegaly (caused by overproduction of growth hormone) and to relieve the symptoms caused by hormone-secreting neuroendocrine tumors, including carcinoid tumors. They include lanreotide (also licensed for the treatment of thyroid tumors) and octreotide (also used to reduce vomiting in palliative care and to treat oesophageal varices); gastrointestinal upsets (e.g. nausea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, diarrhoea) are the most common side-effects.
## Source[^2]
- (growth hormone inhibiting hormone; GHIH) A hormone, secreted by the hypothalamus, that inhibits the release of growth hormone from the anterior pituitary gland (see RELEASE-INHIBITING HORMONE). The secretion of somatostatin is stimulated by various factors, including very high blood glucose levels, which result from the effect that growth hormone has on glucose metabolism. It is also produced by the D cells of the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas, where it can inhibit the release of glucagon and insulin.
