- An order issued by a court to enforce a judgment; it is addressed to a court officer instructing that officer to carry out an act, such as collecting money or seizing property. A writ of delivery is a writ of execution directing the High Court Enforcement Officer to seize goods and deliver them to the plaintiff or to obtain their value in money, according to an agreed assessment. If the writ does not offer the defendant the option to retain the goods by paying the assessed value, the writ is a writ of specific delivery.
