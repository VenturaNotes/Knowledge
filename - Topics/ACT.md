- abbrev. (pronounced act-star). Adaptive Control of Thought, an advanced version of a network model of information processing first put forward in 1976 by the Canadian-born US psychologist John R(obert) Anderson (born 1947). It includes two distinct long-term memory stores: (a) a declarative memory, modelled by a semantic network of interconnected concepts represented by nodes (2), containing declarative knowledge, the active part of the declarative memory system constituting working memory; and (b) a procedural memory, modelled by a production system, containing the system's procedural knowledge.
