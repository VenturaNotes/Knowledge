- In general, a device that recovers the modulation (data, speech, video, etc.) separating the modulating signal from the carrier (or carriers). In modems, it is the device that receives analogue signals as input and produces digital data as output. Demodulators use the inverse of the methods used by modulators, which encode data as analogue signals. See also MODULATION, MODEM.
