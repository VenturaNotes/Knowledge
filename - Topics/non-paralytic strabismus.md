- n. A hereditary form of strabismus characterized by an inability to use both eyes together, so that objects or images have to be fixated with one eye or the other. A person with alternating strabismus tends to alternate fixation between the eyes, the eyes taking turns of approximately a second each as long as the object is fixated, whereas a person with monocular or non-alternating strabismus fixates continuously with one eye, the other eye often becoming blind as a result of disuse. See also AMBLYOPIA EX ANOPSIA. Compare PARALYTIC STRABISMUS.
