- (PID) an acute or chronic condition in which the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries are infected. It is usually the result of infection ascending from the vagina; Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae have been identified as causative agents. PID may be associated with lower abdominal pain, irregular vaginal bleeding, and vaginal discharge. An acute infection may respond to treatment with antibiotics, but in the chronic state, when pelvic adhesions have developed, surgical removal of the diseased tissue may be necessary. Blocking of the Fallopian tubes is a common result of pelvic inflammatory disease; this can lead to ectopic pregnancy or infertility.
