- A symmetric matrix where the absolute value of any diagonal entry is not less than the sum of the absolute values of the rest of the row that entry appears in, i.e. $|a_{ii}| \ge \Sigma_{j \ne i}|a_{ij}|$. If the matrix contains complex elements, the same relationship applies with the absolute value function replaced by the modulus function
