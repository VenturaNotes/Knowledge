- For an odd prime $p$ and integer $a$, the Legendre symbol $(a|p)$ is defined to be $-1$ if $x^2 \equiv a \text{ mod } p$ has no solution, 0 if $p$ divides $a$, 1 if $x^2 \equiv a \text{ mod } p$ has a solution and $p$ does not divide $a$. Thus, the number of solutions mod $p$ to $x^2 \equiv a$ is $1 + (a|p)$. See QUADRATIC RECIPROCITY.
