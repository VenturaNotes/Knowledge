- Security information and event management refers to a branch of cybersecurity and protection that involves the need to watch a security event unfold in real time. This enables immediate, early detection of any security attack or data breach. As part of this process, information about these attacks is collected and stored for later investigation, patching, and preventative measures. SIEM can help identify the perpetrator of an attack and hold them accountable.
## Source[^2]
- SIEM typically refers to a software system that aids computer security. Instead of merely logging alerts, this technology generates in-depth reports and analysis to aid threat detection, compliance, incident management, and more. SIEM monitors all aspects of an organizationâ€™s IT structure, including apps and websites.
