- A small-to-midsize enterprise (SME) is a business that typically has fewer than 250 employees and less than $1 billion in annual revenue. SMEs tend to be more flexible and agile than large corporations. They also have fewer overhead expenses and greater ability to adapt to changing market conditions or other challenges that arise over time.
