- $n$. A form of auditory masking in which the test stimulus is presented to one ear and the masking stimulus to the other, the masking being interpreted as central because it cannot be ascribed to any peripheral process occurring in the ear but must arise centrally at or beyond the point where information from the two ears is combined. Also, an analogous form of visual masking usually called dichoptic masking that leads to similar conclusions. Compare Binaural beat.
