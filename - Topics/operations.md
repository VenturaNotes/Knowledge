- A set of activities concerned with transforming resource inputs into desired outputs, i.e. goods or services. Every purposeful organization has desired outputs and, as every output requires inputs of some sort, all purposeful organizations are involved in operations. Traditionally, the word has been used to refer exclusively to manufacturing processes, but it applies equally to the service sector and to non-profit-making organizations. In some organizations it is possible to identify a single coherent sub-system as performing the operations function. In others, responsibility for various elements may be split between different linked departments.
