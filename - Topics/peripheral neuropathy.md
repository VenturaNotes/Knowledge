- (polyneuropathy, peripheral neuritis) any of a group of disorders affecting the sensory and/or motor nerves in the peripheral nervous system. They tend to start distally, in the fingers and toes, and progress proximally. Symptoms include pins and needles, stabbing pains and a numbness on the sensory side, and weakness of the muscles. The most common causes of peripheral neuropathy are diabetes, alcohol, certain drugs, and such infections as HIV; genetic causes of peripheral neuropathy include amyloidosis and Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. The diagnosis may be established by neurophysiological tests, blood tests, and occasionally a nerve biopsy.
