- A group of people living together in shared accommodation and with common domestic expenses. A household usually but not always contains people who are related or cohabiting. Although individuals are the recipients of incomes, the household is the unit through which much consumption expenditure is decided. The Living Costs and Food Survey is a source of detailed information on the composition of household expenditure in the UK, and the Consumer Expenditure Survey a source for the US.
