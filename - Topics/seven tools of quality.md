- A quality-control schema in which seven types of diagram or chart are used to diagnose problems in any given system and to facilitate their resolution. It was developed by the Japanese management professor Kaoru Ishikawa as part of his philosophy of total quality management. It is claimed that the use of these simple, easily interpreted charts will allow quality control to be standardized throughout a business. The diagrams are: check sheets to collect real-time data; control charts; flow charts; histograms or bar charts; Pareto charts; scatter diagrams; and Ishikawa's own cause-effect diagram, which can be used to narrow down the possible causes of a problem.
