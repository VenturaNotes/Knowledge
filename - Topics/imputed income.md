- Income attributed to the owner of an asset which could have been rented out to somebody else to produce a cash income, where the owner in fact uses the asset themselves. An example of an imputed income is the rental value of owner-occupied housing: this is included in both the national income and consumption in the UK national income accounts. The argument for this is that without it national income would appear to fall whenever a rented house was purchased by its tenant. In some countries, though not the UK, the imputed income from owner-occupied housing is subject to income tax.
