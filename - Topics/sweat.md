- $n$. the watery fluid secreted by the sweat glands. Its principal constituents in solution are sodium chloride and urea. The secretion of sweat is a means of excreting nitrogenous waste; at the same time it has a role in controlling the temperature of the body $\textendash$ the evaporation of sweat from the surface of the skin has a cooling effect. Therefore an increase in body temperature causes an increase in sweating. Other factors that increase the secretion of sweat include pain, nausea, nervousness, and drugs (diaphoretics). Sweating is reduced by colds, diarrhoea, and certain drugs. Anatomical name: sudor.
## Source[^2]
- The salty fluid secreted by the sweat glands onto the surface of the skin. In humans it consists of about $99 \%$ water plus minerals (chiefly sodium and chloride ions), lactate, urea, uric acid, and ammonia, among small amounts of other substances. In mammals with sparse body hair the evaporation of sweat from the skin surface and consequent cooling effect is a major mechanism of thermoregulation.
