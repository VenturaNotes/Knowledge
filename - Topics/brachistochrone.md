- Suppose that $A$ and $B$ are points in a vertical plane, where $B$ is lower than $A$ but not vertically below $A$. Imagine a particle starting from rest at $A$ and travelling along a curve from $A$ to $B$ under the force of gravity. The curve with the property that the particle reaches $B$ as soon as possible is called the brachistochrone (from the Greek for 'shortest time'). The straight line from $A$ to $B$ does not give the shortest time. The required curve is a cycloid, vertical at $A$ and horizontal at $B$. The problem was posed in 1696 by Jean Bernoulli, and his solution, together with others by Newton, Leibniz and Jacques Bernoulli, was published the following year.
