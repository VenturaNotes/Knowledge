- A procure-to-pay (or purchase-to-pay) system is an integrated digital solution that supports procurementâ€”the practice of obtaining goods and services for business purposes. These systems simplify buying products and services and uploading ready-to-pay files into an accounts payable system. A procure-to-pay platform typically uses a service called "scan and capture," in addition to a supplier portal and/or a multi-enterprise network to manage invoices electronically and collect funds from clients. Organizations using this tool can process invoices that don't match or return faulty or unsold goods to suppliers.
