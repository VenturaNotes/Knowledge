- L-band is a satellite frequency range that falls between 1 to 2 GHz. It is used for a number of different purposes, but is most commonly used in GPS applications, telecommunications, aircraft surveillance, and digital video broadcasting. This is because the signal is able to travel through a variety of environments, including fog and heavily wooded areas.
