- (in ecology) The absolute number of individuals of a species in a given sample, community, or area of habitat. An abundant species is one that is locally numerous or occurs at high densities. Relative abundance is the proportion of individuals of any one species in relation to the total number of individuals of all species found. For example, suppose a pond contains 100 individuals belonging to four species of amphibian, A, B, C, and D; and the numbers of individuals for each are as follows: $\mathrm{A}=40 ; \mathrm{B}=30 ; \mathrm{C}=25 ; \mathrm{D}=5$. The relative abundances are: $\mathrm{A}=0.4 ; \mathrm{B}=0.3 ; \mathrm{C}=0.25$; and $\mathrm{D}=0.05$. The distribution of relative abundance values is described by species evenness; when these values are similar across a range of species, the community is more diverse (see BiodivERSITY).
