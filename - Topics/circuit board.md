- A single rigid board of insulating material on which an electric circuit has been built. It often has an edge connector at one end for making all the connections to other circuits so that the board may be plugged into a piece of equipment. Circuit boards come in a variety of sizes, some of which are standardized. The term [[circuit card]] is often used synonymously but is sometimes considered smaller than a circuit board. See also BACKPLANE, PRINTED CIRCUIT.
