- $n$. the physiological process by which the internal systems of the body (e.g. blood pressure, body temperature, acid-base balance) are maintained at equilibrium, despite variations in the external conditions. $\textemdash$ homeostatic adj.
## Source[^2]
- The regulation by an organism of the chemical composition of its body fluids and other aspects of its internal environment so that physiological processes can proceed at optimum rates. It involves monitoring changes in the external and internal environment by means of receptors and adjusting the physiological variables, such as the composition of body fluids, accordingly; excretion and osmoregulation are important in this process. Examples of homeostatic regulation are the maintenance of the acid-base balance and body temperature (see HOMOIOTHERMY; POIKILOTHERMY). Many variables are continually adjusted so that they remain around a given value or set point.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. The maintenance of equilibrium in any physiological, psychological, or social process by an automatic feedback mechanism compensating for disrupting changes. The word was coined by the US physiologist Walter Bradford Cannon (1871-1945) and became popular after the publication in 1932 of his book The Wisdom of the Body, in which the process is described in relation to the automatic maintenance of body temperature and components of blood, including water, salt, sugar, proteins, fat, calcium, oxygen, hydrogen ions$\textemdash$the list could be extended in the light of subsequent discoveries. See also APPESTAT, CLOSED-LOOP CONTROL, CYBERNETICS, FEEDBACK, PRINCIPLE OF CONSTANCY, THERMOREGULATION, SET POINT. homeostatic adj. \[From Greek homos same + stasis a standing]
