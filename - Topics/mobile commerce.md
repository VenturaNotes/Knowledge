- (m-commerce) Selling goods or services to customers over the Internet via their smartphones and tablet computers. Transactions are carried out using websites, particularly those tailored for handheld devices, or through applications (apps) that enable purchases from particular firms. Increasingly, mobile devices can also be used as a direct means of payment. For instance, transport or event tickets can be bought in this way without using a bank card.
