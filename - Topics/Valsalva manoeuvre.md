- an attempt by a person to exhale forcibly with a closed glottis while pinching the nose and keeping the mouth closed, so that no air exits through the mouth or nose, as when straining during a bowel movement or lifting a heavy weight. The resulting increased pressure transplants air through the Eustachian tube, thus equalizing the negative pressure in the middle ear. This manoeuvre can often relieve the ear pain associated with flying, which is usually associated with changes in pressure particularly occurring during takeoff and landing. \[A. M. Valsalva (1666-1723), Italian anatomist]
