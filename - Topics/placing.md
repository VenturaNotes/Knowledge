Placings can be used either as a means of flotation or to raise additional capital for a listed company (see also PREEMPTION RIGHTS; RIGHTS ISSUE). Placings are usually the cheapest way of raising capital and they also allow the directors of a company to influence the selection of shareholders. Placings of private companies (private placings) are often carried out without the intermediary of a stockbroker. A public placing is the placing of a public company.
