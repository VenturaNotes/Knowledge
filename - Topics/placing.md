- The selling of shares in a company to a selected group of individuals or institutions. Placings can be used either as a means of flotation or to raise additional capital for a listed company (see also PREEMPTION RIGHTS; RIGHTS ISSUE). Placings are usually the cheapest way of raising capital and they also allow the directors of a company to influence the selection of shareholders. Placings of private companies (private placings) are often carried out without the intermediary of a stockbroker. A public placing is the placing of a public company. In the USA a placing is called a placement. Compare INTRODUCTION; OFFER FOR SALE.

- Sale of shares by a UK company to selected individuals or institutions approached directly, rather than by an issue open to the general public. A placing may be preferred on grounds of lower costs, or because it gives the company a chance to choose its new shareholders.
