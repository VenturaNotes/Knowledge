- In the computer industry the terms of the software license are usually printed clearly on a sticky seal or are readable on the box, which is covered with a 'shrink-wrap' film. Within the box are the disks and manuals and there is usually a notice that says that if you need to return the software the packages must be unopened with the shrink-wrap intact and that software with broken seals will not be refunded. The contention is that, once you have broken the seal or stripped off the shrink-wrap, you have entered into a license agreement upon the terms stated in the license. Legally this is very doubtful under English law although there are amendments to the laws of certain US states that make this an enforceable contract under their local laws.
