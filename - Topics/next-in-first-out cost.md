- (NIFO cost) A method of valuing units of raw material or finished goods issued from stock by using the next unit price at which a consignment will be received for pricing the issues. It is effectively using replacement cost as a stock valuation method, which is not normally acceptable as a stock valuation system in the UK when computing profits for taxation purposes. Compare FIRST-IN-FIRST-OUT COST; LAST-IN-FIRST-OUT COST.
