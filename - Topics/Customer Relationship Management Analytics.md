- In a healthcare context, customer relationship management (CRM) analytics collect, organize, and analyze data to help healthcare companies solve business problems. They include reporting tools, real-time metrics, portals, and dashboards. They pull data from multiple sources so departments across a healthcare system (billing, marketing, sales, customer service, etc.) can make better data-driven decisions.
