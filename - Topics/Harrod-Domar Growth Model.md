## Synthesis
- Focuses on the role of capital accumulation in economic growth.
## Source[^1]
- A growth model, named after its originators, which considers the consequences of fixed capital-labour ratios and saving propensities. In this model, the labour force, measured in efficiency units to allow for technical progress, grows at an exogenously fixed natural growth rate, $n$. There is a fixed capital-output ratio, $v$, and a fixed propensity to save, $s$. If national income is $Y$, savings are $s Y$. The desired capital stock is $v Y$, and if this grows at a constant proportional rate $g$, desired investment is $g v Y$. Ex ante savings and investment are equal only if $s Y=g v Y$, or $g=s / v$. The only growth rate which makes this possible is $w$ $=s / v$, the warranted growth rate. If $w=n$, growth is possible with a constant percentage of the labour force employed. If $w<n$, that is, the warranted growth rate is less than the natural rate, equilibrium growth of national income involves steadily increasing unemployment. If $w>n$, equilibrium growth becomes impossible once full employment is reached, and the resulting slowdown in growth produces a slump. The Harrod-Domar growth model is a special case of the Solow growth model, in which $v$ adjusts to accommodate any combination of $s$ and $n$.
