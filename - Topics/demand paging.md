- A method of dealing with a situation in which a process requires access to a page of memory that has been written to backing store. Some systems attempt to forecast the pattern of demand for pages; other systems rely on demand paging in which no attempt is made to forecast the pattern of behavior, but pages are transferred from backing store into main memory on demand as required by the individual process.
