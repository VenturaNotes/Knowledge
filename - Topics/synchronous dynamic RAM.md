- A type of DRAM (see RAM) the timing of whose functions is controlled by the system clock. This makes possible such speed-enhancing techniques as pipeline processing that rely on coordinated timings between RAM and other components. It is currently (2014) the predominant type of RAM used in microcomputers, in its double data-rate (DDR) form.
