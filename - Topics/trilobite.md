- An extinct marine arthropod belonging to the class Trilobita (some 4000 species), fossils of which are found in deposits dating from the Precambrian to the Permian period (590-250 million years ago). They disappeared during the later Permian mass extinction. Trilobites were typically small ( $1\text{-}7 \mathrm{~cm}$ long); the oval flattened body comprised a head (covered by a semicircular dorsal shield) and a thorax and abdomen, which were protected by overlapping dorsal plates with a raised central part and flattened lateral portions, presenting a three-lobed appearance. The head bore a pair of antenna-like appendages and a pair of compound eyes; nearly all body segments bore a pair of Y-shaped (biramous) appendages$\textemdash$one branch for locomotion and the other fringed for respiratory exchange. Trilobites were bottom-dwelling scavengers.
