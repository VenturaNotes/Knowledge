- A person living or based in the UK to whom one of the following applies for a given tax year:
	- the person is present in the UK for 183 days or more during that year;
	- the person pays substantial visits to the UK, averaging 90 days or more for four or more consecutive years;
	- the person has accommodation available for use in the UK and one visit is made during the year. This does not apply if the taxpayer is working abroad full-time nor to individuals who come to the UK for a temporary purpose only.
- A UK resident or resident company is subject to UK tax on income or capital gains arising anywhere in the world (unless this is disapplied by a double taxation agreement). From 15 March 1988 companies incorporated in the UK are regarded as resident in the UK for corporation-tax purposes, irrespective of where the management and control of the company is exercised. HM Revenue and Customs has an International Manual that provides more details. Compare DOMICILE.
