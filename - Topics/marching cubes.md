- An algorithm that creates a triangle representation of an isosurface from a volumetric dataset. The basis of this algorithm is a sequential tessellation of the boundary voxels by small triangles. The algorithm was originally presented by Lorensen and Cline. A refinement, called marching tetrahedra, deals with some of the ambiguous cases not covered by marching cubes.
