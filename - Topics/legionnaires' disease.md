- an infection of the lungs caused by the bacterium Legionella pneumophila, named after an outbreak at the American Legion convention in Pennsylvania in 1976. Legionella organisms are widely found in water; outbreaks of the disease have been associated with defective central heating, air conditioning, and other ventilating systems. Symptoms appear after an incubation period of 2-10 days: malaise and muscle pain are succeeded by a fever, dry cough, chest pain, and breathlessness. X-ray of the lungs shows patchy consolidation. Erythromycin provides the most effective therapy.
