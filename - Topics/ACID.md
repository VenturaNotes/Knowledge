- These are the essential qualities of a transaction in database processing: either all or none of the subtasks composing the transaction must be performed (atomicity); the database satisfy all its constraints both at the beginning and at the end of the transaction (consistency); no other database user can access the data being manipulated by the transaction while it is an intermediate, and possibly inconsistent, state (isolation); and, once completed, the effect of the transaction will not be reversed, for example by a system crash and subsequent recovery (durability). See also BASE, CAP THEOREM
## Source[^2]
- In transaction processing, ACID (atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability) is an acronym and mnemonic device used to refer to the four essential properties a transaction should possess to ensure the integrity and reliability of the data involved in the transaction.
## Source[^3]
- A type of compound that contains hydrogen and dissociates in water to produce positive hydrogen ions. The reaction, for an acid HX, is commonly written:$$\mathrm{HX} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}^{+}+\mathrm{X}^{-}$$In fact, the hydrogen ion (the proton) is hydrated, and the complete reaction is:$$\mathrm{HX}+\mathrm{H}_{2} \mathrm{O} \rightleftharpoons \mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}+\mathrm{X}^{-}$$The ion $\mathrm{H}_{3} \mathrm{O}^{+}$is the hydroxonium ion. The strength of an acid depends on the extent to which it dissociates: strong acids (e.g. sulphuric acid and hydrochloric acid) are almost completely dissociated in water; weak acids (e.g. carbonic acid) are only partially dissociated. See also BUFFER; PH SCALE. Compare BASE.
