- These are the essential qualities of a transaction in database processing: either all or none of the subtasks composing the transaction must be performed (atomicity); the database satisfy all its constraints both at the beginning and at the end of the transaction (consistency); no other database user can access the data being manipulated by the transaction while it is an intermediate, and possibly inconsistent, state (isolation); and, once completed, the effect of the transaction will not be reversed, for example by a system crash and subsequent recovery (durability).
