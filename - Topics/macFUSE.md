## Synthesis
- A software component that allows you to extend macOS's native file system capabilities.
- Enables macOS to mount and interact with file systems that it doesn't natively support, such as various network file systems, encrypted file systems, or specialized archives by acting as a bridge between the macOS kernel and these non-native file systems
	- #question What is meant by specialized archives? 
- The predecessor to macFUSE is OSXFUSE
	- #question Why did it update or rather why did they change their name? Is it similar to how the developers worked on Dynalist and then created something called Obsidian?
