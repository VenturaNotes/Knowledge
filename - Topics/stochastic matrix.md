- A matrix, much used for example in simulation, modelling, and communication theory, in which every row is a probability distribution, i.e. every element lies between 0 and 1 , and the sum of the elements of each row is unity. A doubly stochastic matrix is a stochastic matrix whose transpose is a stochastic matrix.

## Source[^2]
- A square matrix is row stochastic if all the entries are non-negative and the entries in each row add up to 1. It is column stochastic if all the entries are non-negative and the entries in each column add up to 1. A square matrix is stochastic if it is either row stochastic or column stochastic, such as a transition matrix. It is doubly stochastic if it is both row stochastic and column stochastic.
