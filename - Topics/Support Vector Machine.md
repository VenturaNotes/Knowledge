- A support vector machine (SVM) is a deep learning algorithm often used for data classification and regression analysis. SVMs are supervised machine learning algorithms, which means they have to be trained on how to label data before they can be used to classify data and examine the relationship between data points.
- The SVM algorithm focuses on finding a hyperplane (a supervised learning tool that separates and classifies a dataset) that accurately classifies the various points within an existing dataset. SVMs are used in various industries for gene classification, handwriting recognition, facial detection, image classification, and other tasks that use algorithms to classify datasets.
