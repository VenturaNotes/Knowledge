- $n$. a hormone secreted by the cells of the duodenum in response to the presence of partly digested food in the duodenum. It causes contraction of the gall bladder and expulsion of bile into the intestine and stimulates the production of digestive enzymes by the pancreas (see also PANCREATIC JUICE). In the brain cholecystokinin functions as a neurotransmitter, involved in the control of satiety.
## Source[^2]
- (CCK; pancreozymin) A hormone, produced by the duodenal region of the small intestine, that induces the gall bladder to contract and eject bile into the intestine and stimulates the pancreas to secrete its digestive enzymes. Cholecystokinin is released by cells of the duodenal epithelium, in response to fat entering the duodenum.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. A hormone secreted in the duodenum that causes the gall bladder to contract and that stimulates the secretion of enzymes by the pancreas, also present in the central nervous system, where it acts as a neurotransmitter, amplifying the effects of dopamine in the brain. See also KININ. CCK abbrev. \[From Greek chole bile + kystis a bladder + English kinin]
