- a family of plasma proteins whose function is to bind free hormone molecules to varying degrees and thus reduce their function. Alterations in levels of the binding globulins, for example during pregnancy or ill health, can result in variations in assays of hormone levels in individuals. Examples include thyroid-binding globulin, sex-hormone-binding globulin, and corticosteroid-binding globulin.
