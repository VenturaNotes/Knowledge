- $n$. A statistical test that can be applied to data in a $2 \times 2$ contingency table and is especially useful when the total sample size or some of the expected values are small so that the chi-square test cannot be used. This distribution-free test establishes the exact probability, under the null hypothesis that the row and column variables are independent, of obtaining a result as extreme or more extreme than the observed result assuming that the marginals (the row and column totals) are fixed. It is the prototypical randomization test. Also called Fisher's exact probability test, Fisher-Yates test. \[Named after the English statistician and geneticist Ronald Aylmer Fisher (1890-1962) who in 1934 encouraged Frank Yates (1902-94) to develop it]
