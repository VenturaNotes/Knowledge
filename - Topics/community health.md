- preventive services, mainly outside the hospital, involving the surveillance of special groups of the population, such as preschool and school children, women, and the elderly, by means of routine clinical assessment and screening tests. Routine preventive measures, such as immunization, family planning, and dietary advice, are offered in special clinics staffed by community nurses, clinical medical officers, and senior clinical medical officers and sometimes by community paediatricians. When somebody is identified as having an illness, he (or she) is referred for treatment to a general practitioner or hospital as appropriate. See also CHILD HEALTH CLINIC; SCHOOL HEALTH SERVICE.
