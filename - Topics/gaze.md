- $v b . n$. To look steadily at something or someone, or a prolonged and steady look. In social psychology, it refers to steady looking at other people in the region of their eyes, and it is a form of non-verbal communication. It tends to increase with interpersonal liking, but also when a person is attempting to dominate another, and one of its important functions is to regulate turn-taking in conversations: speakers tend to gaze at the beginning and end of a speaking turn. Mutual gaze or eye contact occurs when two people simultaneously gaze in the direction of each other's eyes, as tends to occur at points in a conversation when the floor is handed over smoothly to another speaker. See also B√ÅLINT'S SYNDROME, COMPENSATORY EYE MOVEMENT, Donders' law, DYNAMIC LABYRINTH, EYE-TRACKING, REGULATOR, ROTATING HEAD illusion. \[From Swedish dialect gasa to stare or gape at]
