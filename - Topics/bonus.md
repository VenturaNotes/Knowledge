- A payment to a firm's employees additional to their normal pay. Bonuses may be linked to performance, of either the whole firm, a specified section of it, or the individual recipient. Bonuses provide incentives to employees, both to exert themselves and to stay with the firm rather than look for a better job elsewhere. Bonuses differ from normal pay in that there is no obligation to repeat them, and they are not pensionable. They are normally taxable.

- (1) An extra payment made to employees by management, usually as a reward for good work, to compensate for something (e.g. dangerous work) or to share out the profits of a good year's trading. 
- (2) An extra amount of money additional to the proceeds, which is distributed to a policyholder by an insurer who has made a profit on the investment of a life-assurance fund. Only holders of with-profits policies are entitled to a share in these profits and the payment of this bonus is conditional on the life assurer having surplus funds after claims, costs, and expenses have been paid in a particular year.
- (3) Any extra or unexpected payment. See also NO-CLAIM BONUS; REVERSIONARY BONUS; TERMINAL BONUS.
