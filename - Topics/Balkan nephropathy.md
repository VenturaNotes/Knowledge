- a severe and progressive form of tubulointerstitial renal disease (see TUBULOINTERSTITIUM), first described in 1956 and endemic to certain rural areas along the tributaries of the Danube in Bosnia, Bulgaria, Croatia, Romania, and Serbia. The natural course of the disease is progression to end-stage kidney failure and frequent development of tumours in the upper urinary tract. It seems likely that an environmental factor is responsible for the disease, and evidence supports the theory that long-term consumption of food contaminated with seeds from plants of Aristolochia spp. underlies the pathogenesis.
