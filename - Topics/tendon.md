Some tendons are surrounded by tendon sheaths these are tubular double-layered sacs lined with synovial membrane and containing synovial fluid. Tendon sheaths enclose the flexor tendons at the wrist and ankle, where they minimize friction and facilitate movement. See also APONEUROSIS. â€”tendinous adj.
