- $n$. a tough whitish cord, consisting of numerous parallel bundles of collagen fibers, that serves to attach a muscle to a bone. Tendons are inelastic but flexible; they assist in concentrating the pull of the muscle on a small area of bone. Some tendons are surrounded by tendon sheaths these are tubular double-layered sacs lined with synovial membrane and containing synovial fluid. Tendon sheaths enclose the flexor tendons at the wrist and ankle, where they minimize friction and facilitate movement. See also APONEUROSIS. â€”tendinous adj.
## Source[^2]
- A thick strand or sheet of fibrous connective tissue that attaches a muscle to a bone. Tendons consist of collagen fibres and are therefore inelastic: they ensure that the force exerted by muscular contraction is transmitted to the relevant part of the body to be moved.
