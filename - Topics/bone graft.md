## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- the use of bone or a bonelike synthetic substance to fill a bony defect or to augment bone formation. Bone grafts are usually autografts or allografts, but synthetic bone grafts, using calcium compounds and hydroxyapatite, are increasingly being used. Hard cortical bone can be used to replace structural defects, softer cancellous bone is used to fill voids or to encourage bony union, and synthetic bone grafts act as a scaffold through which normal bony healing can occur.
