- (thigh bone) $n$. a long bone between the hip and the knee (see illustration overleaf). The head of the femur articulates with the acetabulum of the hip bone. The greater and lesser trochanters are protuberances on which the gluteus and psoas major muscles, respectively, are inserted. The lateral and medial condyles articulate with the tibia, and the trochlear groove accommodates the kneecap (patella).

- The narrowed end of the femur (femoral neck), which carries the head, is the commonest site of fracture of the leg in elderly women. Partial dislocation of the femoral epiphysis, the growth area of the upper end of the bone, leads to deformity of the head of the femur and premature degeneration of the hip joint.
