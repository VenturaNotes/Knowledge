## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- An agreement between an organization and its users that sets out how computer equipment, the network, and systems should be used, and specifies the ways in which their use is restricted.

## Source[^2]
- An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a document stipulating constraints and practices that a user must agree to for access to or use of a corporate network, the internet or other computing resources.

## Source[^3]
- The set of rules governing the use that can be made of a network. All network users are expected to conform to any existing legislation, and to any commercial conditions that form part of any contract for the use of commercial networks. In the case of academic or research networks there are also likely to be constraints on using the network to carry commercial traffic, and these will be embodied in the AUP.
