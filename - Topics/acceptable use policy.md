- An agreement between an organization and its users that sets out how computer equipment, the network, and systems should be used, and specifies the ways in which their use is restricted.

## Source[^2]
- An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a document stipulating constraints and practices that a user must agree to for access to or use of a corporate network, the internet or other computing resources.

## Source[^3]
- The set of rules governing the use that can be made of a network. All network users are expected to conform to any existing legislation, and to any commercial conditions that form part of any contract for the use of commercial networks. In the case of academic or research networks there are also likely to be constraints on using the network to carry commercial traffic, and these will be embodied in the AUP.

## Source[^4]
- An acceptable use policy (AUP) is a business agreement between a computer resource user and the computer resource owner or administrator that addresses all of the rights, privileges, and rules that users must adhere to when using computer resources. AUPs are often used by corporations, public institutions, internet service providers (ISPs), and other organizations to ensure that the individuals who access their computer resources use them appropriately. By making computer resource users sign an AUP, businesses can prevent cybersecurity threats, ensure their users arenâ€™t engaging in illegal activities, and avert employees from being distracted by internet-based entertainment sources.
