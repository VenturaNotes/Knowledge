- (tablet) A portable personal computer that is operated using a touchscreen interface rather than a mouse and keyboard. Tablets generally provide an on-screen keyboard for typing, although some hybrid models also have a physical keyboard. A typical tablet is about half the size of a laptop computer but larger than a smartphone. The first successful tablet was Apple's iPad, launched in 2010; it remains the market leader.
