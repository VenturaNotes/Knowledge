- $n$. an enzyme in the stomach that begins the digestion of proteins by splitting them into peptones (see PEPTIDASE). It is produced by the action of hydrochloric acid on pepsinogen, which is secreted by the gastric glands. Once made, pepsin itself can act on pepsinogen to produce more pepsin.
## Source[^2]
- An enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of proteins to polypeptides in the vertebrate stomach. It is secreted as an inactive precursor, pepsinogen.
