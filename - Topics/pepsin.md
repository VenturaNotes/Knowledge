- $n$. an enzyme in the stomach that begins the digestion of proteins by splitting them into peptones (see PEPTIDASE). It is produced by the action of hydrochloric acid on pepsinogen, which is secreted by the gastric glands. Once made, pepsin itself can act on pepsinogen to produce more pepsin.

- An enzyme that catalyses the breakdown of proteins to polypeptides in the vertebrate stomach. It is secreted as an inactive precursor, pepsinogen.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any of a group of digestive enzymes produced in the stomach in the inactive form pepsinogen and activated by the presence of acids to contribute to digestion by breaking down proteins into their component amino acids. Also spelt pepsine. See also gastric gland. peptic adj. Of or relating to pepsin or digestion. \[From Greek peptein to digest]
