- the small area of the retina of the eye where the nerve fibers from the light-sensitive cells (see CONE; ROD) lead into the optic nerve. There are no rods or cones in this area and hence it does not register light. Anatomical name: punctum caecum.
## Source[^2]
- The portion of the retina at which blood vessels and nerve fibers enter the optic nerve. There are no rods or cones in this area, so no visual image can be transmitted from it.

- $n$. 
- (1) A small oval area on the retina of each eye, approximately 2 millimeters in diameter, where the ganglion cells in the inner retinal layer, nearest the front of the eye, feed backwards through the retina into the optic nerve, and where there are therefore no photoreceptors and vision is absent. Squids and octopuses do not have blind spots, because their eyes have evolved with the retinal layers arranged the other way round, with the ganglion cells in the outer retinal layer at the back of the eye. A person is not ordinarily aware of a blind spot because the gap is covered by vision from the other eye, and if one eye is closed it is not noticed because of the filling-in phenomenon, but its location can be mapped as follows. Gaze fixedly at a distant object with one eye, keeping the other eye closed, and hold a small distinctive stimulus such as a cotton bud or Q-tip at arm's length directly in front of the object, then slowly move the stimulus horizontally outwards from the direction of gaze until it vanishes approximately 18 degrees out$\textemdash$about the width of one's hand at arm's length. Also called an optic disc . 
- (2) Any part of the visual field in which vision is absent. Also called a scotoma.
- (3) Any place where vision, hearing, or reception of broadcast signals is difficult or impossible. 
- (4) A topic on which a person is notably ignorant or lacking in insight or ability.
