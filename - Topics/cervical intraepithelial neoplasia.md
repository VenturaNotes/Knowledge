- (CIN) cellular changes in the cervix of the uterus preceding the invasive stages of cervical cancer. The CIN grading system distinguishes three stages: CIN 1 (mild dysplasia); CIN 2 (moderate dysplasia); and CIN 3 (severe dysplasia, carcinoma in situ). CIN is uncommon after the menopause. Treatment may be by local ablation (e.g. cold coagulation (applying a heated probe to the transformation zone), cryocautery, electrodiathermy, or carbon dioxide laser vaporization) or by surgical excision (e.g. LLETZ, cone biopsy, or hysterectomy).
