- (investment company) A company that invests the funds provided by shareholders in a wide variety of securities. It makes its profits from the income and capital gains provided by these securities. The investments made are usually restricted to securities quoted on a stock exchange, but some will invest in unlisted companies. The advantages for shareholders are much the same as those with unit trusts, i.e. spreading the risk of investment and making use of professional managers. Investment trusts, which are not generally trusts in the usual sense, but private or public limited companies, differ from unit trusts in that in the latter the investors buy units in the fund but are not shareholders. Some investment trusts aim for high capital growth (capital shares), others for high income (income shares).
- The profits of an investment trust are subject to corporation tax at the full rate; the lower rates of tax applied to trading companies are not available. They are also subject to special provisions in relation to dividends. See also SPLIT-CAPITAL INVESTMENT TRUST; VENTURE CAPITAL TRUST.

- A company that invests its shareholders' funds in a portfolio of securities. These are normally quoted on a stock exchange; trusts may select from a wide range, or concentrate on securities from particular sectors or countries. They may aim for varying combinations of income and capital growth. Using investment trusts gives investors the benefits of a varied portfolio without excessive transaction costs, and the services of professional management. Investment trusts are distinguished from unit trusts, where a trustee holds the portfolio for the benefit of the unit holders.
