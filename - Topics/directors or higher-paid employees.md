- Under UK tax law, a 'higher-paid employee' is defined as one earning more than $Â£ 8,500$ per annum. This amount, which has remained unaltered since it was set in 1979 and is now below the minimum wage, includes remuneration together with benefits and reimbursed expenses. An employer must account to HM Revenue and Customs, on form P11D, for all the benefits received by a higher-paid employee or director (for whom there is no earnings limit). These benefits are assessed at the cost to the employer, although special rules apply to certain benefits, e.g. company cars. See BENEFITS IN KIND.
