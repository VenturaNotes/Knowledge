- A protocol for transmitting authentication requests and responses and associated accounting records across an IP network. RADIUS is frequently used by Internet Service Providers to carry login requests from a modem or other network access device to a central user authentication database. RADIUS is not itself an authentication protocol, but supports a wide range of different authentication methods.
