- (WACC) A method for calculating the average cost of a company's different sources of finance. The WACC is calculated on the assumption that the company will maintain the same debt-equity ratio. Managers should only use the WACC as an appropriate discount rate for a project when the project has about the same level of risk as the company. The most difficult part of the calculation is the estimate for the cost of equity.
- In theory, a company can lower its weighted average cost of capital by increasing the proportion of debt. However, this could become a problem for shareholders, who may feel that higher levels of debt will increase the risk of their investment. See also COST OF CAPITAL.
