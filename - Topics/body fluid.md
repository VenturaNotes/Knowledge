- Any of the fluids found within animals, including blood, lymph, tissue fluid, urine, bile, sweat, and synovial fluid. Body fluids are generally involved with the processes of transport, excretion, homeostasis, or lubrication. They allow the distribution of oxygen and nutrients to the tissues and organs and the transport of waste products from the tissues, enabling their elimination from the body.
