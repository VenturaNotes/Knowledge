- $n$. surgical removal of sections of the large bowel (colon), either the ascending colon (right hemicolectomy) or the descending colon (left hemicolectomy). An extended hemicolectomy involves the additional excision of a section of the transverse colon. Such operations are performed in cases of inflammation (e.g. Crohn's disease) or cancer. The cut ends of the remaining bowel are joined together in a primary anastomosis.
