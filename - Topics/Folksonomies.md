- Folksonomies (also called social tagging) are collections of metadata defined by users, such as user-generated tags on web pages, forums, photos, and other online content. These tags make it easier for users to find what they are looking for. For example, a photo of the New York City skyline might have the following folksonomies: "New York City," "skyscrapers," "skyline," and "city." A user can click on the folksonomy "city" to bring up photos of other cities.
