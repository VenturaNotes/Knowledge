- (CAATs) Techniques developed by auditors for performing audit tests on computer systems and the data they hold. There are two main categories of technique. (1) The auditor creates a set of input data to be processed by the computer programs; the results are then checked against the expected results. (2) Computer audit software is used by the auditor to select data from a number of files. Various operations are then performed on the data and the results are transferred to a special audit file to be printed out in a required format.
