- A routine is an action or set of actions that are completed at specific intervals of time. In business, employees typically have certain routines that they follow on a daily basis, such as clocking in and out of work at a specific time. Assigning employees routines to follow in the workplace helps employers keep their teams on task. In the computer programming industry, a routine is a component of a software application that performs a specific task. Software programmers often use routines to execute repetitive tasks, such as saving a file, eliminating the need to rewrite code during the development process.
