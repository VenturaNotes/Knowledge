An epileptic aura (sometimes known as the preictal phase, because it precedes the main ictus or seizure) may take many forms, such as an odd smell or taste. The migrainous aura may affect the patient's eyesight with visual phenomena, such as fortification spectra (zigzag lines) or scotomas (black holes in the visual field), but it may also result in pins and needles, weakness of the limbs, or aphasia.
