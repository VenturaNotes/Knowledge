- (quant trading) Any financial trading strategy based on trends or patterns identified by analyzing large quantities of complex data on such variables as price and volume. Quantitative trading is used mainly by large financial institutions. In particular, the predictive models established by data mining are used to formulate the computer algorithms used in high-volume high-frequency trading. The mathematicians employed to analyze data and produce models are known informally as quants.
