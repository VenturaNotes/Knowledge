- (MSE) The MSE of an estimator, $\hat{\theta}$, is defined as $\mathrm{E}\left[(\hat{\theta}-\theta)^{2}\right]$ where $\theta$ is the estimated parameter. The MSE is equal to the sum of the variance of the estimator and the square of its bias. MSE is often used as a criterion for comparing alternative estimators of the same parameter: the one with smaller MSE is preferred.
