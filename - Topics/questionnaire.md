- A structured set of questions designed to generate the information required for a specific purpose, especially in marketing research. The preparation of the questionnaire requires considerable expertise. The questionnaire can make use of multiple-choice questions, with a series of formal questions designed to produce limited responses; alternatively it can use more open-ended questions, giving respondents an opportunity to air their views. The latter type of questions are often used with small samples to provide the basis of questionnaires for larger samples.
