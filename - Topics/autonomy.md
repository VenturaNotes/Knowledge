- n. literally 'self-rule', the capacity for reasoned self-determination in thought and action. Respect for the autonomy of all persons with capacity, particularly patients, is one of the four principles of medical ethics. In practice, a patient's capacity to exercise autonomy may be constrained by various circumstances, but in law it is formally safeguarded by the need for valid consent to treatment or research. Autonomy is not unlimited in its scope, e.g. as a general principle, patients can request but not demand treatment. Professional autonomy involves reflective practice and attempting to follow one's own principles consistently and confidently. $\textemdash$ autonomous adj.
