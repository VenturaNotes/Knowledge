- A URL (uniform resource locator) is a unique identifier in the form of a character string that's used to retrieve or locate a document or resource on the internet. It's commonly referred to as a web address. URLs consist of a protocol, file name, and domain/hostname, which collectively guide a web browser to find a specific resource.
