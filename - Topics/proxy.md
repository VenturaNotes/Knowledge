- A device that handles network traffic on behalf of another: a client will send a request to a proxy, which will then make the same request to a server, to which the proxy appears to be a client. The response from the server is returned to the proxy and then passed to the original client. Proxies are often used as part of a firewall to allow complex protocols to be handled; they may also examine requests and responses, route requests to different servers or filter responses in accordance with some policy.

- A person who acts in the place of a member of a company at a company meeting at which one or more votes are taken. The proxy need not be a member of the company but it is quite common for directors to offer themselves as proxies for shareholders who cannot attend a meeting. Notices calling meetings must state that a member may appoint a proxy and the appointment of a proxy is usually done on a form provided by the company with the notice of the meeting; it must be returned to the company not less than 48 hours before the meeting. A two-way proxy form is printed so that the member can state whether the proxy should vote for or against a particular resolution. A special proxy is empowered to act at one specified meeting; a general proxy is authorized to vote at any meeting.
