- The second of seven bony V-shaped arches that support the gills of fish. The dorsal part is specialized as the hyomandibular, which is involved in jaw suspension (see AMPHISTYLIC JAW SUSPENSION; HYOSTYLIC JAW SUSPENSION). In tetrapods the dorsal part of the hyoid arch has evolved to form the stapes (one of the ear ossicles). The ventral part forms the hyoid bone, which supports the tongue.
