- The hyphae, in fungi of the Ascomycota, that grow from the ascogonium after it has fused with the antheridium. The ascogenous hyphae are made up of binucleate cells containing one nucleus derived from the male antheridium and the other from the female ascogonium. This condition is represented as $n+n$, rather than $2 n$, as the cells are not true diploid cells. Asci (see ASCUS) develop from the ascogenous hyphae.
