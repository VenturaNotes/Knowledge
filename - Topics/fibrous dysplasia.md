- a developmental abnormality in which changes occur in bony tissue. Trabecular bone is replaced by fibrous tissue, resulting in aching and a tendency to pathological fracture. In monostotic fibrous dysplasia one bone is affected; polyostotic fibrous dysplasia involves many bones. There is a small risk (5-10%) of malignant transformation (fibrosarcoma).
