- (VMA) a metabolite of catecholamines excreted in abnormal amounts in the urine in conditions of excess catecholamine production, such as phaeochromocytoma. The measurement of VMA levels in a 24 -hour urine sample was formerly used as a screening test for this condition, but in the UK it has been largely superseded by the urinary metanephrine test (see METANEPHRINE AND NORMETANEPHRINE).
