- (1) One of the meaningful units (names, constants, reserved words, etc.) in the input to a compiler. The lexical analyzer breaks up the input, which is a stream of characters, into a sequence of tokens. 
- (2) A unique sequence of bits granting send permission on a network. See token bus, token ring. 
- (3) See Petri net. 
- (4) (security token) A device that, employed together with something that a user knows (e.g. a password), will enable authorized access to a computer system or network. The device may be physical, in which case it is a hard token (e.g. a smart card); or it may be logical, in which case it is a soft token.

- The term token varies in meaning depending on industry context.
- In the computer programming industry, a token can be described as the building block of a programming language. There are five categories of tokens including constants, identifiers, operators, separators, and reserved words that can be used to write computer code.
- In the computer networking industry, a token is a data frame that is transmitted between network points on a token ring network. Token ring networks prevent data packets from colliding on a network, and only allow token holders to send data to other computers. Token rings are not commonly used today, as most businesses opt to use Ethernet technology to provide a local area network for their computer devices.
- In the cryptocurrency industry, tokens represent a digital or physical asset on the blockchain.
- In the cybersecurity industry, a security token is a physical or digital device used as a form of user identification to provide access to a computer system or application that uses two-factor authentication. Sometimes security tokens take the form of radio frequency identification (RFID) smart cards that are used to access company buildings.
