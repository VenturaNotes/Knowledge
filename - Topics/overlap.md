## Synthesis
- 
## Source [^1]
- A form of parallelism in which events that are not mutually dependent take place concurrently in order to increase computer performance, e.g. fetching a second instruction while a first instruction is being executed. When there is overlap between portions of arithmetic operations (i.e. when the portions are overlapped), the process is usually called pipelining.
