- A summary of the structure and components of a flower using symbols and numbers. The symbols representing symmetry include $\oplus$ (for actinomorphy) and $\cdot \mid \cdot$, $\downarrow$, or $\uparrow$ (for zygomorphy). The parts of the flower are represented by K (for calyx), C (for corolla), P (for perianth), A (for androecium), and G (for gynoecium). These are followed by numbers indicating the number of parts in each whorl (e.g. K5 indicates a calyx of five sepals); $\infty$ indicates an indefinite number of parts (more than 12). If the parts are fused the number is in parentheses; if they are in separate groups or whorls the number is split (e.g. C2 + 2 indicates a corolla of two whorls each of two petals). The symbol G has a line above it to indicate an inferior ovary and a line beneath it to indicate a superior ovary. For example, the buttercup flower has the following floral formula:$$\oplus K5C5A\infty \underline G\infty$$
	- #question Is the underline under the G important? Why isn't there a line above in the formula shown?
- i.e. it has a calyx of five sepals, a corolla of five petals, an androecium of many stamens, and a superior ovary consisting of many carpels.
