- Crowdsourcing is a way of obtaining data from a large group of people. It usually involves people submitting their data over the internet to a collection point via social media, an online form, a mobile app, or a shared drive. Sometimes, this data might be opinions about a specific aspect of a product or service. At other times, it might be more practical information. Examples include traffic apps that use information from users to constantly improve the app's usefulness. Users can report traffic incidents or closed highways to make the app more accurate.
