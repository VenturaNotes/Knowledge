- Any equation for an unknown function involving integrals and derivatives of the function. Many different types can arise and there is no straightforward classification. The initial-value problem (see ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS) given by$$\begin{aligned}& f^{\prime}(x)=F\left(x, f(x), \int_{a}^{x} K(x, y) f(y) \mathrm{d} y\right) \\& f(a)=f_{0}\end{aligned}$$also contains features common to Volterra integral equations (see INTEGRAL EQUATION). Boundary-value problems and equations involving partial derivatives also occur in practice.
