- A logarithmic scale for expressing the acidity or alkalinity of a solution. To a first approximation, the pH of a solution can be defined as$\textemdash$$\log _{10} \!\mathrm{c}$, where cis the concentration of hydrogen ions in moles per cubic decimetre. A neutral solution at $25^{\circ} \mathrm{C}$ has a hydrogen-ion concentration of $10^{-7} \mathrm{~mol}~ \mathrm{dm}^{-3}$, so the pH is 7. A pH below 7 indicates an acid solution; one above 7 indicates an alkaline solution. pH stands for 'potential of hydrogen'. The scale was introduced by S. P. SÃ¸rensen (1868-1939) in 1909.
