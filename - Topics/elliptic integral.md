- A function $f(x)$ which can be expressed as an integral of the form $$f(x) = \int R(x, \sqrt{P(x)})\space dx$$where R is a rational function and P is a cubic or quartic polynomial with no repeated roots. The name arose because integrals in this form were first studied in connection with the arc length of an ellipse. Investigating the inverse functions of elliptic integrals led to the study of elliptic functions.
