- The simple operations that can be performed on sets are those of union, intersection, and complement, and possibly set difference. Using these it is possible to create new sets from existing sets. Certain other actions that have to be performed on sets are sometimes considered as operations, although they do not conform to the strict definition of the word. These include the actions find, insert, delete, split, and min.
