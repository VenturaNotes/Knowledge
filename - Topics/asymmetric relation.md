- A relation $R$ defined on a set $S$ and having the property that $$\text{whenever } xRy$$then it is never the case that$$y R x$$where $x$ and $y$ are arbitrary elements of $S$. The usual 'is less than' ordering defined on the integers is an asymmetric relation. See also ANTISYMMETRIC RELATION, SYMMETRIC RELATION.

## Source[^2]
- A binary relation $\sim$ on a set $S$ is asymmetric if, for all $a$ and $b$ in $S$, whenever $a \sim b$, then $b \sim a$ does not hold. For example, the relation $<$ on the set of integers is asymmetric. Compare ANTISYMMETRIC RELATION.
