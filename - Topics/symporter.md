## Synthesis

- A transport protein that couples the movement of a substance across a cell membrane with the simultaneous movement of ions in the same direction. The substance is 'pulled' uphill against its concentration gradient by the flow of the ions down their pre-existing concentration gradient. Hence, it is a form of active transport, powered by the energy stored in the ionic concentration gradient, which is maintained by cellular mechanisms. For example, kidney tubule cells contain a sodium/glucose symporter that exploits the gradient of sodium ions $\left(\mathrm{Na}^{+}\right)$across the plasma membrane; for every two $\mathrm{Na}^{+}$that flow inwards it imports one glucose molecule. Compare ANTIPORTER; UNIPORTER.
