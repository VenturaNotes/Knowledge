- An amount paid to an organization to assist it to pursue activities considered socially or economically desirable. Grants may be revenue-based, i.e. made by reference to a specified category of revenue expenditure. Revenue-based grants should be credited to the profit and loss account in the same period as the revenue expenditure to which they relate. Capital-based grants are made by reference to specified categories of capital expenditure and should be credited to the profit and loss account over the useful economic life of the asset to which they relate. Section 24 of the new Financial Reporting Standard Applicable in the UK and Republic of Ireland gives guidance with respect to the treatment of grants.
