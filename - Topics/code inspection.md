- A review technique carried out at the end of the coding phase for a module. A specification (and design documentation) for the module is distributed to the inspection team in advance. M. E. Fagan recommends an inspection team of about four people. The module programmer explains the module code to the rest of the team. A moderator records detected faults in the code and ensures there is no discussion of corrections. The code designer and code tester complete the team. Any faults are corrected outside the inspection, and reinspection may take place subject to the quality targets adopted.
