## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- (1)Of hardware, the ability of a subsystem (e.g. memory) or an external device (e.g. a terminal) to be substituted for the originally designated equipment. To designate that one manufacturer’s hardware can be connected to another manufacturer’s hardware, the terms plug-to-plug compatible, or [[plug-compatible]], are used. The ability of new hardware to handle interfaces of previous generations is called [[backward compatibility]]. 
- (2) Of software, the ability of a computer to execute directly program code that was compiled, assembled, or written in machine language for another computer. Generally this occurs for successive computers in a given manufacturer’s line. Since later computers are usually more capable (i.e. have a larger instruction set and/or more memory), the ability to run the program of a less capable machine is usually called [[upward compatibility]] or backward compatibility. See also PORTABLE, EMULATION. 
- (3) (of a new piece of software) The ability to reproduce the behavior of its predecessor, in particular to accept the same input formats.

- Compatibility refers to the degree to which a product meets some or all of the specifications for a particular standard. Two software systems can be considered compatible if they can work together without having to be altered. Compatibility also refers to the interoperability of any two computer products, including hardware and software, different versions of the same products, and differing product types.

- $n$. the degree to which the body's defence systems will tolerate the presence of intruding foreign material, such as blood when transfused or a kidney when transplanted. Complete compatibility exists between identical twins: a blood transfusion between identical twins will evoke no antibody formation in the recipient. In severe incompatibility, for example between completely unrelated people, there are likely to be swift immune reactions as antibodies attack and destroy any offending antigenic material. See also HistocompatibilitY; IMMUNITY. $\textemdash$compatible adj.
