## Source [^1]
- $n$. the development of techniques for the application of biological processes to the production of materials of use in medicine and industry. For example, the production of many antibiotics relies on the activity of various fungi and bacteria. Recent techniques of genetic engineering, in which human genes are cloned in bacterial cells, have enabled the large-scale production of hormones (notably insulin), vaccines, interferon, and other useful products.

- The development of techniques for the application of biological processes to the production of materials of use in medicine and industry. For example, the production of antibiotics, cheese, and wine rely on the activity of various fungi and bacteria. Genetic engineering can modify bacterial cells, plants, or animals to synthesize completely new substances, e.g. hormones, vaccines, monoclonal antibodies, etc., or introduce novel traits into plants or animals. See also BIOENGINEERING; SYNTHETIC BIOLOGY.
## Source[^3]
- n. 
- (1) The industrial use of living organisms, especially bacteria, to manufacture substances such as beer, wine, cheese, antibiotics, hormones, or vaccines, to recycle waste, or to create energy. See also MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY. 
- (2) In the US, another name for ergonomics.
