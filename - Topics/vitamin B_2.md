## Source [^1]
- (riboflavin) a vitamin of the B complex that is a constituent of the coenzymes FAD (flavine adenine dinucleotide) and FMN (flavine mononucleotide). Riboflavin is therefore important in tissue respiration; it is also required to aid the absorption of iron. A deficiency of riboflavin causes a condition known as ariboflavinosis, which is not usually serious. Good sources of riboflavin are liver, milk, and eggs. The adult RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) is $1.3-1.6~ \mathrm{mg} /$ day.
