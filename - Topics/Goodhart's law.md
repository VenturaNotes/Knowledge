## Synthesis

- Originally, an economic theory stating that if a particular definition of the money supply were to be used as the basis for monetary policy, the stability of its statistical relationship with spending on the economy would break down and the policy would prove ineffective. The law is now used more widely to highlight the problems of focusing on the value of any specific variable as an indicator. In simple terms, when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure. The applications to performance measurement in management accounting and other aspects of business are obvious.

## Source[^2]
- The observation by the economist C. Goodhart (b. 1936) that when an empirical regularity starts to be exploited as a basis for economic policy, it is liable to break down. This is one application of the Lucas critique, that the observed behavior of economic systems is affected by the economic policies in force. If the policy regime changes, the behavior of the economy is liable to change, so that econometric models fitted during earlier policy regimes become unreliable as a basis for predicting the effects of new policies.
