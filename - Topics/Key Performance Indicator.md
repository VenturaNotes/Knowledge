- A key performance indicator (KPI) measures progress toward important business objectives or targets. KPIs differ according to the type of objective and scope. They can measure a company's achievements relative to past performance or the performance of competitors. High-level KPIs focus on the big picture such as annual revenue. Lower-level KPIs evaluate functions in various departments such as sales, marketing, product development, customer service and support, and HR.
