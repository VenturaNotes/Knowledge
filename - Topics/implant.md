- n. 
- (1) a drug (such as a subcutaneous hormone implant), a prosthesis (such as an artificial hip, an intraocular lens implant (see CATARACT), a breast implant, a cochlear implant, or an artificial heart implant: see VENTRICULAR ASSIST DEVICE), or a radioactive source (such as radium needles) that is put into the body. 
- (2) (in dentistry) a rigid structure that is embedded in bone or under its periosteum to provide support for replacement teeth on a denture, crown, or bridge. Recent types (osseointegrated implants) consist of a number of special titanium alloy inserts (fixtures), placed in the jawbone, onto which abutments are fitted after the bone has healed and fused with the fixture. Later an artificial-tooth superstructure is bolted onto the abutments. Osseointegrated implants are also used to retain facial prostheses. See also OSSEOINTEGRATION.
