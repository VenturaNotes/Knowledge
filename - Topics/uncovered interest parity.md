- A relationship between domestic and foreign interest rates derived under the assumption that the forward currency market is not used to hedge exchange rate risk. Uncovered interest parity requires$$\left(1+r_{a}\right)=\left(1+r_{b}\right) e_{0} / E\left(e_{1}\right)$$where $r_{a}$ is the domestic interest rate, $r_{b}$ is the foreign interest rate, $e_{0}$ the current exchange rate, and $E\left(e_{1}\right)$ the expected future exchange rate. See also COVERED INTEREST PARITY.
