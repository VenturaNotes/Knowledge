- The basic belief originally held by molecular geneticists, that flow of genetic information can only occur from DNA to RNA to proteins. It is now known, however, that information contained within RNA molecules can also flow back to DNA, for example in the replication of retroviruses. See also GENETIC CODE.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. In genetics, the principle according to which genetic information is transferred from DNA to the proteins that it encodes, and not from protein to DNA, therefore implying that although genes can influence the form of an organism's body or its behavior, the form of the organism's body or its behavior cannot influence its genes. In a stronger formulation of the dogma, information supposedly flows unidirectionally from DNA to RNA and from RNA to proteins, but that version had to be abandoned with the discovery of retroviruses. See also Weismannism.
