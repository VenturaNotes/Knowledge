- (IVUS) a technique in which a micro ultrasound transducer is mounted on a catheter, which is then advanced over a guidewire into a blood vessel. IVUS is used to accurately assess the diameter of the blood vessels before any treatment, to assess any internal abnormality within the blood vessels, or to help mark the blood vessel branches during any stent placement.
