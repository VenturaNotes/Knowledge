- In the UK, a type of low-cost pension available since April 2001. Stakeholder pensions are bought from authorized financial institutions, such as insurance companies, banks, and building societies. The pension providers can only charge a maximum of $1 \%$ of the value of the pension fund each year to manage the fund, plus costs. Any extra services and any extra charges not provided for by law, such as advice on choosing a pension or life assurance cover, must be optional. All stakeholder schemes will accept contributions of as little as $Â£ 20$, payable weekly, monthly, or at less regular intervals. The scheme must be run by trustees or by an authorized stakeholder manager.
- Employers with five or more employees were formerly required to make a stakeholder pension scheme available to their staff; since 2016 this has been replaced by automatic enrolment of most employees into workplace pension schemes, most of which will be stakeholder schemes in form.
