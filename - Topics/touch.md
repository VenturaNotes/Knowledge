- The sense that enables the pressure exerted by objects and substances, and hence their surface texture, to be perceived. Touch receptors occur in the skin, being concentrated in sensitive areas such as the tips of the finger in humans. Generally, they consist of nerve endings (dendrites) encapsulated in connective tissue and located at different depths in the skin according to the type of stimulus they detect. Meissner's corpuscles respond to changes in pressure, whereas Merkel's discs provide information about sustained pressure. Ruffini's capsules and Pacinian corpuscles respond to vibrating stimuli of varying frequencies, while naked dendrites wind around the base of hairs to sense hair movements.
