- An informal term referring to a market in which conditions are much better for sellers than for buyers. If sellers are scarce and are in no hurry to dispose of their assets, while buyers are numerous and are under strong pressure to satisfy their requirements quickly, it is likely that the current trading price will be high relative to the average price in the past, and that conditions of sale will be favorable for sellers.
