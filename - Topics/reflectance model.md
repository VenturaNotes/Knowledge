- A mathematical model of how light is reflected from a surface based on a reflectance function. The basic reflectance model assumes that all surfaces are perfect mirrors. More realistic models use reflectance functions that more accurately represent the properties of real surfaces (see also Соок-ТогRANCE MODEL, SPECULAR REFLECTION).
