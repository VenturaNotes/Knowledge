- $n$. a widely distributed genus of lice. The crab (or pubic) louse, $P$. pubis, is a common parasite of humans that lives permanently attached to the body hair, particularly that of the pubic or perianal regions but also on the eyelashes and the hairs in the armpits. Crab lice are not known to transmit disease but their bites can irritate the skin (see PEDICULOSIS). An infestation may be acquired during sexual intercourse or from hairs left on clothing, towels, and lavatory seats.
