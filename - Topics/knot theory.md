- In topology, the study of knots. It was first formally considered by Gauss, while the physicist Peter Tait was the first to seek to classify knots up to knot equivalence. Knot theory has applications in understanding the knotting of DNA and has been found more widely to have connections with statistical mechanics and even quantum computation.

## Source[^2]
- A branch of topology used to classify knots and entanglements. Knot theory has applications to the study of the properties of polymers (particularly polymers of biological interest, such as DNA and proteins) and the statistical mechanics of certain models of phase transitions. At the end of the 19th century Lord Kelvin suggested that atoms of the different elements of the periodic table might correspond to different knots. Although this suggestion was incorrect, it did stimulate the development of knot theory. About 100 years later it was found that a combination of quantum theory and topology could be used to classify knots.
