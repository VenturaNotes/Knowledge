- $n$. the surgical removal of the entire uterus through an incision in the abdominal wall (total abdominal hysterectomy, TAH), or through the vagina (vaginal hysterectomy), or by minimal access (laparoscopic abdominal hysterectomy, LAH). Subtotal hysterectomy (rarely performed now unless as a laparoscopic procedure) involves removing the body of the uterus but leaving the neck (cervix). Hysterectomy is performed for cancerous conditions affecting the uterus and for nonmalignant conditions (e.g. fibroids) in which there is excessive menstrual bleeding. Abdominal hysterectomy carries a higher risk of morbidity than vaginal hysterectomy; the latter is therefore the preferred route unless contraindicated. Laparoscopic hysterectomy is the recommended operation for endometrial cancer.
