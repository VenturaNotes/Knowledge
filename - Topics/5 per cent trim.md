- n. In statistics, the arithmetic mean calculated after eliminating the largest five per cent and smallest five per cent of the cases. It is used occasionally when a set of scores contains values that are much smaller or much larger than the rest, because in such cases it may yield a more useful indication of central tendency than the untrimmed mean. See also TRIMMED MEAN.
