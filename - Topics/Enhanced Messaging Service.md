- Enhanced Messaging Service (EMS) was a technology that came to rise shortly after the first Short Messaging Service (SMS). It was meant to serve as an extension of text messaging. It had many advantages over traditional SMS services. This included sending pictures, icons, and alternative fonts. Ultimately, Multimedia Messaging Services (MMS) eclipsed the need for EMS after adopting many of the functions of EMS.
