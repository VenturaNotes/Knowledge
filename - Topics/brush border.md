- A region of surface epithelium that possesses densely packed microvilli (see microvillus), rather like the bristles of a brush. This greatly increases the surface area of the epithelium and facilitates the absorption of materials. Brush borders are found in the convoluted tubules of the kidney and in the lining of the small intestine.
