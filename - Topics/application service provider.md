## Source[^2]
- An application service provider (ASP) refers to any business that provides individuals or organizations with access to an application or related services over the internet. Some of the most common types of ASPs that businesses work with include customer relationship management software and human resource management applications. ASP is often confused with SaaS (Software as a Service) but the two are not the same as ASP requires the installation of the software on a computer, whereas SaaS relies solely on access through a web browser.
