- $n$. 
- (1) an enclosure of material (usually transparent plastic) around a patient in bed, into which a gas or vapour can be passed as part of treatment. An oxygen tent is relatively inefficient as a means of administering oxygen; a face mask or intranasal oxygen are used where possible. 
- (2) a piece of dried vegetable material, usually a seaweed stem, shaped to fit into an orifice, such as the cervical canal. As it absorbs moisture it expands, providing a slow but forceful means of dilating the orifice.
