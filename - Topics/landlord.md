- The owner of land or buildings, entitled to use them or to charge others rent for their use. The rent received is partly a pure economic rent, and partly a return on capital used in improving land or constructing buildings. A landlord's relation with tenants is governed by contracts and legal controls affecting both rents and security of tenure. A ground landlord is one who has granted tenants a lease, which may fix ground rents in advance, and impose conditions on the tenant.
