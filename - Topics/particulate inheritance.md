- The transmission from parent to offspring of separate units that determine characteristics. Gregor Mendel observed that recessive characteristics, absent in the offspring of a cross in which only one parent possessed them, reappeared repeatedly in the progeny of subsequent crosses. This led him to formulate his theory of inherited 'factors' (now called alleles) that retain their identity through succeeding generations (see MENDEL'S LAWS). Compare BLENDING INHERITANCE.
