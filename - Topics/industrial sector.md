- The part of the economy concerned with producing goods without much direct input of natural resources. This secondary sector is distinguished from the primary producing sector, that is agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and mining and quarrying, which produces goods with large direct inputs of natural resources, and the tertiary sector, including, for example, transport, distribution, finance, health, education, and administration, which produces services.
