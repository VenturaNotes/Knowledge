- a rare disease, occurring commonly (but not exclusively) in males, in which absorption of digested food in the intestine is reduced. As well as symptoms and signs of malabsorption there is usually abdominal pain, skin pigmentation, and arthritis. Diagnosis is usually made by small-intestinal biopsy (duodenal or jejunal biopsy) demonstrating the presence of PAS-positive (see PERIODIC ACID-SCHIFF REACTION) macrophages containing the causative microorganism, Tropheryma whipplei. The disease usually responds to a prolonged course of antibiotics. \[G. H. Whipple (1878-1976), US pathologist]
