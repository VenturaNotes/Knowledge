- (complementary supply) The supply of two or more separate commodities that are produced by the same process; examples include milk and butter, wool and mutton, and petrol and heavy oil. If the demand for one increases, the supply of the other will also increase, but its price will fall unless its demand also increases.

## Source[^2]
- The supply conditions when outputs are produced jointly. If two or more goods are produced by the same process in completely inflexible proportions, there is no supply curve for each good separately, only for the fixed combination of goods. If the proportions can be varied, the supply curve for each good depends on the extra costs involved in changing the production process so as to obtain more of it.
