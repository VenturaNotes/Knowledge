- The analysis of handwriting as a tool of personnel selection. In theory, a person's handwriting is supposed to reveal aspects of their personality and character, so a company might use a graphologist to produce profiles of the candidates for a job based on handwriting samples. This method of profiling candidates has low validity but is nonetheless sometimes used by management.

- $n$. The study of handwriting from all angles, including its relationship with character or personality. Speculation about this possibility can be traced to ancient Rome, where in the second century Seutonius Tranquillus remarked on peculiarities in Augustus Caesar's handwriting, and modern interest in graphology was stimulated by the French Abbot Jean Hippolyte Michon (1806-81), who coined the word in the title of his book Syst√®me de Graphologie (1875). Graphologists study variations of size, layout, slant, connectedness, speed, regularity, letter forms, angularity, and shading of handwriting, but relationships with objective measures of personality have generally produced only weak and unstable correlations. None the less, graphology has been popular as a selection tool in Germany and other continental European countries since the publication of the influential book Handschrift und Charakter (1940, Handwriting and Character) by the German philosopher and psychologist Ludwig Klages (1872-1956). \[From Greek graphein to write + logos word, discourse, or reason]
