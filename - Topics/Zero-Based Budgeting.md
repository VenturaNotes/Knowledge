- Zero-based budgeting (ZBB) is a budgeting method that involves creating a new budget from scratch for each financial period (one month, three months, six months, etc.) Users justify all expenses from a zero base each time, and ensure that each line on a projected return aligns with the company's goals. For example, if a company receives $10,000 a month, it uses that amount to budget for all expenses, debts, and savings until it has $0. Then it does the same the following month and so on.
