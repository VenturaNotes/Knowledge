- A theory of the electronic structures of inorganic complexes, in which the complex is assumed to consist of a central metal atom or ion surrounded by ligands that are ions. For example, the complex $[PtCL_4]^{2-}$ is thought of as a $Pt^{2+}$ ion surrounded by four $Cl^{-}$ ions at the corners of a square. The presence of these ions affects the energies of the d-orbitals, causing a splitting of energy levels. The theory can be used to explain the spectra of complexes and their magnetic properties. Crystal-field theory was initiated in 1929 by the German-born US physicist Hans Albrecht Bethe (1906-2005) and extensively developed in the 1930s. Ligand-field theory extended crystal-field theory by combining it with molecular-orbital theory, with the effect that covalent bonding between transition metal atoms and ligands can be taken into account. This can also be achieved by combining crystal-field theory with valence-bond theory.
