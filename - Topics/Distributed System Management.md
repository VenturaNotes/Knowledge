- Distributed system management (DSM) is the management of the various components of a distributed system. These components are located on different networked machines, but they work together as a single coherent system. Also, they are managed by a central monitoring station that responds only when all components are active and connected. DSM helps IT teams monitor and identify which parts of a system are working and which are having difficulties.
