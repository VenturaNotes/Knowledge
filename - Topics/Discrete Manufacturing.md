- Discrete manufacturing refers to a specific type of manufacturing that focuses on distinct items. Many items you see in the store come from discrete manufacturing, from a coffee cup to a computer monitor. But, discrete manufacturing products cannot be divided. So, the liquid component of hand sanitizer is made in batches then divided up, meaning it's not from a discrete manufacturing process.
