## Synthesis
- In $f : A \to B$
	- The range is the set of actual outputs that the function produces when applied to all elements of domain A. 
## Source[^1]
- 1. of a binary relation $R$, a subset of $S_{1} \times S_{2}$, say. The $$ subset of $S_{2}$ consisting of all elements to which some element of $S_{1}$ is related. If $R$ is the relation 'is the wife of' defined from men to women, the range of $R$ is the set of married women.

  

Since a function is a special kind of relation, the range of

f: X \rightarrow Y



  

can be written as

  

2. See MEASURES OF VARIATION.

## Source[^2]
- The difference between the largest and the smallest observed or possible values of a variable. The sample range is not usually a good measure of dispersion, as it makes use of only two observations, which may each be outliers.
