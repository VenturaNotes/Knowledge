- $n$. A cone-shaped set of points, radiating outwards from a location midway between an organism's ears, from which a sound source produces identical phase delays and transient disparities, making the use of such binaural cues useless for sound localization. Any cross-section of the cone represents a set of points that are equidistant from the left ear and equidistant from the right ear.
