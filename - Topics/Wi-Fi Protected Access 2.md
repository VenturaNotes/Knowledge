- Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) is an encrypted security measure added to wireless networks. WPA (wi-fi protected access) increases data protection on the network and provides more robust access control. As a result, only authorized users can use the wireless connection. The most recent version, WPA2, is available in two versions. The personal version requires a password setup, and the enterprise permits access through a server.
