- A plan to transform an organization's overall strategic objectives into operational deliverables. It involves the design of the product or service and the processes by which the product or service is produced; the way in which production is managed and controlled; and the design of processes for the constant improvement of the operation. If, at the strategic level, the organization decides to compete in the market on the basis of superior quality, the operations strategy has to plan to produce a package incorporating the specified quality within stated financial constraints. If the strategy is to compete on cost, the plan must produce the product cheaply within the limits of acceptable quality.
