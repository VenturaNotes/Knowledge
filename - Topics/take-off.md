- The stage of economic development at which an economy becomes capable of sustained growth in per capita income. An economy which has not reached take-off has saving and investment inadequate to do more than keep pace with population increase at low and stagnant levels of per capita income. Take-off requires sufficient saving for investment in infrastructure and productive equipment, as well as adequate credit and banking systems, and institutions capable of providing education and public order.
