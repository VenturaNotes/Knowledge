	- 2 million emails sent
- 4000 exabytes of data every second
	- This seems a little inaccurate. 0.11 exabytes per second is more accurate [^2]

- (Net) The global informal network that now links a very substantial fraction of the world's computer networks. The Internet is an extraordinary development that stems from the original ARPANET, which was initiated in North America in 1969. In broad terms the Internet does not offer services to end-users, but serves primarily to interconnect other networks on which end-user services are located. It provides basic services for file transfer, email, and remote login, and high-level services including the World Wide Web and the MBONE.
- The Internet is global, with connections to nearly every country in the world. It is deliberately nonpolitical and tends to deal with nongovernmental levels within a country. The structure is informal, with a minimal level of governing bodies and with an emphasis in these bodies on technical rather than on administration or revenue generation. Up to the mid-1990s the major users of the Internet were the academic and research communities, but thereafter, with a growth in home computing, there has been a massive increase in the number of individuals and companies using the World Wide Web and email. There has also been a large increase in interest in the commercial exploitation of the Internet. See ECOMMERCE.

- (the Net) A global communications system consisting of millions of computer networks interconnected by modems, telephone cables, wireless networks, and satellite links, with associated software controlling the movement of data. It offers facilities for accessing remote databases, transfer of data between computers, and e-mail. In addition, there are high-level services. MBONE (multicast backbone service), for example, allows transmission to more than one destination and is used for videoconferencing. The World Wide Web is a multimedia facility allowing pictures, sound, and video to be displayed. A particular feature of the Web is the availability of hyperlinks between pages and documents.
- Originally, the Internet was mainly used by the academic community, but the wider availability of personal computers led to an enormous growth in the number of individual users during the 1990s and 2000s: in 2003 it was estimated that some $77 \%$ of people in the developed world were Internet users. This has resulted in ever increasing commercial exploitation in such areas as electronic shopping, B2B trading, supply-chain management, home banking, financial services, advertising, marketing research, and customer contact (see DIGITAL ECONOMY). Recent developments include the growth of cloud computing, social media, and access to the Internet via mobile devices (smartphones and tablet computers). See also INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY.
