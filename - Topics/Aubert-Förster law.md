The proposition that the minimum size at which a stimulus such as a printed letter of the alphabet is just recognizable is directly proportional to its angular distance from the fixation (1) point or, equivalently, to the distance from the fovea of its projection on the retina. The law holds from 2 to 40 angular degrees. Compare Aubert-Förster Phenomenon. \[Named after the German physiologist and psychologist Hermann Ludimar (Rudolf) Aubert (1826-92) and the German ophthalmologist Carl Friedrich Richard Förster (1825-1902) who formulated it and published it briefly in 1856 and fully in 1857]
