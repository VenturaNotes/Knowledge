- $n$. a condition in which there is an imbalance between the nutrients the body receives and the nutrients it requires. A deficiency (or undernutrition) results from a combination of a decreased dietary intake, a decreased uptake by the body (malabsorption), an increase in bodily losses, and an increase in the body's requirements. Overnutrition is the consequence of dietary excess and results in obesity and other metabolic abnormalities, such as diabetes and hyperlipidaemia.
## Source[^2]
- The condition arising due to the lack of one or more of the nutrients that are required in the diet to maintain health. Malnutrition can result from a reduced intake of nutrients (undernourishment), an inability to use absorbed nutrients, failure to meet a required increase in nutrient intake, or nutrient losses. There are three stages in the process of malnutrition: first, the carbohydrate stores in the body are depleted; secondly, the fat reserves are metabolized (see FATTY-ACID OXIDATION); and finally, proteins are broken down to provide energy. Death may result after protein levels have been reduced to half their normal value. Kwashiorkor is a type of malnutrition that develops when the diet lacks proteins and hence essential amino acids. Malnutrition due to reduced absorption of nutrients in the intestine can develop with a cereal-based diet, due to sensitivity of the intestinal lining to gluten, a protein found in cereals. See also MINERAL DEFICIENCY.
