- $n$. a condition in which there is an imbalance between the nutrients the body receives and the nutrients it requires. A deficiency (or undernutrition) results from a combination of a decreased dietary intake, a decreased uptake by the body (malabsorption), an increase in bodily losses, and an increase in the body's requirements. Overnutrition is the consequence of dietary excess and results in obesity and other metabolic abnormalities, such as diabetes and hyperlipidaemia.
