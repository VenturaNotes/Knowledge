- a virus responsible for an acute infection in humans with features similar to those of Marburg disease. Transmission is by contact with infected blood and other body fluids and the incubation period is 2-21 days ( 7 days on average). The mortality rate is $53-88 \%$, but intensive treatment (including rehydration) in the early stages of the disease can halt its rapid and usually irreversible progression to haemorrhaging of internal organs. Until recently, sporadic but short-lived outbreaks have occurred in Africa since 1976, when the virus was first identified during an outbreak in the region of the Ebola river, in Za√Øre (now Democratic Republic of Congo). A major epidemic of the disease broke out in West Africa at the end of 2013 and lasted until May 2016: over 11,000 people died. An unknown species of animal - possibly a fruit bat - is assumed to act as a reservoir for the virus between outbreaks of the disease in humans.
