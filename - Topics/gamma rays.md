- ionizing electromagnetic radiation of short wavelength given off by certain radioactive substances with equivalent properties to artificially produced X-rays. Gamma rays used in nuclear medicine tend to have higher energy than diagnostic X-rays, with greater penetration; they are harmful to living tissues and can be used to sterilize certain materials and to kill bacteria as a means of food preservation. Higher energies are used in radiotherapy with sufficient energy to kill tumor cells by causing breaks in DNA strands.
