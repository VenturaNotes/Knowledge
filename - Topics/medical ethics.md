- the standards of conduct required of medical professionals and also the academic study of ethical issues arising from the practice of medicine. From the Hippocratic oath onwards, standards are designed to reassure that professionals subscribing to them will act in the best interests of, and will avoid harming, their patients. Today they lay greater emphasis on patient autonomy, while the contemporary study of medical ethics is concerned with a great variety of complex societal and social issues related to medical practice and research. Medical ethics is now taught in all medical schools in the UK as an essential part of a professional training, and the wider field of bioethics is becoming a recognized academic specialty.
