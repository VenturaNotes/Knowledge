- $n$. an infestation of the bile ducts and liver with the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica. Humans acquire the infection through eating wild watercress on which the larval stages of the parasite are present. The symptoms include fever, dyspepsia, vomiting, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and coughing; the liver may also be extensively damaged (causing liver rot). Anthelmintics are used in the treatment of fascioliasis.
