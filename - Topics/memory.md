- A device or medium that can retain information for subsequent retrieval. The term is synonymous with storage and store, although it is most frequently used for referring to the internal storage of a computer that can be directly addressed by operating instructions. See also CACHE, MAIN MEMORY, MEMORY HIERARCHY, MEMORY MANAGEMENT, SEMICONDUCTOR MEMORY.

- The means by which information is stored in the brain. The exact mechanism of processing and storing information is not known but is thought to involve the construction of circuits of neurons in the cerebral cortex, which are strengthened by repeated use (see SYNAPTIC PLASTICITY). Various models of memory have been proposed, with different types of information and levels of processing. One model proposes three principal forms of memory based on duration. Sensory memory is the fleeting retention of stimuli perceived by the senses. These memories are almost immediately lost unless attention is paid to them, when they enter short-term memory (or 'working memory'). This lasts for up to a minute or so. With effort, for example repetition of a phone number, the information may then enter long-term memory, where it can remain for hours, days, or even years. The subsequent conscious recollection of things or facts involves explicit (declarative) memory, whereas implicit memory concerns motor skills, such as the ability to ride a bike, and conditioned reflexes. The transfer of short-term memory to long-term memory involves the limbic system, in particular the hippocampus. It is thought that connections in the hippocampus are necessary for consolidating and accessing short-term memory but not for recalling long-term memories. The amygdala is instrumental in producing fear and fear memories. Memory is essential to the processes of learning and recognition of individuals and objects.
