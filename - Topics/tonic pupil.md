- (Adie's pupil) a pupil that is dilated as a result of damage to the nerves supplying the ciliary muscle and iris. It reacts poorly to light but may constrict better for near vision, with slow redilation on refixation at a distance. The tonic pupil is sensitive to dilute $0.1 \%$ pilocarpine drops, which cause marked constriction but have little effect on a normal pupil. The tonic pupil may become miotic (see MIOSIS) over time.
