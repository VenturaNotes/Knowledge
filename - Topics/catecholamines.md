- pl. n. a group of physiologically important substances, including adrenaline, noradrenaline, and dopamine, having various different roles (mainly as neurotransmitters) in the functioning of the sympathetic and central nervous systems. Chemically, all contain a benzene ring with adjacent hydroxyl groups (catechol) and an amine group on a side chain. Catecholamines act at both alpha $(\alpha)$ and beta $(\beta)$ adrenoceptors. Some tumours (e.g. phaeochromocytoma) secrete excess catecholamines.
