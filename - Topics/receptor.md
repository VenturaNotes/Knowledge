- (1) a cell or group of cells specialized to detect changes in the environment and trigger impulses in the sensory nervous system. All sensory nerve endings act as receptors, whether they simply detect touch, as in the skin, or chemical substances, as in the nose and tongue, or sound or light, as in the ear and eye. See EXTEROCEPTOR; INTEROCEPTOR; MECHANORECEPTOR; PROPRIOCEPTOR. 
- (2) a specialized area of a cell membrane, consisting of a specially adapted protein, that can bind with a specific hormone (e.g. oestrogen receptors), neurotransmitter (e.g. adrenoceptors), drug, or other chemical, thereby initiating a change within the cell.
