- A plant life form in Raunkiaer's system of classification (see PHYSIOGNOMY). Phanerophytes are large shrubs and trees in which the overwintering (perennating) buds are located high above the ground. The buds are thus at risk of exposure to drought stress or frost, and such plants occur mainly in regions where frost and drought are uncommon, such as the tropics.
