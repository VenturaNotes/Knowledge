- a test for phaeochromocytomas not displaying typically high levels of plasma catecholamines. An intravenous bolus of glucagon is administered and the test is positive when there is a threefold increase in plasma catecholamine levels with a consequent rise in blood pressure. The test is now very rarely used due to safer and more sensitive screening tests, combined with modern tumor imaging techniques.
