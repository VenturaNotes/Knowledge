- A measure of the degree of asymmetry of the distribution of a random variable; the standardized third moment of the distribution, defined as$$\gamma=E\left[(X-\mu)^{3}\right] / \sigma^{3}$$where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the standard deviation. For a symmetrical distribution $\gamma=0$ and the median of the distribution equals its mean. In a distribution with positive skewness the median is below the mean, and with negative skewness the median is above the mean. For example, the empirical distribution of income across the population in both developed and less developed countries exhibits positive skewness: a large proportion of income accrues to a small proportion of the population.
