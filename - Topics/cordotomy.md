- $n$. a surgical procedure for the relief of severe and persistent pain in the pelvis or lower limbs. The nerve fibres that transmit the sensation of pain to consciousness pass up the spinal cord in special tracts (the spinothalamic tracts). In cordotomy the spinothalamic tracts are severed in the cervical (neck) region.
