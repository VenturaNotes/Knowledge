- $n$. A type of sensory receptor that is associated with olfaction and that responds to aromatic substances drawn into the upper nasal cavity, where molecules bind to bipolar neurons in the olfactory epithelium, specialized for specific kinds of odours, whose axons are part of the olfactory nerve, and the bipolar neurons respond by generating nerve impulses and transmitting them to the olfactory bulbs. Also called an osmoreceptor, though that usage is ambiguous.
