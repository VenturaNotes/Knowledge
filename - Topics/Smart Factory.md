- Smart factories are also known as “digital” or “intelligent” factories, but all of these terms refer to a specific environment that relies on automation and self-optimization to improve and streamline manufacturing operations. This involves interconnecting various machines and devices so that they work in unison to complete a project. These processes are completed without intervention from human employees, although smart factories are overseen by human managers.
