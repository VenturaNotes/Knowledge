- The set of characteristics of jobs that workers engaged in job search are willing to accept. Acceptance depends on pay, prospects, working conditions, and location. If workers are searching while unemployed, their job acceptance schedules are liable to change: typically they become willing to accept lower pay or worse working conditions, and more willing to accept a change in location or type of work, as unemployment lowers both their expectations and their liquidity.
