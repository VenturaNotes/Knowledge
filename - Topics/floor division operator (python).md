## Synthesis
- The floor division operator in python is `//` which is also known as integer division
- Divides two numbers and rounds down to nearest whole number
- `a // b == math.floor(a/b)`
- Very commonly used in algorithms like [[binary search]]
	- `mid = left + (right - left) // 2`
### Examples
- `7//2 = 3 (3.5 is floored to 3 and is of type int)`
- `-7 // 2 = -4 (-3.5 is floored to -4 and is of type int)`
- `-7.0 // 2 = 3.0 (returns a float here and is of type float)`
