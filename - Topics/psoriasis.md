- $n$. a chronic disease in which scaly pink patches form on the elbows, knees, scalp, and other parts of the body. Psoriasis is one of the commonest skin diseases in Britain, affecting about $2 \%$ of the population, although many mild cases are undiagnosed. The most common time of onset is in adolescence. It may occur in association with arthritis (see PSORIATIC ARTHRITIS), and severe psoriasis is associated with a higher risk of diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular disease. The disease may be very severe, affecting much of the skin and causing considerable disability and psychological stress. Psoriasis is partly of genetic origin with polygenic influences. Exacerbations of psoriasis may be associated with streptococcal infection and drugs such as lithium and beta blockers.
- There is no cure, but first-line treatments include coal tar, dithranol, and topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues (e.g. calcipotriol). Narrow-band UVB or PUVA can also be effective as can systemic therapies, such as methotrexate, retinoids, and ciclosporin. Biological treatments, such as infliximab, adalimumab, and etanercept, are potent but expensive.
