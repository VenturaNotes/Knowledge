- In financial terms, variance is the difference between planned and actual expenses or revenue. If revenue is higher than expected for a particular product line, that is known as favorable variance and indicates better-than-expected performance. In contrast, if revenue is lower than expected or costs are higher, that is called unfavorable variance.
