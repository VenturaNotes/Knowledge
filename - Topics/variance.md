- In financial terms, variance is the difference between planned and actual expenses or revenue. If revenue is higher than expected for a particular product line, that is known as favorable variance and indicates better-than-expected performance. In contrast, if revenue is lower than expected or costs are higher, that is called unfavorable variance.

- (1) In standard costing and budgetary control, the difference between the standard or budgeted levels of cost or income for an activity and the actual costs incurred or income achieved. If the actual performance is better than standard then a favorable variance results, while if actual performance is worse than standard there is an adverse variance. Adverse variances may be subjected to detailed analysis in order to pinpoint their precise causes. See analysis of variance. 
- (2) In statistics, a measure of the dispersion (spread) of a distribution of outcomes. It is the square of the standard deviation.

- A measure of dispersion of probability distribution. The population variance of a random variable $X$ is $\operatorname{Var}(X)=E\left[(X-E[X])^{2}\right]$, where $E$ denotes expected value. The sample variance of a set of $N$ observations $\left\{x_{i}\right\}, i=1,2, \ldots, N$, is given by$$V=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N}\left(x_{i}-\mu\right)^{2},$$where $\mu$ is the sample mean. See also COVARIANCE MATRIX.
