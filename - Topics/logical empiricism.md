- $n$. An influential approach to the philosophy of science, less radical than logical positivism, associated especially with the writings of three US philosophers of science, namely the German-born Rudolph Carnap (1891-1970), the Czechoslovakian-born Ernest Nagel (1901-85), and the German-born Hans Reichenbach (1891-1953), according to which the aim of research in both the natural and social sciences is the discovery and justification (testing) of general laws, a sharp distinction being drawn between the context of discovery and the context of justification. See also EMPIRICISM, FALSIFIABILITY.
