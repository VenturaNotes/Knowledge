- (perpetuity) The receipt or payment of a constant annual amount in perpetuity. Although the word annuity refers to an annual sum, in practice the constant sum may be for periods of less than a year. The present value of an annuity is obtained from the formula:$$P=(a \times 100) / i$$where $P$ is the present value, $a$ is the annual sum, and $i$ is the interest rate.
