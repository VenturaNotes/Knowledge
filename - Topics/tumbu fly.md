- a large non-bloodsucking fly, Cordylobia anthropophaga, widely distributed in tropical Africa. The female fly lays its eggs on ground contaminated with urine or excreta or on clothing tainted with sweat or urine. The maggots are normally parasites of rats, but if they come into contact with humans they penetrate the skin, producing boil-like swellings (see also MYIASIS). The maggots can be gently eased out by applying oil to the swellings.
