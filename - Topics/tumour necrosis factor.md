- (TNF) either of two proteins, TNF-$\alpha$ or TNF- $\beta$, that function as cytokines. Produced by macrophages, monocytes, T lymphocytes, and various other cells, they mediate many responses, including inflammation, and have a marked action against tumor cells. Anti-TNF drugs (see CYTOKINE INHIBITOR) are used in the treatment of several disorders, especially rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis.
