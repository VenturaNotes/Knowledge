- $n$. the traditional Chinese practice of applying a heated cup to the skin and allowing it to cool, which causes swelling of the tissues beneath and an increase in the flow of blood in the area. This is thought to draw out harmful excess blood from diseased organs nearby and so promote healing. In wet cupping the skin is previously cut, so that blood will flow into the cup and can be removed.
