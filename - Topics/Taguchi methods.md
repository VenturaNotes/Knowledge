- Methods of testing the design of a new product or service in the most extreme circumstances likely to occur. In theory, all possible design variables and combinations are investigated to achieve the optimum combination. In reality, this would be impossible; therefore a range of statistical techniques are used to determine the best combinations, leading to the lowest cost and the highest degree of uniformity. The methods were devised by Genichi Taguchi.
