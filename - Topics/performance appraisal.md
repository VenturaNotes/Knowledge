- A formal review of the performance of an employee. The results of the appraisal may be used in deciding an employee's pay or other rewards, career prospects, or training requirements. It usually involves an interview between the employee and his or her immediate manager, although in some cases there may be an element of self-appraisal.
- In most organizations, appraisal consists of assessing the employee's ability (or otherwise) to meet expected standards and his or her general demeanour as a member of the workforce. See also EMPLOYEE EVALUATION.
