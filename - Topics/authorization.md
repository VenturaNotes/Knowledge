- Authorization is a process that requires a form of proof to ensure that an individual or company is permitted to access a particular website, file, e-mail, or other application. This is used to secure the information that is provided within the resource. Within a business, this helps ensure that only authorized employees have access to senstitive information. While this process consists of basic forms of authorization, such as a password, it can also require more complex methods, such as biometrics. Essentially, the level of authorization required will increase along with the level of confidentiality the file or information contains.
