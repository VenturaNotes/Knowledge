- an investigation to seek evidence of cardiac ischaemia. The heart is stressed by exercise or by the administration of an intravenous drug that increases heart rate (i.e. mimicked exercise). Ischaemia may then be detected by electrocardiography (stress ECG or exercise ECG), echocardiography (showing the development of impaired function in areas of heart muscle that are ischaemic), myocardial perfusion scan, or cardiac MRI.
