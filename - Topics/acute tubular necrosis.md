- (ATN) a condition caused by acute renal injury from either ischaemia or toxins and associated with tubular damage that is usually reversible. The earliest feature is isosthenuria, which may occur while there is still a high urine flow rate. This is followed by a reduction in glomerular filtration rate. Oliguria is common and dialysis often needed for survival. If the cause of the initial damage can be removed, recovery of renal function within six weeks can be expected in most cases.
