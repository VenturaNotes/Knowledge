- The term ‘macro’ is used in computer programming to describe a keyboard shortcut that allows users to simplify repetitive tasks and perform computing tasks efficiently. For instance, on a Windows operating system, a user can access the ‘cut’ macro by simultaneously pressing the ‘Ctrl’ button and the “X” button on their keyboard. This allows them to efficiently cut a piece of text or an image from the internet browser or a desktop application. Spreadsheet and word processing programs allow users to create custom macros that can be used to automate repetitive tasks.
