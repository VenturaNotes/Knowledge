- $n$. a rare manifestation of chronic or partially treated amoebic dysentery leading to the development of a nonmalignant inflammatory mass in the bowel. It can occur in the caecum, appendix, and rectosigmoid area in descending order of frequency. Amoebomas can cause symptoms of intestinal obstruction, weight loss, and low-grade fever. Colonic amoeboma with multiple amoebic liver abscesses can masquerade as colorectal carcinoma and liver metastases; imaging with ultrasound and CT scan is used to differentiate between these.
