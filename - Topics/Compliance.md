- Compliance is the process of meeting regulations and standards that are required by law or other authorities. The term is used in many industries, but it's most commonly associated with healthcare, with strict rules about patient privacy and confidentiality. For example, HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability Accountability Act) requires doctors to follow specific procedures when handling medical records so they don't disclose any personal patient information.
