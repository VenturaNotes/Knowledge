- The evaluation of a financial trading position using current market data. For example, when an investor makes a short sale the broker will calculate the position of the trade at the close of each trading day. If this process of marking-to-market reveals a deterioration in the position the broker may request additional margin to cover potential losses. See also SHORT SELLING.
