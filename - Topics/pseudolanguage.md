- (pseudocode) A form of representation used to provide an outline description of the specification for a software module. Pseudolanguages contain a mixture of natural language expressions embedded in syntactic structures taken from programming language (such as IF..THEN..ELSE). The formality of the definition varies from ad hoc (e.g. defined within a project team) to being sufficiently formal to enable automatic parsing and syntax checking (e.g. supported by a CASE tool).
- Pseudolanguages are not intended to be executed by computer; they must be interpreted by people.
