- In game theory, any generalized situation which is essentially similar to the following: two prisoners are interviewed separately about a crime. If both deny the charge, there is enough evidence to convict them of a minor charge. If one confesses and implicates the other, who denies it, then the first will be released and the other will be heavily punished. If both confess, then both receive a medium punishment. The ‘dilemma’ for either prisoner is that denying the charge can result in either a minor conviction or the worst possible outcome depending on the action of the other prisoner. See NASH EQUILIBRIUM.
