- obstruction of the pulmonary artery or one of its branches by an embolus, usually a blood clot derived from phlebothrombosis of the leg veins (deep vein thrombosis). Large pulmonary emboli result in acute heart failure or sudden death. Smaller emboli cause death of sections of lung tissue, pleurisy, and haemoptysis (coughing of blood). Minor pulmonary emboli respond to the anticoagulant drugs heparin and warfarin. Major pulmonary embolism is treated by embolectomy or by dissolution of the blood clot with an infusion of streptokinase. Recurrent pulmonary embolism may result in pulmonary hypertension.
