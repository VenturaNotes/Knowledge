- (radioautography) $n$. a technique for examining the distribution of a radioactive tracer in the tissues of an experimental animal. The tracer is injected into the animal, which is killed after a certain period. Thin sections of its organs are placed in close contact with a radiation-sensitive material, such as a photographic emulsion, and observed under a microscope. Blackening of the film indicates a high concentration of radioactive material.
## Source[^2]
- An experimental technique in which a radioactive specimen is placed in contact with (or close to) a photographic plate, so as to produce a record of the distribution of radioactivity in the specimen. The film is darkened by the ionizing radiation from radioactive parts of the sample. Autoradiography is used to study the distribution of particular substances in living tissues, cells, and cultures. A radioactive isotope of the substance is introduced into the organism or tissue, which is killed, sectioned, and examined after enough time has elapsed for the isotope to be incorporated into the substance. Another common application of autoradiography is the location of radioactively labelled DNA probes or antibodies employed in such techniques as Southern blotting and western blotting.
