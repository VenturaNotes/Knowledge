- The dark-colored amorphous colloidal material that constitutes the organic component of soil. It is formed by the decomposition of plant and animal remains and excrement (see LITTER) and has a complex and variable chemical composition. Being a colloid, it can hold water and therefore improves the water-retaining properties of soil; it also enhances soil fertility and workability. Acidic humus (mor) is found in regions of coniferous forest, where the decay is brought about mainly by fungi. Alkaline humus (mull) is typically found in grassland and deciduous forest: it supports an abundance of microorganisms and small animals (e.g. earthworms).
