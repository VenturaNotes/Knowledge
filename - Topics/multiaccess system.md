- A system allowing several users to make apparently simultaneous use of the computer. Each user has a terminal, typically a keyboard plus VDU display, and is connected via a multiplexer or front-end processor to the main system. As individual users type their commands, the system will multiprogram among the several users of the system, each command being processed as it is received. See also TIME SHARING.
