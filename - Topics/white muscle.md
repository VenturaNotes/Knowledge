- A type of muscle tissue consisting of glycolytic fast-twitch fibers specialized for rapid contraction. In fish white muscles are used for fast swimming movements and for escape reactions. They lie deeper in the body than the red muscles used for slow swimming and are arranged in a helical pattern rather than parallel with the body axis. This arrangement produces marked body curvature when they contract.
