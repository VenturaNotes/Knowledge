- $n$. the organ of olfaction, which also acts as an air passage that warms, moistens, and filters the air on its way to the lungs. The external nose is a triangular projection in the front of the face that is composed of cartilage and covered with skin. It leads to the nasal cavity (internal nose), which is lined with mucous membrane containing olfactory cells and is divided into two chambers (fossae) by the nasal septum. The lateral wall of each chamber is formed by the three scroll-shaped nasal conchae, below each of which is a groovelike passage (meatus). The paranasal sinuses open into these meatuses.
## Source[^2]
- The protuberance on the face of some vertebrates that contains the nostrils (see NARES) and part of the nasal cavity. It therefore forms part of the olfactory system (see OLFACTION) and the external opening of the respiratory system.
