- $n$. the organ of olfaction, which also acts as an air passage that warms, moistens, and filters the air on its way to the lungs. The external nose is a triangular projection in the front of the face that is composed of cartilage and covered with skin. It leads to the nasal cavity (internal nose), which is lined with mucous membrane containing olfactory cells and is divided into two chambers (fossae) by the nasal septum. The lateral wall of each chamber is formed by the three scroll-shaped nasal conchae, below each of which is a groovelike passage (meatus). The paranasal sinuses open into these meatuses.
