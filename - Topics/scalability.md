- The ability for something designed to operate at one measure of size to operate successfully at other sizes. The term is commonly used in relation to the development of shared computer applications that are intended to be used by large numbers of users. Of necessity, developments take place with a small number of test users. Unless the application is carefully designed to take account of the interactions that will arise when it is called on to service a large number of users, it may well fail to operate at all, or to operate only with an unacceptable level of service. An application that successfully expands its numbers of supported users is said to be [[scalable]].
## Source[^2]
- Scalability is a term used to determine a system's potential to grow. Whether it's hardware, software, infrastructure, or an app, demands often change and increase over time. The scalability of a system is how well it can keep up with such demands, and whether or not various aspects need to be upgraded over time to ensure that the performance remains adequate.

- (1) The potential for a business to replicate its activities on a wider scale, thereby increasing its customer base, without disproportionate increase in cost or diminution in quality. In retail businesses the term generally refers to the ability to add sales channels or outlets. 
- (2) In computer systems, the ability of a network to handle a larger number of users.
