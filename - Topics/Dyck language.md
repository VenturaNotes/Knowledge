- A concept used in formal language theory. Let $\Sigma$ be the alphabet $$\{a_1, ..., a_n,b_1,...,b_n\}$$
- The Dyck language over $\Sigma$ is the set of all strings that can be reduced to the empty string $\Lambda$ by 'cancellations' of the form $$a_ib_i \to \Lambda$$
- For example, $$\Sigma = \{(,)\}$$gives the Dyck language of all balanced parentheses strings. An important theorem characterizes the context-free languages as representable as the homomorphic image (see Homomorphism) of the intersection of a Dyck language and a regular language
