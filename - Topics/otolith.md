- A gelatinous mass containing a high concentration of particles of calcium carbonate, which forms part of the macula of the inner ear.
## Source[^2]
- (otoconium) n. one of the small particles of calcium carbonate associated with a macula in the saccule or utricle of the inner ear.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any of the tiny crystals of calcium carbonate, with a density of 2.95 grams per cubic centimetre, almost three times the density of water, in the utricle and saccule within the vestibular system of a vertebrate animal, playing an important part in the vestibular system of the inner ear, responsive to linear acceleration, and partly responsible for the sense of balance and orientation. Linear acceleration of the head causes the hair cells embedded in the otolith receptor to move with it, but the dense otoliths resist acceleration and tend to hold the gelatinous membrane stationary, causing the hair cells that protrude into the membrane to bend backwards and trigger adjacent neurons to transmit nerve impulses to the brainstem and cerebellum. The otolith organs are also responsive to gravity, which according to the general theory of relativity formulated by the German-born US physicist Albert Einstein (1879-1955) is equivalent to accelerating an object upwards at 9.8 metres per second squared. Also called a statolith. See also saccule, statocyst. Compare endolymph. \[From Greek ous, otos an ear + lithos a stone]
