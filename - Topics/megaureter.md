- $n$. gross dilatation of the ureter. This occurs above the site of a long-standing obstruction in the ureter, which blocks the free flow of urine from the kidney. A common cause of megaureter is reflux of urine from the bladder into the ureters (see VESICOURETERIC REFLUX), but some of the most striking examples are found in so-called idiopathic megaureter. In this condition, which may affect one or both ureters, there is a segment of normal ureter of varying length at the extreme lower end of the bladder, above which the ureter is enormously dilated. Both reflux and idiopathic megaureter can be complicated by urinary infection and/or renal impairment. Treatment of megaureter is by corrective surgery if functional obstruction can be demonstrated. Surgery for reflux is normally reserved for children with gross reflux distending the renal pelvis and is usually carried out in the first few months of life.
