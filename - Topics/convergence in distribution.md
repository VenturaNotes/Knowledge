- (weak convergence) A sequence of random variables $x_{1}, \ldots, x_{n}, \ldots$ with corresponding distribution functions $F_{1}(x), \ldots F_{n}(x), \ldots$ converges in distribution (or weakly) to the random variable $x$ with distribution function $F(x)$ if the sequence of the corresponding distribution functions converges to $F$ at all continuity points of $F$$$x_{n} \xrightarrow{d} x \Leftrightarrow \lim _{n \rightarrow \infty}\left|F_{n}(x)-F(x)\right|=0 \Leftrightarrow\left|F_{n}(x)-F(x)\right|<\varepsilon$$for every $\varepsilon>0$ starting from some $n$. The distribution given by $F(x)$ is called the limiting or the asymptotic distribution of $x_{n}$. This concept allows the approximation of the unknown distribution $F_{n}(x)$ of an estimator or a test statistic with a known asymptotic distribution $F(x)$. If $x$ is a constant the limiting distribution is degenerate, i.e. collapses to a single point. In this case (but not in general) convergence in distribution also implies convergence in probability.
