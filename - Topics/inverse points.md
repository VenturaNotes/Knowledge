- Given a circle with center $O$ and radius $r$, two points $A$ and $B$ are inverse points if $O$, $A$, and $B$ are collinear and $|OA||OB| = r^2$. Inversion$\textemdash$the map taking a point to its inverse point$\textemdash$has various theories associated with it; for example, inversion preserves angles (though it reverses the sense of the angle) and also maps a circle or line not through $O$ to a circle.
