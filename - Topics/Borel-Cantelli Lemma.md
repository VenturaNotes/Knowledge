- A general result in measure theory that is a particularly useful application when applied to a probability measure. If $\left\{A_{n}\right\}$ is an infinite sequence of measurable sets, where the sum of the measures $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \mu\left(A_{n}\right)$ is finite, then the set of points which lie in an infinite number of the sets must have measure zero. If the $A_{n}$ are events in a probability space, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is zero. A related result shows that if the events are independent and the sum of their probabilities is infinite, then the probability that infinitely many of the events occur is one.
