- $n$. an event with symptoms that mimic an epileptic seizure but that does not involve abnormal discharges of cortical neurons that would be captured on an EEG. It can be caused by both physiological and psychological conditions. Physiological causes include syncopes, cataplexy, migraine, narcolepsy, parasomnias, and tics. Psychological nonepileptic seizures, also known as psychogenic non-epileptic seizures, can arise from acute distress or anxiety or in the context of a somatic symptom. People who suffer from epilepsy may have non-epileptic seizures as well. The main visible difference between a non-epileptic seizure and an epileptic seizure is that the former commonly lasts longer than two minutes and can last up to 30 minutes. Also there is occasional pelvic thrusting, the patient's eyes and mouth are typically closed, and side-to-side head movements are more common than in epileptic seizures. Crying or talking during the attack is possible. There is no postictal phase. Other names for non-epileptic seizures include pseudo seizures, functional seizures, and conversion seizures.
