- $n$. drainage of urine from the kidney by a tube (catheter) passing through the kidney into the renal pelvis via the skin surface. The procedure is performed by a urologist or an interventional radiologist, often under ultrasound guidance. This is commonly used as a temporary procedure to alleviate renal obstruction. Long-term urine drainage by nephrostomy may be complicated by the attendant problems of infection and obstruction of the catheter by debris. Nephrostomy is also performed to enable the passage of a nephroscope.
