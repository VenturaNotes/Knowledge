- An immersive learning environment (ILE) is a digital learning method that involves interactive techniques and tools to train and educate employees. These techniques and tools include game-based learning, virtual 3D worlds, augmented reality, and simulation-based learning. By simulating real-world scenarios, an ILE gives learners opportunities to learn practical skills and interact with other learners in artificial environments before applying these skills to their jobs.
