- (microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration) the removal of spermatozoa from the epididymis by needle aspiration. This procedure, performed under anaesthetic, may be undertaken to assist conception in cases where the normal passage of sperm from the testis is obstructed, for example by blockage (through infection) of the ducts or by vasectomy. The extracted sperm are subjected to special treatment to select the strongest and most motile; these are then chemically treated to activate them and used for in vitro fertilization (see ICSI).
