- A period of temporary work, typically undertaken by a student or recent graduate, that allows a person to gain experience and insight into a particular industry or profession by working at a junior level. Internships usually last for a few months only and do not guarantee future employment; the intern may be paid or unpaid. The practice of offering unpaid internships has been criticized as exploitative and for allowing wealthier young people greater employment opportunities.
