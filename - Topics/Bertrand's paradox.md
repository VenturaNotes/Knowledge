- For a given circle, the mean length of a chord, chosen at random, is not well defined. This paradox results from the fact that there are several reasonable ways of randomly choosing a chord that lead to different answers. Bertrand highlighted this issue to show that the specific method of choosing randomly was needed for a probability to be well defined.
