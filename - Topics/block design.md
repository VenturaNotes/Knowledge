- An experimental design where experimental units with similar characteristics are grouped together as a block and treated as though they are indistinguishable. Repeated measures designs are an example where the same individual is subject to measurement under different experimental treatments. A balanced block design requires the blocks to be the same size and each experimental treatment to be applied the same number of times. A completely balanced block design further requires each treatment to be applied the same number of times within each block.
