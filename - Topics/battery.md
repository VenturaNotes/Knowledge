- $n$. (in law) the wrongful touching of another person, which may be a criminal offense or a tort in civil law (the latter is known as trespass against the person). Any intentional touching of another is a potential battery unless it occurs with the consent of the person involved. Consent therefore provides a defence against a charge of battery brought in relation to medical treatment.
