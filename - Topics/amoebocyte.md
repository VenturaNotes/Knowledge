- An animal cell whose location is not fixed and is therefore able to wander through the body tissues. Amoebocytes are named after their resemblance, especially in their movement, to amoebas (see AMOEBOID MOVEMENT), and they feed on foreign particles (including invading bacteria). They occur, for example, in sponges and mammalian blood (e.g. some leucocytes).
