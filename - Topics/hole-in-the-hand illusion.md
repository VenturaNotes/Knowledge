- $n$. A visual illusion produced by holding a tube to the right eye, placing the edge of the left hand against the far end of the tube, and looking at a distant object or surface with both eyes open, whereupon the left hand appears to have a circular hole through it. A cardboard tube from the middle of a roll of kitchen towel or foil is ideal for this demonstration. The illusion, which results from binocular rivalry, was first described in print in 1871 in the Philosophical Magazine by the US physician and geologist Joseph LeConte (1823-1901).
