- Human capital management (HCM) is best defined as people resource management. It is a method of converting several different standard HR practices into one streamlined process that focuses on meeting the needs of people in the organization. By investing in employees throughout their life-cycle with the company (from recruitment to retirement), companies find that their employees have a more consistent experience and are more productive. Through the use of technology like HCM software, HR departments can apply this method to processes such as recruitment and training.
