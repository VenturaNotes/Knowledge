- Non-toxic chemicals widely used as coolants in refrigeration and air conditioning, and as propellants in aerosols. The Dupont brand name for several CFCs is freon. It has been discovered that the effect of CFCs in the stratosphere is to deplete the ozone layer, posing a worldwide threat to health through admitting increased solar radiation. An international agreement to reduce their use was reached in the Montreal Protocol in 1987; since then emissions of CFCs around the developed world have largely ceased.
