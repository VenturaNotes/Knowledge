## Source [^1]
- Non-toxic chemicals widely used as coolants in refrigeration and air conditioning, and as propellants in aerosols. The Dupont brand name for several CFCs is freon. It has been discovered that the effect of CFCs in the stratosphere is to deplete the ozone layer, posing a worldwide threat to health through admitting increased solar radiation. An international agreement to reduce their use was reached in the Montreal Protocol in 1987; since then emissions of CFCs around the developed world have largely ceased.
## Source[^2]
- (CFCs) Compounds obtained by replacing the hydrogen atoms of hydrocarbons by chlorine and fluorine atoms. Their high stability to temperature makes them suitable for a variety of uses, including aerosol propellants, oils, polymers, etc. They are often known as freons. Their former widespread use in aerosols and refrigerator coolants led to increased concentrations in the upper atmosphere, where photochemical reactions cause them to break down and react with ozone, which results in depletion of the ozone layer. They also contribute to the greenhouse effect. For this reason CFCs have now largely been replaced with less damaging alternatives, such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). See also POLLUTION.
