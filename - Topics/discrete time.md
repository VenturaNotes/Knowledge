- The representation of time in a dynamic economic model as a discrete variable with time periods $t=0,1,2,3, \ldots$. Processes in discrete time are described by difference equations that determine the evolution of the system from period $t$ to period $t+1$. This can be contrasted with the treatment of time as a continuous variable, where processes are described by differential equations. See also CONTINUOUS TIME.
