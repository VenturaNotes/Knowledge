A typical word-processing system consists of a personal computer running a word-processing program, and an associated printer, such as an inkjet printer, capable of producing high-quality output of many different text fonts as well as diagrams and pictures.

The following features are generally provided. $\beta$ Document creation and editing, including the ability to
	- insert, delete, copy, and move text around in a document;
	- include text and/or graphics from other files;
