- A product that is marketed throughout the world with the same brand name, such as Coca Cola, Guinness, Levi, and McDonalds. The advantage of a global product is that it usually enables an advertisement or image to be used worldwide. However, one drawback is that some advertising slogans do not travel well. For example, 'things come alive with Pepsi', when translated into Chinese, led the populace to believe that their ancestors would be brought back from the dead; the Vauxhall Nova encountered similar problems in Spain, where Nova means 'no go'.
