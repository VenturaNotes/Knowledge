- a condition in which sudden rapid destruction of red blood cells (see HAEMOLYSIS) causes acute renal failure due partly to obstruction of small arteries in the kidneys. The haemolysis also causes a reduction in the number of platelets, which can lead to severe haemorrhage. The syndrome may occur as a result of septicaemia following a respiratory or gastrointestinal infection (especially by pathogenic Escherichia coli), eclamptic fits in pregnancy (see ECLAMPSIA), or as a reaction to certain drugs. There may also be small sporadic outbreaks of the condition without any obvious cause.
