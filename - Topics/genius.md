- $n$. A person of exceptional intelligence or ability; also such exceptional intelligence or ability itself (Michelangelo's artistic genius). It was first investigated in psychology by the English explorer, amateur scientist, and psychologist Sir Francis Galton (1822-1911), who used eminence as the main criterion of genius in his book Hereditary Genius (1869). In later research in psychology, a permissive criterion such as an IQ score of 140 or above has often been used to define it, and in the influential Genetic Studies of Genius carried out from 1921 onwards by the US psychometrician Lewis M(adison) Terman (1877-1956) and his colleagues, the 'geniuses' were children with IQs above 135. Also called giftedness. geniuses pl. \[From Latin genius attendant spirit present from one's birth, innate ability or talent, from gignere, genitum to beget]
