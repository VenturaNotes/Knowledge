- A type of printer that prints a complete page of output in one cycle. It is generally a nonimpact printer, such as a laser or inkjet printer, in which the printing process requires continuous movement of the paper. The information for one page of output is usually accumulated within a buffer in the printer before the printing process is started. Compare LINE PRINTER, SERIAL PRINTER.
