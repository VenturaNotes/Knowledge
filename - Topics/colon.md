- $n$. the main part of the large intestine, which consists of four sections - the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colons (see illustration). The colon has no digestive function but it absorbs large amounts of water and electrolytes from the undigested food passed on from the small intestine. At intervals strong peristaltic movements move the dehydrated contents (faeces) towards the rectum. $\textemdash$colonic adj.
