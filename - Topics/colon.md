- $n$. the main part of the large intestine, which consists of four sections - the ascending, transverse, descending, and sigmoid colons (see illustration). The colon has no digestive function but it absorbs large amounts of water and electrolytes from the undigested food passed on from the small intestine. At intervals strong peristaltic movements move the dehydrated contents (faeces) towards the rectum. $\textemdash$colonic adj.

## Source[^2]
- The section of the vertebrate large intestine that lies between the caecum and the rectum. Its prime function is to absorb water and minerals from indigestible food residues passing from the small intestine, which results in the formation of faeces. In humans the colon contains the greatest abundance and diversity of all the intestinal microflora, with an estimated $10^{12}$ bacteria per gram (dry weight) of contents. These constitute a complex microbiome, with important protective, metabolic, and nutritional functions.
