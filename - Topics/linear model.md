- $n$. A mathematical model represented by a linear equation of the form $Y=b_{1} X_{1}+b_{2} X_{2}+\ldots+b_{n} X_{n}$, or by a system of such linear equations. The relationship between the variables in a linear equation is a straight line when plotted on a graph. In multiple regression, $Y$ represents the estimated value of the dependent variable, each of the $X_{i}$ represents a predictor variable, and the $b_{i}$ are regression coefficients or weights. If they are expressed as standardized regression coefficients, then they are represented by the Greek letter beta $(\beta)$ instead of $b$ and are called beta coefficients. See also bootstrapping.
