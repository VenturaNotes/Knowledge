- (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) Legislation enacted in the USA that removed the restrictions on banks undertaking securities business that had been imposed by the GlassSteagall Act 1933. It also empowered companies to set up financial holding companies to supply banking, insurance, and investment services. Critics of the Act have argued that these provisions contributed directly to the financial crisis of 2008.
