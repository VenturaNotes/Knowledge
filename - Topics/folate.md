- (pteroylglutamic acid) $n$. a B vitamin that is important in the synthesis of nucleic acids. The metabolic role of folate is interdependent with that of vitamin $\mathrm{B}_{12}$ (both are required by rapidly dividing cells) and a deficiency of one may lead to deficiency of the other. A deficiency of folate results in megaloblastic anaemia. Good sources of folate include liver, green leafy vegetables, brown rice, and fortified breakfast cereals. The RNI (see Dietary Reference Values) for adults is $200 ~\mu \mathrm{g} /$day. Women planning a pregnancy, and during the first trimester, should take a supplement of $400~ \mu \mathrm{g} /$day to prevent neural tube defects (e.g. spina bifida) and other congenital malformations (e.g. cleft lip and cleft palate) in the fetus.
