- A policy in which governments or central banks set interest rates in an attempt to influence the money supply. Higher rates of interest will reduce the demand for money, giving a downward impetus to output, employment and prices. Lower interest rates will have the opposite effect. Responsibility for interest-rate policy was restored to the Bank of England by the UK government in 1997. See MONETARY POLICY.
