- A strategy for playing a repeated game that is founded on the principle of retaliation. In a repeated prisoners' dilemma game the tit for tat strategy is to play {Don't confess} while your opponent plays {Don't confess}, but to play {Confess} the period after your opponent plays {Confess}. If the opponent switches back to {Don't confess}, so will the tit for tat strategy in the subsequent play. The strategy is very simple but has proved very successful in contests between different strategies. See also TRIGGER STRATEGY.
