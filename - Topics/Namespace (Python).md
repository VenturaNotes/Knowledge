## Synthesis
- #question I need some definitions and examples of namespaces. Like what exactly is a namespace? 
- It's a mapping from names to objects
- Similar to a dictionary that holds all the names defined in a particular scope, such as a module, function, or class
- Helps organizing and avoiding naming conflicts in code
	- #question How does it do this? Give an example please
