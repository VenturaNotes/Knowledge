- (tonus) The state of sustained tension in muscles that is necessary for the maintenance of posture. In a tonic muscle contraction, only a certain proportion of the muscle fibers are contracting at any given time; the rest are relaxed and recovering for subsequent contractions. The fibers involved in tone contract more slowly than the fast fibers used for rapid responses by the same muscle. The proportions of slow and fast fibres depend on the function of the muscle.
