- A transmission channel in which the information signal and the noise signal combine additively to form the output signal. In a q-ary linear channel, with a finite number, q, of amplitudes, the signals add modulo-q; in the binary case (q = 2), this has the same effect as an exclusive-OR operation between the signals..
