## Source [^1]
- A technique from artificial intelligence that attempts to solve new problems by using past experience. The main task involves matching problem details against a library of previous cases. The cases are stored together with solutions so that when the nearest case is located the corresponding solution can be adjusted to suit the current problem. There are many different approaches to the design of the matching process, the storage of the cases, and methods for modifying the retrieved solution to fit the current problem.
## Source[^2]
- Case-based reasoning, or CBR, is a technique in which an information system solves new problems based on similar past situations. CBR systems have four parts: retrieval, reuse, revise and retain, and generalize/specialize. Retrieval finds the most similar previous case, while reuse applies that case's solution to the current problem. Revise and retain updates data with the new experience gained. Generalizing or specializing one or more cases makes them suitable for reuse when no solved case matches well enough. Generalizing requires adding commonality among multiple cases, while specializing involves removing detail until the new case is similar to a known one.
