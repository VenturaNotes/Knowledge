## Source [^1]
- A technique from artificial intelligence that attempts to solve new problems by using past experience. The main task involves matching problem details against a library of previous cases. The cases are stored together with solutions so that when the nearest case is located the corresponding solution can be adjusted to suit the current problem. There are many different approaches to the design of the matching process, the storage of the cases, and methods for modifying the retrieved solution to fit the current problem.
