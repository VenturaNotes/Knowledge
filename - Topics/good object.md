- $n$. In psychoanalysis, a concept introduced by the British-based Austrian psychoanalyst Melanie Klein (1882-1960) to denote a part object or whole object as it appears in an infant's fantasies. According to Klein, the splitting of the object into a good object and a bad object is a defence against ambivalence and the anxiety that it generates, the first object to undergo splitting being the mother's breast. A person's handling of the good object and the bad object defines the four defensive techniques in the theory of mental disorders of the Scottish psychoanalyst W. Ronald D. Fairbairn (1889-1964). See also GOOD BREAST, IMAGO (1).
