- adj. having the property of being transparent to X-rays (i.e. allowing X-rays to pass through). Radiopacity (blocking X-rays) decreases with atomic number of the element. Radiolucent materials, such as beryllium, are used to construct windows in X-ray tubes to allow the X-rays to escape from the tube. Gases are relatively radiolucent to X-rays and can be used as a negative contrast medium in X-ray examinations, e.g. in double-contrast barium examinations of the bowel or carbon dioxide arteriography.
