- $n$. In analysis of variance (ANOVA), the property of having only main effects and no interaction effects and thus being represented by an additive model without multiplicative terms. In axiomatic measurement theory, a property of a quantitative attribute such that for any two levels of the attribute, a third always exists such that the greatest of the three levels is the sum of the other two. The absence of this property is called non-additivity. 
- additive adj.
