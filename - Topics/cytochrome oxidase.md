- An enzyme complex comprising the terminal two cytochromes (cytochromes $a$ and $a_{3}$) of the respiratory chain in the mitochondria (see ELECTRON TRANSPORT CHAIN). It is responsible for the reduction of oxygen, receiving two electrons from cytochrome $c$ (which precedes it in the chain) and combining them with two hydrogen ions and an oxygen atom to form water.
