- Continuous quality improvement (CQI) refers to a business's constant improvement of systemic processes, operations, safety, services, products, work environment, outcomes, and regulatory compliance. The improvement of processes could be either gradual or a sudden breakthrough. CQI is often considered a part of performance and quality improvement (PQI), which is a three-step process. The first step comprises pinpointing the issue and developing a problem statement. The second step aims at putting the problem into perspective within the current situation and developing a specific improvement target. The final step of the process involves a thorough analysis of the issue to identify the primary cause.
