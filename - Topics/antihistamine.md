- $n$. a drug that inhibits the action of histamine by blocking specific histamine receptors. Four histamine receptors have been identified $\left(\mathrm{H}_{1}\right.$ to $\left.\mathrm{H}_{4}\right)$. $\mathbf{H}_{1}$-receptor antagonists are used for symptomatic relief of allergic conditions, such as hay fever, pruritus (itching), and urticaria (nettle rash). Many $\mathrm{H}_{1}$-receptor antagonists, e.g. cyclizine and promethazine, also have a strong antiemetic activity and are used to prevent motion sickness. The most common side-effect of these drugs, especially the older antihistamines (e.g. alimemazine, promethazine), is drowsiness and because of this they are sometimes used for sedation. Newer antihistamines, e.g. cetirizine, loratidine, mizolastine, are less sedating. Other side-effects include dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, digestive upsets, and lack of muscular coordination.
- $\mathrm{H}_{2}$ receptors are mainly found in the stomach, where stimulation by histamine causes secretion of acid gastric juice. $\mathbf{H}_{2}$-receptor antagonists (e.g. cimetidine, nizatidine, ranitidine, and famotidine) block these receptors and reduce gastric acid secretion; they are used in the treatment of functional dyspepsia, peptic ulcers, and gastro-oesophageal reflux disease. $\mathbf{H}_{3}$ - and $\mathbf{H}_{4}$-receptor antagonists have yet to find a clinical role.
## Source[^2]
- Any drug that inhibits the effects of histamine in the body and is therefore used to relieve and prevent the symptoms associated with allergic reactions, such as hay fever. Since one of the side-effects produced by antihistamines is sleepiness, some are used to prevent motion sickness and induce sleep.
## Source[^3]
- $n$. Any substance that counteracts the physiological and pharmacological effects of histamine, including non-prescription drugs that block histamine receptors without stopping the release of histamine and that are used for the treatment of allergies (including hay fever) and the prevention of motion sickness. antihistaminic adj.
