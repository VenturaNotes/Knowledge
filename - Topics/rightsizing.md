- The restructuring and rationalization of an organization to improve effectiveness and cut costs, without involving a full downsizing operation, which can often be overdone. Rightsizing could include increasing the size of an organization to meet increased demand, but it is more often used as a euphemism for moderate and controlled downsizing.
