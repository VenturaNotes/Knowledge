- (denationalization) The process of selling a publicly owned company or asset (see NATIONALIZATION) to the private sector. Privatization may be pursued for political as well as economic reasons. The economic justification for privatization is that a company will be more efficient under private ownership, although most economists would argue that privatization will only achieve this if it is accompanied by increased competition. Politically, privatization in the form of share offers to the general public is seen as a means of widening the share-owning public and thus increasing the commitment of working people to the capitalist system.

- The transfer to private ownership and control of assets or enterprises which were previously under public ownership. Privatized assets may have been under direct state ownership, or owned by local authorities, for example council houses in the UK, or by state-owned public corporations. Privatization may be adopted because of a belief that assets will be used more efficiently under private ownership, to reduce the power of central authorities, to raise revenue for the government, or to attempt to spread property ownership more widely in society.
