- This complex-sounding term actually denotes a standardized approach for dealing with certain types of local area networks (LANs). In any network, it's desirable to use as little power as possible. 6LoWPAN aims to improve the internet of things (IoT) by reducing the power cost across LANs. This means any short-range connections between devices, including Bluetooth and Wi-Fi connections. 6LoWPAN makes it possible for more devices, and smaller devices than ever, to connect to networks and the world wide web. Many devices that employ 6LoWPAN include digital assistants and smart thermostats.
