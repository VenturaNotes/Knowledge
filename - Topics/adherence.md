- $n$. the degree to which a patient follows medical advice. Medicines adherence refers specifically to taking medication (drug compliance) but adherence may also be applied to physiotherapy exercises or attending appointments for courses of therapy. Nonadherence falls into two broad categories: intentional nonadherence involves the patient making a decision not to follow medical advice; in unintentional nonadherence the patient forgets or misunderstands the advice.
