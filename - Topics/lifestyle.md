- The activities, interests, opinions, and values of individuals as they affect their mode of living. Lifestyle reflects more than social class or personality; it provides a profile of a person's whole pattern of behaviour and interaction with the world. Lifestyles are important in marketing because they influence the way in which people elect to make purchases. The technique for measuring lifestyle is part of psychographic segmentation. It involves measuring primary characteristics, known as AIO dimensions (activities, interests, and opinions). Lifestyle classifications have been developed out of this, particularly the Values and Lifestyles Typology (VALS), which classifies consumers into lifestyle groups. The current VALS system uses a questionnaire to classify people into eight segments according to their demographic characteristics and 'primary motivations'.
