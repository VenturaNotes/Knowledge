- An individual's personal interests and likes or dislikes, as revealed in answers to a standardized questionnaire or derived from his or her hobbies, leisure activities, etc. In personnel selection and vocational guidance, interest factors are seen as revealing stable personality traits and therefore as predictors of successful performance in a particular job or type of job. Interest tests, such as the Strong Interest Inventory and the Kuder Occupational Interest Survey, require participants to express their preferences among a range of activities, characteristics, and values; their answers can then be compared with the patterns of answers obtained from individuals who have proved successful in a particular occupation.
