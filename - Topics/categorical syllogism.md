## Source [^1]
- $n$. A conventional syllogism of the type introduced by the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384-322 BC), and used by almost all his successors, in which the propositions (1) are expressed in terms of category membership, using the four standard categorical proposition forms All S are P, No S are P, Some S are P, and Some S are not P. Examples of propositions that might be used in a categorical syllogism are All men are mortal, No wombats play tennis, Some thunderstorms are thrilling, and Some swans are not white. A categorical syllogism cannot express a logical argument containing non-categorical propositions such as Elizabeth is the mother of Charles. See also MODAL LOGIC.
