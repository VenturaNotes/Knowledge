- Prescriptive analytics is a form of data analytics that allows decision-makers to move raw data into prescriptive analytics software and garner valuable business intelligence about sales, marketing, customer service, financial management, project management, and other day-to-day tasks. These programs use tools and techniques such as heuristics, simulation, neural networks, graph analysis, recommendation engines, and machine learning that improve data analytics and generate more accurate metrics. An enterprise can then use these insights to share information with teams and enhance workflows and organizational structures.
