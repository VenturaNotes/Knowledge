- Digital finance refers to delivering traditional financial services withÂ digital technologies, such as computers, tablets, and smartphones. Digital finance provides access to financial services to underserved communities that lack physical infrastructure such as brick-and-mortar banks. Customers can carry out services over the internet instead of visiting a physical location. Digital finance, therefore, reaches more people than traditional financial services, thus helping service providers target new markets with modern technologies.
