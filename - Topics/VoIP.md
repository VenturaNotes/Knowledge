- Abbreviation for Voice over Internet Protocol. The use of a packet-switched network, in particular the Internet, to carry spoken communications. This has been a major growth area in recent years, with several companies offering services that not only allow conversations between their members but also connect to the global telephone network. Indeed, many traditional telephone providers now use VoIP internally. Implementing conversations in real time imposes special constraints because they are particularly sensitive to any delay or lost data.
