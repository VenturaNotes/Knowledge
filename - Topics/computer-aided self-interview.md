- (CASI) A method of interviewing in which the respondent interacts directly with the computer instead of through the interviewer. In theory, it is similar to a self-completion questionnaire and offers the same advantages (privacy and reduced interviewer bias). It is also called a computerized self-administered questionnaire (CSAQ).
