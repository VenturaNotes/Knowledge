- A device or system that is capable of carrying out a sequence of operations in a distinctly and explicitly defined manner. The operations are frequently numerical computations or data manipulations but also include input/output; the operations within the sequence may depend on particular data values. The definition of the sequence is called the program. A computer can have either a stored program or wired program. A stored program may exist in an alterable (read/write or RAM) memory or in a nonalterable (ROM) memory. Today, the term 'computer' without qualification is a synonym for 'stored-program digital computer.' See also aNALOGUE COMPUTER, DIGITAL COMPUTER, VON Neumann MACHINE.
