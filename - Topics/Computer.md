- A device or system that is capable of carrying out a sequence of operations in a distinctly and explicitly defined manner. The operations are frequently numerical computations or data manipulations but also include input/output; the operations within the sequence may depend on particular data values. The definition of the sequence is called the program. A computer can have either a stored program or wired program. A stored program may exist in an alterable (read/write or RAM) memory or in a nonalterable (ROM) memory. Today, the term 'computer' without qualification is a synonym for 'stored-program digital computer.' See also aNALOGUE COMPUTER, DIGITAL COMPUTER, VON Neumann MACHINE.

- Usually a digital electronic device that carries out logical and arithmetical calculations according to a very precise set of instructions contained within a program, known as software. It typically comprises a number of different components, though in laptop and handheld computers some of these may be contained within a single unit. These components are known as computer hardware and will include input devices such as keyboard, mouse, microphone for speech recognition software, or tablet and pen; a central processing unit which carries out the actual calculations; memory storage devices such as the working memory, the computer's hard disk drive; output devices such as a monitor and printer; and communication devices which allow computers to connect to one another or to the Internet.
