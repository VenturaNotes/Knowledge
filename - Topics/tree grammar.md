- A generalization of the notion of grammar, applying to trees (often called terms in this context) rather than strings (see TREE LANGUAGE). A regular tree grammar is the corresponding generalization of the notion of regular grammar. Productions have the form

  

$$

A \rightarrow t

$$

  

where $A$ is a nonterminal and $t$ a term, e.g.

  

$$

S \rightarrow h(a, g(S), b) \mid c

$$

  

These productions generate the regular tree language shown in the diagram. Note that the frontiers of these trees are the strings shown below each tree in the diagram. A set of strings is context-free if and only if it is the set of frontiers of the trees in a regular tree language.

The notion of context-free grammar can be similarly generalized. This time nonterminals can themselves be function symbols having an arbitrary number of arguments, e.g.

  

$$

\begin{aligned}

& F\left(x_{1}, x_{2}\right) \rightarrow \\

& f\left(x_{2}, F\left(x_{1}, g\left(x_{2}\right)\right)\right) \mid h\left(x_{1}, x_{1}, x_{2}\right)

\end{aligned}

$$

  

This means, for example, that $F(a, b)$ could be rewritten to

  

$$

f(b, F(a, g(b)))

$$

  

and then to

  

$$

f(b, f(g(b), F(a, g(g(b)))))

$$

  

and then to

  

$$

f(b, f(g(b), h(a, a, g(g(b)))))

$$
