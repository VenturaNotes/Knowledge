- $n$. surgical removal of the external genitals (see VULVA) of a woman. Simple vulvectomy involves excision of the labia majora, labia minora, and clitoris and is carried out for a nonmalignant growth. Radical vulvectomy is a much more extensive operation carried out for a malignant growth, e.g. cancer of the vulva. It involves wide excision of the labia majora and minora and the clitoris in addition to complete removal of all regional lymph nodes on both sides. The skin covering these areas is also removed, leaving an extensive raw area that is allowed to heal by granulation.
