- The branch of econometrics that has developed tools specifically designed to analyze microeconomic data, or the individual-level data on individuals, households, and firms. The methods include, in addition to the standard linear regression, various non-linear models for the analysis of the discrete or censored data, instrumental variables and differences-in-differences for isolation of causal effects, treatment evaluation, and analysis of stratified and clustered samples, and are usually applied to cross-sectional and panel data, including surveys. See also MACROECONOMETRICS.
