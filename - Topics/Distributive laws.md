- The two self-dual laws that are satisfied by all elements $x$, $y$, and $z$ in a Boolean algebra possessing the two operations $\land$ and $\lor$. In the first law the operation $\land$ is said to be distributive over the operation $\lor$, and vice versa for the second law
	- $x \land (y \lor z) = (x \land y) \lor (x \land z)$
	- $x \lor (y \land z) = (x \lor y) \land (x \lor z)$
