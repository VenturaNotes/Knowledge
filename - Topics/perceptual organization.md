## Synthesis
- The brain's active process of structuring raw sensory information into a meaningful, coherent whole, such as recognizing a complete object or scene from disparate visual elements.
	- Disparate can mean distinct or disconnected from one another. So disparate visual elements are visual parts that don't obviously belong together until the brain organizes them.
	- #question Why is this an active process and not a passive process? Are we aware when this occurs or does it happen automatically? 
	- The brain is taking separate, individual pieces of visual information (colors, edges, shapes, or light patterns) and organizing them into a unified perception (seeing a face, tree or building)
## Source [^1]
- The cues taken into account when perceptually organizing is
	- depth, form, motion, and constancy
		- #comment Constancy refers to the brain’s ability to perceive objects as stable and unchanging even when the sensory information about them changes — such as differences in lighting, distance, or angle.
			- Helps us maintain a consistent view of the world despite variations in sensory input.
		- #question What specifically is meant by form and constancy?
	- #question Are these all the cues?
