## Synthesis
- The brain's active process of structuring raw sensory information into a meaningful, coherent whole, such as recognizing a complete object or scene from disparate visual elements.
	- Disparate can mean distinct or disconnected from one another. So disparate visual elements are visual parts that don't obviously belong together until the brain organizes them.

	- It's an active process because the brain doesn't just passively receive sensory information. It actively works to structure and organize raw, disparate sensory inputs (like individual colors, edges, shapes, or light patterns) into a meaningful and coherent whole, such as recognizing a complete object or scene. This involves interpretation, grouping, and synthesis, rather than just a simple reception of data.

	- This process happens automatically and outside our conscious awareness. The brain organizes sensory information to allow us to perceive a unified object like a face, tree, or building without having to consciously piece together its individual elements. 
	- The brain is taking separate, individual pieces of visual information (colors, edges, shapes, or light patterns) and organizing them into a unified perception (seeing a face, tree or building)
## Organize

- The brain employs several organizational principles to process and make sense of sensory information, allowing us to perceive a coherent world. Many of these principles fall under the umbrella of **Gestalt principles of perceptual organization**, which describe how the brain groups individual elements into larger, meaningful wholes.

1.  **Gestalt Principles:** These are a set of principles that describe how the human brain naturally perceives objects as organized patterns and objects rather than as separate components.
    *   **Proximity:** Elements that are close to each other tend to be grouped together.
    *   **Similarity:** Elements that share similar characteristics (like color, shape, size, or orientation) tend to be grouped together.
    *   **Closure:** The brain tends to perceive incomplete figures as complete by filling in missing information.
    *   **Continuity:** Elements that form a continuous pattern or smooth curve are perceived as belonging together, rather than as separate, disjointed elements.
    *   **Common Fate:** Elements that move in the same direction or at the same speed are perceived as a single group.
    *   **Figure-Ground:** The brain organizes perception into an object of focus (the figure) and its background (the ground).
    *   **Symmetry:** Symmetrical elements tend to be perceived as belonging together.

2.  **Hierarchical Processing:** Sensory information is processed in a hierarchical manner, starting from basic features (like edges and lines in vision) in lower-level brain areas and progressing to more complex features and object recognition in higher-level areas.

3.  **Parallel Processing:** The brain processes multiple aspects of sensory information simultaneously. For example, when you see an object, your brain processes its color, shape, motion, and depth all at once, rather than sequentially.

4.  **Specialization and Localization:** Different areas of the brain are specialized for processing specific types of information or performing particular functions. For instance, the visual cortex is dedicated to visual processing, and within it, different sub-regions handle specific visual attributes.

5.  **Constancy:** As mentioned in your note, the brain maintains a consistent perception of objects despite changes in sensory input (e.g., an object's size, shape, or color appears constant even when lighting, distance, or viewing angle changes). This involves actively interpreting and adjusting for these variations.

6.  **Top-Down Processing:** The brain uses prior knowledge, expectations, and context to influence how it interprets sensory information. This allows for faster and more efficient perception, often filling in gaps or resolving ambiguities based on what we already know.

These principles demonstrate that perception is not a passive reception of data but an active, constructive process where the brain organizes, interprets, and synthesizes raw sensory input into a meaningful and coherent experience.

- The cues taken into account when perceptually organizing is
	- depth, form, motion, and constancy
		- #comment Constancy refers to the brain’s ability to perceive objects as stable and unchanging even when the sensory information about them changes — such as differences in lighting, distance, or angle.
			- Helps us maintain a consistent view of the world despite variations in sensory input.
		- #question What specifically is meant by form and constancy?
	- #question Are these all the cues?
