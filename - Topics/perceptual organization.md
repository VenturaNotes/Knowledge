## Synthesis
- The brain's active process of structuring raw sensory information into a meaningful, coherent whole, such as recognizing a complete object or scene from disparate visual elements.
	- Disparate can mean distinct or disconnected from one another. So disparate visual elements are visual parts that don't obviously belong together until the brain organizes them.

	- #question What are Gestalt principles?
	- #question What are some organizational principles of the brain?
	- It's an active process because the brain doesn't just passively receive sensory information. It actively works to structure and organize raw, disparate sensory inputs (like individual colors, edges, shapes, or light patterns) into a meaningful and coherent whole, such as recognizing a complete object or scene. This involves interpretation, grouping, and synthesis, rather than just a simple reception of data.

	- This process happens automatically and outside our conscious awareness. The brain organizes sensory information to allow us to perceive a unified object like a face, tree, or building without having to consciously piece together its individual elements. 
	- The brain is taking separate, individual pieces of visual information (colors, edges, shapes, or light patterns) and organizing them into a unified perception (seeing a face, tree or building)

- The cues taken into account when perceptually organizing is
	- depth, form, motion, and constancy
		- #comment Constancy refers to the brain’s ability to perceive objects as stable and unchanging even when the sensory information about them changes — such as differences in lighting, distance, or angle.
			- Helps us maintain a consistent view of the world despite variations in sensory input.
		- #question What specifically is meant by form and constancy?
	- #question Are these all the cues?
