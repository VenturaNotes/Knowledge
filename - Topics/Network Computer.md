- A network computer without a hard drive relies on a network to provide processing power, programs, and data. Network computers are typically used in an environment where all resources are centrally managed by an IT department or service provider. Often referred to as "thin" clients, network computers can help organizations reduce costs associated with desktop and laptop management.
