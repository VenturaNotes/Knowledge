- the mechanism that controls the passage of molecules from the blood into the cerebrospinal fluid and the tissue spaces surrounding the cells of the brain. The endothelial cells lining the walls of the brain capillaries are more tightly joined together at their edges than those lining capillaries supplying other parts of the body. This allows the passage of solutions and fat-soluble compounds but excludes particles and large molecules. The importance of the blood-brain barrier is that it protects the brain from the effect of many substances harmful to it. A disadvantage, however, is that many useful drugs pass only in small amounts into the brain, and much larger doses may have to be given than normal. Brain cancer, for example, is relatively insensitive to chemotherapy, although drugs such as diazepam, alcohol, and fat-soluble general anaesthetics pass readily and quickly to the brain cells.

- The mechanism that controls the passage of substances from the blood to the cerebrospinal fluid bathing the brain and spinal cord. It resides in the special properties of the blood capillaries that supply the central nervous system, the walls of which act like a semipermeable membrane, permitting the passage of solutions but excluding particles and large molecules, including potentially noxious substances. This barrier provides the central nervous system (CNS) with a constant environment, while not interfering with the transport of essential metabolites. But it is also a constraint on the effective delivery of drugs to the CNS. However, any breakdown in the blood-brain barrier, e.g. due to a stroke or trauma, is a major factor in the pathology of such diseases. See also GLIA.
