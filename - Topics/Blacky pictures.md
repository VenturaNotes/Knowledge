- $n$. A projective test resembling the TAT but designed for children, comprising a series of twelve cartoon drawings in which a dog called Blacky, designated as male or female to match the sex of the respondent, is depicted playing human roles with other dogs called Mama and Papa and a sibling of indeterminate age and sex called Tippy. The respondent is asked to make up a vivid, imaginative story about each picture and then to respond to a series of multiple-choice and short-answer questions about the picture. The test was constructed by the US psychologist Gerald S. Blum (born 1922) in the course of postgraduate research and first published by him in the journal Genetic Psychology Monographs in 1949. Also called the Blacky Test. Compare Children's APPERCEPTION TEST.
