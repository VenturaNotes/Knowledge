- The predictive index (PI) refers to two assessments, the PI cognitive assessment and the PI behavioral assessment, that businesses often use to aid their recruitment, team building, performance coaching, and leadership development efforts. It helps organizations to understand the strengths and weaknesses of employees and job candidates, thereby aiding the business in determining the scope of training required for existing employees and improving the hiring process.
- While there is no pass or fail score for these PI assessments, candidates who score above 20 are more likely to make a positive impression on recruiters. These assessments aim to measure an existing employee or job candidate's ability to understand complex concepts and describe their personality traits, such as extraversion, patience, formality, and dominance.
