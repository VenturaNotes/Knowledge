- A document that gives details about a new issue of shares and invites the public to buy shares or debentures in the company. A copy must be filed with the Registrar of Companies. The prospectus of a listed company must comply with Stock Exchange regulations; that of an unlisted company must conform to the provisions of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. In either case, it will describe the aims, capital structure, and any past history of the venture, and may contain future profit forecasts. There are heavy penalties for knowingly making false statements in a prospectus. See OFFER BY PROSPECTUS.
