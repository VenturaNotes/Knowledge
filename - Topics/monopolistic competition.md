- A market for a particular product or service in which there are many competing sellers offering similar but non-identical goods. Such a market resembles perfect competition in that there are a multiplicity of buyers and sellers and few barriers to entry. However, because each specific good can only be obtained from one seller, the producer acquires a power to influence market prices that would not exist under perfect competition: it has, in effect, a monopoly in its own product. In such a market product differentiation becomes essential, and branding, advertising, and marketing will be crucial to a firm's success.

- A market where each firm faces a downward sloping demand curve and acts as a monopoly in setting price. However, there are many firms selling differentiated versions of the same product and many potential entrants. If monopoly profit is earned new firms will enter the market. This causes the demand curve of each firm to shift downward and profit to fall. Entry will cease when all monopoly profit is eliminated. In equilibrium all firms will price above marginal cost but earn only normal profit. Models of monopolistic competition are frequently used when the number of firms in an industry is the issue of interest.
