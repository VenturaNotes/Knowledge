- screening tests to detect the presence of precancerous changes in the cervix (neck) of the uterus (see CERVICAL INTRAEPITHELIAL NEOPLASIA). Cervical smears are the standard first-line screening tools in most countries: screening programmes based on the traditional Papanicolaou (Pap) test have been mostly superseded by liquid-based cytology. Colposcopy is indicated when abnormal cells (dyskaryosis) are detected.
