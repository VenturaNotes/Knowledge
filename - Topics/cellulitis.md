- $n$. an infection of the deep layers of the skin and subcutaneous tissue by staphylococci, streptococci, or other bacteria. The patient is systemically unwell and feverish. It is most common on the lower legs and there may be associated lymphangitis and lymphadenitis. It is otherwise similar to erysipelas, but the margins are less clearly defined because the infection is deeper. Intravenous antibiotics are often required.
