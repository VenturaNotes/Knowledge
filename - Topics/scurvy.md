## Source [^1]
- $n$. a disease that is caused by a deficiency of vitamin C (ascorbic acid). It results from a lack of fresh fruit and vegetables in the diet (unlike most animals, humans cannot synthesize ascorbic acid and must obtain it from food). The first sign of scurvy is swollen bleeding gums, and a rash of tiny bleeding spots around the hair follicles is characteristic. This may be followed by subcutaneous bleeding and the opening of previously healed wounds. Treatment is by administering vitamin C.
