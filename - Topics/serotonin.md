- (5-hydroxytryptamine) $n$. a compound widely distributed in the tissues, particularly in the blood platelets, intestinal wall, and central nervous system. Serotonin is thought to play a role in inflammation similar to that of histamine and it is involved in the genesis of a migrainous headache. Drugs that act like serotonin are used in the treatment of migraine (see $5 \mathrm{HT}_{1}$ AGONIST). It also acts as a neurotransmitter, and its levels in the brain are believed to have an important influence on mood. Drugs that prolong its effects are used as antidepressants (see SNRI; SSRI).
