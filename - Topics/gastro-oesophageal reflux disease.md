- (GORD) a condition characterized by excessive gastro-oesophageal reflux, which occurs due to the impairment of neuromuscular mechanisms (such as the lower oesophageal sphincter) designed to minimize reflux. Symptoms range from heartburn and acid reflux to difficulty or pain when swallowing, nocturnal cough, and chronic throat symptoms. Complications include erosive oesophagitis, oesophageal strictures, and the development of Barrett's oesophagus, a premalignant condition.
