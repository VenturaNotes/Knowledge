- A technique used in optical recording. The surface of the medium is impressed with a very fine pattern that scatters light. When a spot on the surface is heated by a laser beam, the material flows to leave a smooth reflective surface. The technique is sometimes called [[moth-eye]] recording because the pattern resembles that of the cornea of a moth's eye.
