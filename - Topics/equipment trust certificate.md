- (ETC) In the USA, a document setting out the details of a loan used to fund the purchase of a major item of equipment. The holder of the certificate has a secured interest in the asset in the event of a corporate default. The arrangement is therefore similar to a mortgage, and like house mortgages ETCs are often securitized.
