- (IUI) a procedure for assisting conception in which carefully washed spermatozoa are injected into the uterus through the vagina at the time of ovulation, which is induced and monitored (using ultrasound) to determine the day of insemination. This procedure is used in cases of male infertility due to inability of the sperm to penetrate the cervical mucus or the barriers surrounding the ovum, in which case the sperm may be treated in vitro to improve their motility and acrosome reaction. IUI is also used for donor insemination.
