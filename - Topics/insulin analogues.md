## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- a group of synthetic human insulins with specific alterations in their amino-acid sequences designed to modify their rate of absorption from the subcutaneous injection site. Some are absorbed more rapidly and have a shorter duration of action than conventional short-acting human insulin; others are absorbed more slowly at a more consistent rate than conventional medium-acting isophane insulin to give a more sustained control of fasting and premeal blood glucose levels and therefore a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia. These analogues include the short-acting insulin aspart, insulin glulisine, and insulin lispro; the long-acting insulin detemir and insulin glargine; and the ultra-long-acting insulin degludec.
