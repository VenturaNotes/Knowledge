- (second generation) 2G refers to the second generation of cellular connectivity. It replaced 1G technology, which operated on an analog signal, and was the first major upgrade to cellular technology. With this new generation of technology, the network began to operate using a digital signal with upgraded standards, including GSM, D-AMPS, and IS-95 A. Maximum data transmission speeds for 2G (developed in the early 1990s) was a mere 1 Mbps.
