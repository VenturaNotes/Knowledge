- An insurance policy covering employers for any financial losses they may sustain as a result of the dishonesty of employees. Policies can be arranged to cover all employees or specific named persons. Because of the nature of the cover, insurers require full details of the procedure adopted by the organization in recruiting and vetting new employees and they usually reserve the right to refuse to cover a particular person without giving a reason.
