- (media research; media planning; media selection) An investigation into the relative effectiveness and the relative costs of using the various advertising media in an advertising campaign. Before committing an advertising budget it is necessary to carry out marketing research on potential customers, their reading habits, television-watching habits, how many times the advertisers wish the potential customers to see an advertisement, how great a percentage of the market they wish to reach, etc. These elements all need to be considered and balanced to plan a campaign that will effectively reach its target audience at a reasonable cost.
