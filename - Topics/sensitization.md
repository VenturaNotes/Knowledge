- n. 
- (1) alteration of the responsiveness of the body to the presence of foreign substances. In the development of an allergy, an individual becomes sensitized to a particular allergen and reaches a state of hypersensitivity. The phenomena of sensitization are due to the production of antibodies. 
- (2) (in behavior therapy) a form of aversion therapy in which anxiety-producing stimuli are associated with the unwanted behavior. In covert sensitization the behavior and an unpleasant feeling (such as disgust) are evoked simultaneously by verbal cues.

- (1) (of a cell) The alteration of the integrity of a plasma membrane resulting from the reaction of specific antibodies with antigens on the surface of the cell. In the presence of complement, the cell ruptures. 
- (2) (of an individual) Initial exposure to a specific antigen such that re-exposure to the same antigen causes a severe immune response, as in allergies or anaphylaxis. 
- (3) (in animal behavior) The process whereby an animal gives a stronger than normal response to a stimulus after previous application of a different stimulus. For example, if the tail of a sea slug (Aplysia) is given an electric shock, a subsequent tap on the animal's siphon will cause a marked withdrawal of the siphon that is greater than that without a preceding tail shock. Compare DISHABITUATION.
