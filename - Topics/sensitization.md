- (1) alteration of the responsiveness of the body to the presence of foreign substances. In the development of an allergy, an individual becomes sensitized to a particular allergen and reaches a state of hypersensitivity. The phenomena of sensitization are due to the production of antibodies. 
- (2) (in behavior therapy) a form of aversion therapy in which anxiety-producing stimuli are associated with the unwanted behavior. In covert sensitization the behavior and an unpleasant feeling (such as disgust) are evoked simultaneously by verbal cues.
