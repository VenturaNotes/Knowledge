## Source [^1]
- an enzyme, found mainly in retroviruses, that catalyses the synthesis of DNA from RNA. It enables the viral RNA to be integrated into the host DNA. Reverse transcriptase inhibitors are antiviral drugs that inhibit this process; they include zidovudine and didanosine, used in the treatment of HIV infection; and lamivudine and tenofovir disoproxil, for treating HIV infection and chronic hepatitis B.
