- An add-in card that allows a computer to be connected to a phone line and to transmit or receive fax messages. The card and its associated software allow anything that can be displayed on the screen to be converted into a fax image and transmitted, just like a fax machine. Incoming faxes are treated initially as graphic images, and if they contain text that is to be edited or incorporated into a word processor document for instance, then they must be subjected to an optical character recognition (OCR) process.
