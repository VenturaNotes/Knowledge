- Digital watermarking refers to embedding a piece of data—known as a watermark—onto a file. This file can be an audio file, an image, or a movie. The addition of a digital watermark shows ownership of the file, and the mark is difficult or impossible to remove. In theory, this makes it impossible for another individual to use that file for free. Proper purchasing is thus required before a file can be used.
