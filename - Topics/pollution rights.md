- A government-issued permit that entitles a firm to emit a specified quantity of pollution. The issue of pollution rights allows the regulatory authority to control the amount of pollution by limiting the number of permits. Trade in pollution rights provides an incentive to reduce emissions and benefit from the sale of permits (or reduce costs by not having to buy permits).
