## Source [^1]
- A strong force of attraction holding atoms together in a molecule or crystal. In general, atoms combine to form molecules by sharing or transferring electrons in their outer shells. Typically chemical bonds have energies of about $1000 \mathrm{~kJ} \mathrm{~mol}^{-1}$ and are distinguished from the much weaker forces between molecules. See also COVALENT BOND; ELECTROVALENT BOND; HYDROGEN BOND.
