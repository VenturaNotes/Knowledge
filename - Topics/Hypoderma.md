- $n$. a genus of non-bloodsucking beelike insects $\textendash$ the warble flies $\textendash$ widely distributed in Europe, North America, and Asia. Cattle are the usual hosts for the parasitic maggots, but rare and accidental infections of humans have occurred (see MYIASIS), especially in farm workers. The maggots migrate beneath the skin surface, producing an inflamed linear lesion similar to that of creeping eruption.
