- A method of selecting a contiguous area of memory that is to be allocated for a segment. The free-space list is scanned in order of starting address, and the allocation made from the first free area whose size exceeds that of the request. Despite its apparent simplicity this algorithm has a number of desirable properties in terms of performance.
