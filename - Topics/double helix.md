- $n$. The molecular structure of DNA: two spirals or helixes coiled round a single axis with complementary base pairing between the strands. It is also displayed by double-stranded RNA. It was discovered in 1953 by the US biologist James D(ewey) Watson (born 1928) and the English molecular biologist Francis H(arry) C(ompton) Crick (1916-2004), working with X-ray diffraction images produced by the biophysicist Rosalind E. Franklin (1920-58), although the Nobel prize awarded for this work in 1962 went to Watson, Crick, and Franklin's research supervisor at King's College London, the New Zealand-born biophysicist Maurice H(ugh) F(rederick) Wilkins (1916-2004). \[From Greek helix a spiral]
