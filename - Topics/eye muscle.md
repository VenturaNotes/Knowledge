The intrinsic muscles, which are involuntary, are situated inside the eyeball and comprise the ciliary muscle (see CILIARY BODY) and the iris. The extrinsic muscles, which comprise three pairs of voluntary muscles, are inserted on the sclera (outer surface) of the eyeball and control its movements.
