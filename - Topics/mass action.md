- $n$. The doctrine propounded by the US physiological psychologist Karl Spencer Lashley (1890-1958) that the cerebral cortex functions as a coordinated unit, with large areas being involved in all complex functions, and that consequently, within limits, the degree of deficit resulting from a localized lesion depends on the amount of cortex rather than the specific region affected. This doctrine is now known to have many exceptions, localization of function being common in the cerebral cortex. See also equipotentiality.
