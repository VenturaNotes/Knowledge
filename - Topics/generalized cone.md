- $n$. In the computational theory of vision pioneered in the late 1970s by the English psychologist David Courtenay Marr (1945-80), a basic element that is used in the perceptual representation (2) of a three-dimensional object and that consists of a surface formed by moving a cross-section of constant shape but continuously variable size along an axis. For example, with a circular cross-section and a vertical axis of movement, a generalized cone can generate a three-dimensional outline of a wine glass, the diameter of the circle changing as it moves down the glass, and multiple generalized cones with differently shaped cross-sections and axes of movement can be used to generate images of more complex objects such as people. Compare GeON.
