- GRUB is an acronym for grand unified bootloader. A bootloader is a program that loads a computerʻs operating system into the computerʻs memory, allowing users to load programs on their operating system of choice. GRUB is a popular type of bootloader, typically used on Unix-like systems, due to its flexible configuration capabilities that allow users to select the operating system or environment they would like to use on their computer system.
