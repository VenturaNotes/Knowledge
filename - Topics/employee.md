- A person working for somebody else, for wages or salary, rather than working on their own account and selling their product or services. An employee has a contract of employment, and employers are liable for damage caused either by or to employees in the course of their duties. In the UK employers are required to collect income tax and National Insurance contributions from employees liable to them. Similar legislation exists in many countries. Self-employed workers are responsible for their own insurance and for their tax and National Insurance payments.

- A person who works under the direction and control of another (the employer) in return for a wage or salary. An employee works for the employer under a contract of employment, whereas an independent contractor who is contracted to perform a specific task works under a contract for services. The distinction is crucial since employees enjoy more protection under employment legislation. The question as to whether someone is or is not an employee is governed by a number of tests laid down by the courts over many years and can be far from clear. Compare WORKER.
