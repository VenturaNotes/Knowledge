- A type of selection that favors organisms with a high biotic potential ($\boldsymbol{r}$ value). Organisms that are $r$ selected ($\boldsymbol{r}$ strategists) are able to colonize a habitat rapidly, utilizing the food and other resources before other organisms are established and begin to compete. The $r$ strategists tend to be relatively small organisms with short life spans (e.g. bacteria) and often live in temporary or unstable environments; characteristically their survival depends on their ability to produce large numbers of offspring rather than on their ability to compete. Compare K selection. See also population dynamics; survival curve.
