- (in genetics) A repair mechanism that helps to ensure faithful DNA replication in living cells. It is a function of the enzyme DNA polymerase, which catalyses the replication process. This enzyme identifies and excises mismatched bases at the end of the growing strand, leaving the end free to accept the correct nucleotide instead, thereby restoring the correct complementary base sequence. See also DNA REPAIR.
