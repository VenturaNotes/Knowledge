- The reactant that is completely consumed first, determining the amount of product formed
## Source[^1]
- A reactant in a chemical reaction that determines the amount of product that is produced is the limiting reactant or limiting reagent
- The reason for a limiting reactant is that elements and compounds react in a balanced chemical equation according to the [[mole ratio]] between them
