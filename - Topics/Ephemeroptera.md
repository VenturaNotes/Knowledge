- An order of exopterygote insects that comprises the mayflies, in which the adult stage lasts for only a few hours. The adults have two pairs of wings held vertically at rest, a pair of tail bristles (cerci), and vestigial mouthparts (they do not feed). The nymphs (naiads) live for up to a number of years; they are mainly herbivorous but some possess mandibles for feeding on animal prey.
