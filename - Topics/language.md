- n. 
- (1) A conventional system of communicative sounds and sometimes (though not necessarily) written symbols capable of fulfilling the following hierarchy of functions suggested by the German-born Austrian psychologist Karl BÃ¼hler (1879-1963) and the Austrian-born British philosopher Karl R(aimund) Popper (1902-94): expressing a communicator's physical, emotional, or cognitive state; issuing signals that can elicit responses from other individuals; describing a concept, idea, or external state of affairs; and commenting on a previous communication. The concept of language is often interpreted loosely to embrace codes devised for specific purposes, as in expressions such as programming languages, and forms of communication that fulfil some but not all of the four listed functions, including body language and the language of the bees (see waggle dance), neither of which can fulfil the fourth and highest function. 
- (2) The particular system of verbal communication, such as the English language, that is used by a specific nation or people. \[From Old French langage, from Latin lingua the tongue]
