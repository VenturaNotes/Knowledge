- a rare autosomal dominant condition characterized by hypertension associated with hypokalaemia, metabolic alkalosis, and low levels of plasma renin and aldosterone. The hypertension often starts in infancy and is due to excess resorption of sodium and excretion of potassium by the renal tubules. The syndrome is caused by a single genetic mutation on chromosome 16, which results in dysregulation of a sodium channel in the distal convoluted tubule. Treatment is with a low salt diet and a potassium-sparing diuretic that directly blocks the sodium channel, such as amiloride or triamterene. \[G. G. Liddle (1921-89), US endocrinologist]
