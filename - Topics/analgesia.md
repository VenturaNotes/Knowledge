- $n$. reduced sensibility to pain, without loss of consciousness and without the sense of touch necessarily being affected. The condition may arise accidentally, if nerves are diseased or damaged, or be induced deliberately by the use of pain-killing drugs (see analgesic). Strictly speaking, local anaesthesia should be called local analgesia. See also RELATIVE ANALGESIA.
