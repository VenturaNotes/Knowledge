- $n$. reduced sensibility to pain, without loss of consciousness and without the sense of touch necessarily being affected. The condition may arise accidentally, if nerves are diseased or damaged, or be induced deliberately by the use of pain-killing drugs (see analgesic). Strictly speaking, local anaesthesia should be called local analgesia. See also RELATIVE ANALGESIA.
## Source[^2]
- $n$. Absence or diminution of pain sensation, often induced by analgesic drugs or hypnosis. See also audioanalgesia, hidden observer, neODISSOCIATION THEORY, THERMOANALGESIA. Compare ANAESTHESIA. \[From Greek an- without + algesis sense of pain, from algos pain + -ia indicating a condition or quality]
