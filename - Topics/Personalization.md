- Personalization is the process of customizing an experience or communication for a customer based on information such as name, location, interests, etc. Personalized communication can improve engagement and drive more sales. Marketers often send personalized emails that include the customer's name in the subject line to grab their attention, and recommend products based on the customer's interests or past purchases.
