## Source [^1]
- An umbrella term that covers all uses of computers in engineering applications. Thus computer-aided design, computer-aided planning, and computer-aided manufacturing, are all branches of computer-aided engineering. The subject area is not usually taken to include software engineering.
## Source[^2]
- Computer-aided engineering (CAE) refers to multiple computer applications needed to carry out engineering tasks, such as design, testing, and simulation. CAE software typically falls into one of four categories: Computer-aided design (CAD), computational fluid dynamics (CFD), finite element analysis/method (FEA/FEM), and multibody simulation (MBS).
