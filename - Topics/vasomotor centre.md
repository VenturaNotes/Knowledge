## Synthesis

## Source [^1]
- a collection of nerve cells in the medulla oblongata that receives information from sensory receptors in the circulatory system (see BARORECEPTOR) and brings about reflex changes in the rate of the heartbeat and in the diameter of blood vessels, so that the blood pressure can be adjusted. The vasomotor center also receives impulses from elsewhere in the brain, so that emotion (such as fear) may also influence the heart rate and blood pressure. The center works through vasomotor nerves of the sympathetic and parasympathetic systems.
## Source[^2]
- The region of the medulla oblongata of the brain that mediates the diameter of the blood vessels (via the action of the vasomotor nerves) and hence controls blood pressure (see VASOCONSTRICTION; VASODILATION).
