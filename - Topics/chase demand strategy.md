- (variable output plan) An approach to aggregate planning that attempts to match supply and output with fluctuating demand. Depending on the product or service involved, the approach can incur costs by the ineffective use of capacity at periods of low demand, by the need to recruit or lay off staff, by learning-curve effects, and by a possible loss of quality. The advantages include low storage costs and greater ability to respond to the needs of the customer. Compare LEVEL OUTPUT STRATEGY.
