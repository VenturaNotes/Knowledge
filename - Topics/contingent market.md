- A market for the trade of a contingent commodity. Many contingent markets do not exist: in some cases this is because too few people would be interested in trading on them to make a market economic to run. In other cases a contingent market cannot be organized because the contingencies themselves, such as the invention of currently unimagined new products, cannot be specified in advance.
