- A system of costing applied to industries in which the method of production is continuous processing; examples include electricity generation, and bottling. Because the product is homogeneous, this costing system is essentially a form of average costing in which the unit cost is obtained by dividing the total production cost by the number of units produced. Compare PROCESS COSTING.
