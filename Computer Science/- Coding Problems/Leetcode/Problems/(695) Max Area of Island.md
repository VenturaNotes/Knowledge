- Can use [[Depth first search|DFS]]
	- DFS is a recursive algorithm
	- Will use a HashSet to mark positions we've already visited so we don't revisit them
- Overall time complexity is $O(m*n)$ 
	- This will also be memory complexity since we have a HashSet that could contain every cell in the grid
	- DFS is also recursive so there is a call stack associated with it
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visit = set()
	    # A small optimization is that you don't actually need
		# an external visit set. You can actually just use the grid
		# itself to determine if you visited a position or not but
		# we're not guaranteed that we can write over the input grid
		# so I don't think it's a big deal to use the hash set
		# You could just clarify with interviewer if you really want
		# to. It's just a small optimization which isn't that big
		# of an opinion.

        def dfs(r, c):
            if (r < 0 or r == ROWS or c < 0 or c == COLS or 
                grid[r][c] == 0 or (r, c) in visit):
                return 0
            
            visit.add((r, c))
            return (1 + dfs(r+1, c) +
                        dfs(r-1, c) +
                        dfs(r, c+1) +
                        dfs(r, c-1))
        area = 0
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                area = max(area, dfs(r, c))
        return area

### (1) Depth First Search
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        visit = set()

        def dfs(r, c):
            if (r < 0 or r == ROWS or c < 0 or
                c == COLS or grid[r][c] == 0 or
                (r, c) in visit
            ):
                return 0
            visit.add((r, c))
            return (1 + dfs(r + 1, c) + 
                        dfs(r - 1, c) + 
                        dfs(r, c + 1) + 
                        dfs(r, c - 1))

        area = 0
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                area = max(area, dfs(r, c))
        return area

### (2) Breadth First Search
```python
class Solution:
    def maxAreaOfIsland(self, grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        area = 0

        def bfs(r, c):
            q = deque()
            grid[r][c] = 0
            q.append((r, c))
            res = 1

            while q:
                row, col = q.popleft()  
                for dr, dc in directions:
                    nr, nc = dr + row, dc + col
                    if (nr < 0 or nc < 0 or nr >= ROWS or
                        nc >= COLS or grid[nr][nc] == 0
                    ):
                        continue
                    q.append((nr, nc))
                    grid[nr][nc] = 0
                    res += 1
            return res

        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if grid[r][c] == 1:
                    area = max(area, bfs(r, c))

### (3) Disjoint Set Union
```python
class DSU:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.Parent = list(range(n + 1))
        self.Size = [1] * (n + 1)

            self.Size[pu] += self.Size[pv]
            self.Parent[pv] = pu
        else:
            self.Size[pv] += self.Size[pu]
            self.Parent[pu] = pv
        return True
    
    def getSize(self, node):
        par = self.find(node)
        return self.Size[par]

        dsu = DSU(ROWS * COLS)

        def index(r, c):
