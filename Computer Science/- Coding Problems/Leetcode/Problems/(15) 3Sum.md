- The array can have duplicates
	- Cannot have duplicates in solution though
- Want to find 3 numbers in array that sum to 0.
- Need to find all unique triplets in array which gives sum of zero
- Solution to problem is to sort input array.
	- Helps eliminate duplicates (although important to understand permutations and combinations)
- Could solve this similarly to Two Sum II for remaining two elements.
- Time complexity
	- O(nlogn) + $O(n^2)$ which reduces to $O(n^2)$
		- Sorting array
		- Two nested loops
			- Use one loop to tell us first value
			- Second loop to solve Two Sum II
- Space complexity: O(1) or O(n)
	- This is because sorting can take some extra memory in some libraries depending on implementation of sorting
- Not going to use brute force of triple loops $O(n^3)$ 
```python
class Solution:
	def threeSum(self, nums: List[int]) -> List[List[int]]:
		res = []
		nums.sort()

		for i, a in enumerate(nums):
			# If previous element duplicate, move onto next element
			if i > 0 and a == nums[i - 1]:
				continue
			
			# No out of bounds exception as not finding the 
			# value of index and if last element, will exit loop
			# as l will not be less than r. 
			l, r = i + 1, len(nums) - 1
			while l < r:
				threeSum = a + nums[l] + nums[r]
				if threeSum > 0:
					r -= 1
				elif threeSum < 0:
					l += 1
				else:
					res.append([a, nums[l], nums[r]])
					# Make left pointer move right one to find 
					# another solution
					l += 1
					while nums[l] == nums[l - 1] and l < r:
						l += 1
		return res
```

### Dry Run
- Using `[-1, 0, 1, 2, -1, -4]`
- Array is sorted first giving: `[-4, -1, -1, 0, 1, 2]`
- Will use the [[enumerate() (Python)|enumerate()]] function in python to traverse the index of `nums` (which starts at 0) and the value of that index
- First iteration of loop
	- First values
		- i = 0
		- a = -4
	- i is not greater than 0
