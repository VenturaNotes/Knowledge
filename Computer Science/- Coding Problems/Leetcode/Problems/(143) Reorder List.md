- Given a head of singly linked list and want to re-arrange it into a different order
	- So given original list, put first value in first position. Last value in second position and so on back and forth.
- Time complexity for solution of O(n)
- And memory complexity will be O(1)
	- If using extra space, would put linked list in array, and then use pointers to create new linked list
	- Can do this without using extra memory though
- Will take second portion of list and reverse it
- Then will take both portions of list and merge them together
- Could use a slow and fast pointer (to split the lists)
	- #question what is this?
	- Will shift slow pointer by 1 and fast pointer by 2
		- Keep going until fast pointer reaches end of list or reaches last value of list
		- If even list, slow pointer will be at halfway point
			- Then we know `slow.next` will be beginning of second half of list
		- Different for odd list
- Want last pointer to be pointing at null
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        # find middle
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        # reverse second half
        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None
        while second:
            tmp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = tmp
        
        # merge two halfs
        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1
            first, second = tmp1, tmp2
```
- Not using any extra memory
- Doing this in linear time (although we are iterating through the list twice.)

### (1) Brute Force
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        if not head:
            return
        
        nodes = []
        cur = head
        while cur:
            nodes.append(cur)
            cur = cur.next
        
        i, j = 0, len(nodes) - 1
        while i < j:
            nodes[i].next = nodes[j]
            i += 1
            if i >= j:
                break
            nodes[j].next = nodes[i]
            j -= 1
        
        nodes[i].next = None
```
Time Complexity: $O(n)$
Space Complexity: $O(n)$

### (2) Recursion
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:

        def rec(root: ListNode, cur: ListNode) -> ListNode:
            if not cur:
                return root
            root = rec(root, cur.next)

            if not root:
                return None
            tmp = None
            if root == cur or root.next == cur:
                cur.next = None
            else:
                tmp = root.next
                root.next = cur
                cur.next = tmp
            return tmp
            
        head = rec(head, head.next)
```
Time Complexity: $O(n)$
Space Complexity: $O(n)$
### (3) Reverse and Merge
```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next

class Solution:
    def reorderList(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> None:
        slow, fast = head, head.next
        while fast and fast.next:
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next

        second = slow.next
        prev = slow.next = None
        while second:
            tmp = second.next
            second.next = prev
            prev = second
            second = tmp

        first, second = head, prev
        while second:
            tmp1, tmp2 = first.next, second.next
            first.next = second
            second.next = tmp1
            first, second = tmp1, tmp2
```
Time Complexity: $O(n)$
Space Complexity: $O(1)$
