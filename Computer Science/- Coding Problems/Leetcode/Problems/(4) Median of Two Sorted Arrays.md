## Source [^1]
- Hard problem
- Two arrays in sorted order of size `m` and `n`. Need to return the median of the two sorted arrays. We want to put them together and find the median of both of them
- Overall time complexity should be O(log(m+n))
	- If you want a log algorithm, you need [[binary search]]
	- Goal to find median is to partition the array into left and right half evenly to find median
