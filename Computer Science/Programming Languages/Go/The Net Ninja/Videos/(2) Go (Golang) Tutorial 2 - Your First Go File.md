Code
```Go
package main

import "fmt" //Formatting strings and printing messages to the console

func main(){ //Can only have 1 function
fmt.Println("Hello, ninjos!")
// To export something, you have to use a capital for whatever you're exporting
// Therefore Println is capitalized
}
```

Output
`Hello, ninjos!`
