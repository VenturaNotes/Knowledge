```java
public class Main {

	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		//final cannot be changed or updated later in your program
		//Common practice to uppercase the variable name
		//Use final to define a constant
		final double PI = 3.14159;

		//Java defines the "const" keyword but it doesn't actually use it
		//To declare a constant, you need to use the "final" keyword
		
				
		//PI = 4;  //You can't change a final variable
		
		System.out.println(PI);
	
	}
}
```

- Output
```
3.14159
```
