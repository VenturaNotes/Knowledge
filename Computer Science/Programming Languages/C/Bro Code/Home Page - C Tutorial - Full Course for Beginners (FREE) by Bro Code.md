- Middle-level language (originated in 1970s)
- Most widely used programming language to date
- Predecessor is B. Created in 1972 by John Carmack

- Low level languages
	- Advantages
		- Efficient
		- Machine architect
		- less memory
		- Fast
	- Disadvantages
		- Difficult to understand
		- Time consuming to write

- High level langugase
	- Advantages
		- Easy peezy lemon sequeezy
		- Understandable
		- Abstraction
	- Disadvantages
		- Slow
		- More memory
		- Difficult to work with low level hardware

Middle level languages can act as a bridge between high level software and applications as well as low level hardware and embedded systems

Most compilers, kernals, and operating systems are written in C

"Nearly every language uses or is influenced by C"

C is what provided many of the original programming concepts such as variables, data types, loops, arrays, functions

Python is written with C and the default implementation is CPython

C is everywhere from databases to self-driving cars, operating systems to embedded systems.

Important notes
- Not object oriented (procedural, not abstract)
- C++ is an extension of C
- C is difficult

Need an IDE (text editor)
	An integrated development environment
	Editor to write C code
	VSCode is good

Need a GCC compiler (GNU compiler collection)
	It is an optimizing compiler produced by the GNU Project
	Converts C code to machine code (10010s)

In order to run gcc, go to "Terminal" -> "Configure Default Build Task..." -> C/C++: gcc build active file.

Going to File -> "autosave" makes things much better
