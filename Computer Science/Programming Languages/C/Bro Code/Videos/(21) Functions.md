```C
//A function is a small section of code that is executed whenever we call it. Also known as
//invoking a function. It's useful so you don't need to rewrite code too many times

#include <stdio.h>

void birthday()
{
   printf("\nHappy birthday to you!");
   printf("\nHappy birthday to you!");
   printf("\nHappy birthday dear...YOU!");
   printf("\nHappy birthday to you!\n");
}

int main()
{
   birthday();
   birthday();
   birthday();

   return 0;
}
