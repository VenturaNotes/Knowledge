- Transpilers
	- New features in ES2015
		- all features not fully implemented in all browsers
	- Chrome and Firefox
		- implements 90% of features but few features are missing (should be different story in 2017. This video was published Jul 13, 2016)
	- Transpiler
		- Useful for when browsers don't fully implement new features yet
- Transpiler
	- Takes ES2015 source code we write and generates ES5 code that runs in every browser.
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-11-26 at 6.30.54 AM.png|500]]
	- Traceur, Babel, and Typescript are examples of a transpiler
		- Will be using typescript for tutorial
	- We will be writing ES2015 code and Typescript is going to traspile that code to ES5 which will run on every browser. Can still run code that works on the browser
