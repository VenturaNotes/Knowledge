Scratch JS (<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">this chrome extension no longer exists</mark>)
- Write and execute ES6/ES2015 within DevTools!
	- This extension is an add-on for DevTools which integrates both the Traceur and Babel transpilers, allowing you to test out the new JS features coming with ECMAScript 6, also known as ES6 or ES2015. It also supports CoffeeScript, LiveScript and more compile-to-JS languages will be added soon.
	- It is restricted to ES2015 features only. You can't do this with typescript
