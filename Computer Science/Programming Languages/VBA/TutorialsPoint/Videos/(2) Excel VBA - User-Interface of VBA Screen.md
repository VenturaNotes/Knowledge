	- Learning the interface of VBA
	- To find "Developer" tab on Mac
		- Excel $\to$ preferences $\to$ View $\to$ In Ribbon, Show “Developer tab” checkbox
	- ![[Screenshot 2025-01-25 at 1.59.38 AM.png]]
		- This is what Visual Basic looks like (It doesn't full screen on mac)
	- Description
		- At the top you have a [[menu bar]] with "File, Edit, View, etc."
		- Below that are commands which are known as toolbars. There are two [[toolbar|toolbars]] in this example
		- The "Project - VBAProject" is just a [[project explorer]]
			- It has all the elements / objects
			- When we say all the objects
				- It can contain sheets, workbooks, modules, class, and different user forms
			- Collection of all these objects
	- Creating a second sheet
		- Able to create a second sheet by pressing the "+" symbol and it will show up in the project explorer
		- One excel file is nothing but one project (Excel_VBA.xlsx)
			- That is nothing but one VBA project
			- The `Excel_VBA` is the name of the given file
				- One file so one project
	- New Window
		- Doing "Command + N" is a shortcut for a new file
			- Then it shows we have 2 VBAProject
		- We have folder, sheet, and then workbook as the hierarchy
		- File needs to be open for the object to be displayed in VBA
	- User Forms
		- Can add modules or user forms
		- Click "Insert" and then click on "[[UserForm]]"
			- UserForm is used to display a form which will have all the checkboxes, radio button, and so on on which you can work on
	- Modules
		- To create modules, click "insert" $\to$ "module"
		- Whatever coding we will be writing, we will be writing in this module part
			- When clicking on the [[module (VBA)|module]], it's nothing more than an [[editor pane]]
				- This is the module editor
- ![[Screenshot 2025-01-25 at 2.24.46 AM.png]]
	- If we're on a module, we have
		- "Module1 (Code)"
		- "UserForm1 (UserForm)"
		- "Sheet2 (Code)"
	- [[Properties Window (VBA)|Properties Window]]
		- Go to "View" $\to$ "Properties Window"
			- Might be open by default though
		- Will give all properties and values related to the object you have selected
		- Selecting Sheet1 Object or the UserForm Object 
			- You can see the properties
		- You can change the name of the properties from this place
		- Double clicking at a location if it's floating around will set it in place of the window
	- [[Immediate Window (VBA)|Immediate Window]]
		- Go to "View" $\to$ "Immediate"
		- The shortcut on Windows + "Ctrl + G"
		- By clicking on it, we will get a small window
			- If you ask it a question, it will give you the answer
			- So whatever question you type in the place automatically gives you the answer
	- [[Object Browser (VBA)|Object Browser]]
		- Go to "View" $\to$ "Object Browser"
		- If you want to learn the project properties and their methods, it's known as object browser
		- It will show all objects present and what methods you'll be able to work with
		- Will show all classes of the objects
			- And within a class will show the methods or "members"
			- So for PivotFormulas, some methods are "Add", "Count", "Item" and others
	- Can just close these individual windows by pressing the "X" button
