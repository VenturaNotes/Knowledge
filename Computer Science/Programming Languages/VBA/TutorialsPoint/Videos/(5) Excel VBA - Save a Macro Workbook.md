	- In the previous video, the macro did the formatting part
	- Macro can't be saved in .xlsx version
	- When clicking "save" on excel sheet, we get a message
		- It says that we can't save a file in macro-free workbook
		- Select "No" to save file with features and then choose a macro-enabled file type in the File Type list
		- We don't want to save the file type as "Excel Workbook"
			- We want "Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook" as file type
			- The extension is [[Excel Macro-Enabled Workbook|XLSM]]
	- The exclamation point in the image of the file indicates that it's a macro-enabled workbook
	- This was how to save a workbook with macros within it
