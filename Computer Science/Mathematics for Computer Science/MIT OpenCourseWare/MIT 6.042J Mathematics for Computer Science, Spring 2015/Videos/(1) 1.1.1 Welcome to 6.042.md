- Mathematics for Computer Science
	- Joint subject between electrical engineering and computer science and mathematics

## Quick Summary
- (1) Fundamental Concepts of Discrete Mathematics (sets, relations, proof methods,...)
	- Define abstractly what a function is
- (2) Discrete Mathematical Structures (numbers, graphs, trees, counting...)
	- Numbers packaged with operations on them like plus, times and exponentiation
	- Graphs and trees
	- Methods for counting
		- How big is search space?
		- Such as search space for passwords. You want this to be large or a cracker could search through them all
- (3) Discrete Probability Theory
	- Get by sums instead of getting into complications of integrals

## Vocabulary
- Quickie:
	- What does "discrete" mean?"
		- (professor said to look it up)
		- "branch of mathematics dealing with objects that can assume only distinct, separated values." [^1]
