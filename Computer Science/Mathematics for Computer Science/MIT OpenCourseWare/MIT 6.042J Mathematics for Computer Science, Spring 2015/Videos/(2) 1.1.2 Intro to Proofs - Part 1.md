- Rudimentary proofs (proofs are totally right)
## Getting started: Pythagorean Theorem
- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 2.26.31 PM.png|100]]
- If you have a right triangle with sides a and b and hypotenuse c, then there's a relationship between a, b and c $$a^2 + b^2 = c^2$$
	- It is familiar to us but not obvious

## Cool Proof
- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 2.30.40 PM.png]]
- 4 triangles that are the same size
- Square that is of unknown size
- Rearrange into: 
	- (i) a $c \times c$ square
		- Reassemble to make this square with the triangles

			- Letting b side be the longer of the 2 sides on the triangle
			- a is the shorter side of the other triangle
			- We learn it has to be a "b-a" square from this arrangement

	- (ii) an $a\times a$ & a $b \times b$ 
		- This is a second arrangement of 2 squares

			- Square on the left side is $a \times a$ and the square on the right side is $b \times b$ and we've proved the pythagorean theorem here. 
- Then by conservation of paper or area, it has to be that the $c \times c$ area is the same as the $a \times a$ area and $b \times b$ area.
