	- Error Detection and Correction
		- Description
			- Suppose we wanted to reliably transmit the result of a single coin flip: 
				- Heads: "0" 
				- Tails: "1"
			- Further suppose that during processing a single-bit error occurs, i.e., a single "0" is turned into a "1" or a "1" is turned into a "0".
	- Hamming Distance
		- Description
			- HAMMING DISTANCE: The number of positions in which the corresponding digits differ in two encodings of the same length.
				- Differs in 2 positions so Hamming distance is 2
	- Hamming Distance & Bit Errors
		- Description
			- The Hamming distance between a valid binary code word and the same code word with a single- bit error is 1.
			- The problem with our simple encoding is that the two valid code words ("O" and "1") also have a Hamming distance of 1. So a single-bit error changes a valid code word into another valid code word...
			- "heads" (0) $\leftrightarrow$ 1 "tails"
				- single-bit error
	- Single-bit Error Detection
		- Description
			- What we need is an encoding where a single-bit error does not produce another valid code word.
			- A parity bit can be added to any length message and is chosen to make the total number of "1" bits even (aka "even parity"). If min HD(code words) = 1, then min HD(code words + parity) = 2.

	- Parity check = Detect Single-bit errors
		- Description
			- To check for a single-bit error (actually any odd number of errors), count the number of 1s in the received message and if it's odd, there's been an error.
				- 01100101001 1 → original word with parity
				- 011000010011 → single-bit error (detected)
				- 011000110011 → 2-bit error (not detected)
			- One can "count" by summing the bits in the word modulo 2 (which is equivalent to XOR'ing the bits together).
	- Detecting Multi-bit Errors
		- Description
			- To detect E errors, we need a minimum Hamming distance of E+1 between code words.
				- With this encoding, we can detect up to two bit errors. Note that HD(000,111) = 3...
