	- Single-bit Error Correction
		- By increasing the Hamming distance between valid code words to 3, we guarantee that the sets of words produced by single-bit errors don't overlap. So assuming at most one error, we can perform error correction since we can tell what the valid code was before the error happened.
		- To correct E errors, we need a minimum Hamming distance of 2E+1 between code words.
