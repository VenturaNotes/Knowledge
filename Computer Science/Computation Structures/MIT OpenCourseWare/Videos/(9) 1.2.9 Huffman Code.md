	- Can We Do Better?
		- Description
			- Huffman's Algorithm constructed an optimal encoding... does that mean we can't do better?
			- To get a more efficient encoding (closer to information content) we need to encode sequences of choices, not just each choice individually. This is the approach taken by most file compression algorithms....
			- Using Huffman's Algorithm on pairs:
				- Average bits/symbol = 1.646 bits
			- Lookup "LZW" on Wikipedia
