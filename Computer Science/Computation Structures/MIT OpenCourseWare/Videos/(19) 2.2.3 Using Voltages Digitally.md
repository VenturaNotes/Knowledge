	- The Digital Abstraction
		- Description
			- "Ideal" Abstract World
				- 0/1 Bits
			- Real World
				- Volts or Electrons or Ergs or Gallons
				- Manufacturing Variations
				- Noise
			- Keep in mind that the world is not digital, we would simply like to engineer it to behave that way. Furthermore, we must use real physical phenomena to implement digital designs!
	- Using Voltages "Digitally"
		- Description
			- Key idea: encode only one bit of information: 2 values "0", "1"
			- Use the same uniform representation convention for every component and wire in our digital system
			- Hard to distinguish $V_{TH}-\upvarepsilon$ from $V_{TH}+\upvarepsilon$
			- Attempt #1
				- $V <V_{TH}$ is interpreted as "0"
				- $V \ge V_{TH}$ is interpreted an "1"
				- volts
			- Attempt #2
				- $V \le V_{L}$ is interpreted as "0"
				- $V_L < V < V_H$ is "Forbidden to ask"
				- $V \ge V_{H}$ is interpreted an "1"
				- volts
