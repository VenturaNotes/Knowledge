	- Concrete Encoding of Information
		- Description
			- To this point we've discussed encoding information using bits. But where do bits come from?
			- If we're going to design a machine that manipulates information, how should that information be physically encoded?
			- What makes a good bit?
				- small, inexpensive (we want a lot of them)
				- stable (reliable, repeatable)
				- ease and speed of manipulation
				- (access, transform, combine, transmit, store)
			- Rosetta Stone and DNA
	- Let's Use Electrical Phenomenon
		- Description
			- Consider using phenomenon associated with charged particles:
				- Voltages, phase, currents, frequency
			- In this course well use voltages to encode information. But the best choice depends on the intended application..
			- Voltage pros:
				- easy generation, detection
				- lots of engineering knowledge
				- potentially zero power in steady state
			- Voltage cons:
				- easily affected by environment
				- DC connectivity required?
				- R & C effects slow things down
