	- Representing Information with Voltage
		- Description
			- Representation of each `(x,y)` point on a B&W image:
				- 0 volts: BLACK
				- 1 volt: WHITE
				  0.37 volts: 37% GRAY
			- How much information at each point?
			- Suppose we can reliably distinguish voltages that differ by $1/2^N$ volts. Then we can represent N bits of information by voltages in the range 0V to 1V. What are realistic values for N?
	- Using Voltages to Encode a Picture
		- Description
			- Image from John Phelan (CC BY 3.0)
			- Representation of a picture:
				- Scan points in some prescribed raster order... 
				- Generate voltage waveform:
			- NTSC TV signal (white, black, sync)
	- Information Processing = Computation
		- Description
			- Why have processing blocks?
			- Pre-packaged functionality: rely on behavior without having to be an analog engineer
			- Predictable composition of functions
				- Tinker-toy assembly
			- Guaranteed behavior:
				- if components work, system will work!
			- Wow, rules simple enough for a programmer to follow!
	- Let's Build a System!
		- Description
			- Reality Output vs In Theory Output

	- Why Did Our System Fail?
		- Description
			- Why doesn't theory match reality?
				- (1) COPY block doesn't work right
				- (2) INV block doesn't work right
				- (3) Theory is imperfect
				- (4) Reality is imperfect
				- (5) Our system architecture stinks
			- Answer: All of the above!
				- Noise and inaccuracy are inevitable; we can't reliably reproduce infinite information - we must design our system to tolerate some amount of error if it is to process information reliably.
