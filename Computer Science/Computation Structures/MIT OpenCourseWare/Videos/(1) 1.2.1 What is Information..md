	- Intro
		- To build circuits to manipulate, transmit or store information, we are going to need some engineering tools to see if we're choosing a good representation for the information.
		- Will study different ways of encoding information as bits and learn the mathematics that help us determine if our encoding is a good one
		- Will also look into what to do if our representation gets corrupted by errors (detect something bad has happened and possibly correct the problem)
	- Slide 1: What is information?
		- From an engineering perspective
			- [[Information]], n. Data communicated or received that resolves uncertainty about a particular fact or circumstance. 
				- In other words, after receiving the data, we'll know more about that particular fact or circumstance
				- The greater the uncertainty resolved by the data, the more information the data has conveyed
		- Example: you receive some data about a card drawn at random from a 52-card deck. Which of the following data conveys the most information? The Least?
			- Without any data about the chosen card, there are 52 possibilities for the type of card.
			- Number of possibilities remaining
				- (a) The card is a heart (13 possibilities remaining)
				- (b) The card is not the Ace of spades (51 possibilities remaining)
					- #comment Conveys least information
				- (c) The card is a face card (J, Q, K) (12 possibilities remaining)
				- (d) The card is the "suicide king" (1 possibility remaining)
					- #comment Conveys most information
					- This is a particular card where the king is sticking a sword through his head. No uncertainty here, we know exactly what the choice was
			- So which of the possible pieces of data conveys the most information? In other words, which data resolves the most uncertainty about the chosen card?
