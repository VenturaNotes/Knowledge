	- Encoding Signed Integers
		- Description
			- We use a signed magnitude representation for decimal numbers, encoding the sign of the number (using "+" and " ") separately from its magnitude (using decimal digits).
			- We could adopt that approach for binary representations:
			- But: two representations for 0 (+0, -0) and we'd need different circuitry for addition and subtraction
	- Two's Complement Encoding
		- Description
			- In a two's complement encoding, the high-order bit of the N-bit representation has negative weight:
				- Negative numbers have "1" in the high-order bit
				- Most negative number
				- Most positive number
				- If all bits are 1
				- If all bits are 0
			- "sign bit"
			- Range: $-2^{N-1} \text{ to } 2^{N-1} -1$ 
	- More Two's Complement
		- Description
			- Let's see what happens when we add the N-bit values for -1 and 1, keeping an N-bit answer:
				- Just use ordinary binary addition, even when one or both of the operands are negative. 2's complement is perfect for N-bit arithmetic!
			- To compute B-A, we'll just use addition and compute B+(-A). But how do we figure out the representation for -A?
				- To negate a two's complement value: bitwise complement and add 1.
