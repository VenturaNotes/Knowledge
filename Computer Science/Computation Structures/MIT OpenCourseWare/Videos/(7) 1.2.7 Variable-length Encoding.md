	- Variable-length Encodings
		- Description
			- We'd like our encodings to use bits efficiently:
				- GOAL: When encoding data we'd like to match the length of the encoding to the information content of the data.
			- On a practical level this means:
				- Higher probability → shorter encodings
				- Lower probability → longer encodings
			- Such encodings are termed variable-length encodings.
	- Example
		- Description
			- High Probability, less information $\leftrightarrow$ Low probability, more information
			- Expected length of this encoding:
			- Expected length for 1000 symbols:
				- With fixed-length, 2 bits/symbol = 2000 bits
				- With variable-length code = 1667 bits
				- Lower bound (entropy) = 1626 bits
