	- Huffman's Algorithm
		- Description
			- Given a set of symbols and their probabilities, constructs an optimal variable-length encoding.
			- Huffman's Algorithm:
				- Build subtree using 2 symbols with lowest $p_i$
				- At each step choose two symbols/subtrees with lowest $p_i$, combine to form new subtree
				- Result: optimal tree built from the bottom-up
