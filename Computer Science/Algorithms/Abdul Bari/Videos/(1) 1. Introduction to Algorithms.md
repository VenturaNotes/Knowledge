- Important for GATE exams and competitive programming
- An algorithm is a step by step procedure for solving a computational problem.
- A program is also a step by step procedure for solving a problem.
- Software developer lifecycle
	- Phases of developing a software project
		- Design Phase
		- Implementation Phase
	- Whenever you want to manufacture or construct something by engineering procedures. One of the important steps is designing. First you know designing, make your design perfect and thorough so that you can understand what you're going to construct and develop. Then you show what you'll develop and then you'll start development.
	- You can't develop anything, you can't construct anything on a trial and error basis. You construct something, it's wrong. You destroy it and then create a new one. Don't do that. This is easy in software engineering though because you can write a program, change your mind, delete the program, and then start again your program. That's why we can't get the feel that we've wasted time in writing a useless program
	- First you design and then you write the program.
	- At the design time, what do you use? We write it in simple English like statements that are easy to understand without using proper syntax and not writing on machine that is on computer. We write on paper. You would not be writing in a language, you could write in MS word or notepad-like application. This is so you're familiar with how the program is going to work. That is an algorithm
- What do you call someone who does designing with a program? The person should have the domain knowledge. The problem knowledge. Knowledge of the problem and its solution. The person who understands the problem and has the domain knowledge can give a solution.
- If developing a software or algorithm or program for accounting. An accountant can understand accounting better. If writing application for hospital, then doctors or administrative staff of hospital can understand system better than a programmer. The one who has a knowledge of the domain for which the application is being developed, they can write the algorithm
- Team of programmers working on project should be able to understand the design. 
- [[Algorithm]]
	- They are written at <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">design time.</mark>
		- First you make a design what your procedure/software is going to do. Come up with a design that will be converted into a program.
	- Person needs <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">domain knowledge</mark>
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Any language</mark> can be used to write an algorithm.
		- Like english language or mathematical notations (better to use math notations)
		- Must be understandable by those people who are using the design. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Hardware and software independent</mark>
		- H/W & OS
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Analyze</mark>
- [[Program]]
	- Written at <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">implementation</mark> time
	- Person writing the program is the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">programmer</mark>
		- Programmers can also have domain knowledge though.
	- Should be written in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">programming language</mark>
		- Such as C/C++/Java/Python
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Dependent on Hardware and software</mark>
		- Must select operating system (such as Linux or Windows)
		- Method will be different because environments are different
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Testing</mark> of the program
- After writing an algorithm, we analyze the algorithm. Will study the algorithm to find out if we're achieving the results perfectly and if the algorithm is efficient or not in terms of time and space
- Syntax of language we use is at least C language (in reference to University Graduates)
- In the name of algorithms, we write in C language programs only.
	- Advantage is that everyone knows C language now. (this is so everyone can understand. At a school level, C language is being taught.)
