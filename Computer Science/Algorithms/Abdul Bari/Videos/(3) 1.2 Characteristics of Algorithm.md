	- Characteristics of [[Algorithm]]
		- (1) Input: 0 or more
		- (2) Output: at least 1 output (o/p)
		- (3) Definiteness: Every statement must give clear meaning. Can't have $\sqrt{-1}$ when dealing with real numbers.
		- (4) Finiteness: Not a service. It's an algorithm, a procedure. Must stop at some point

		- (5) Effectiveness: No unnecessary statements
