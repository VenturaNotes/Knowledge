	- How to write an algorithm
```
Method #1
Algorithm swap(a, b)
{
	temp = a;
	a = b;
	b = temp;
}

Method #2
Algorithm swap(a, b)
Begin
	temp := a; //This assignment symbol was used in Pascal language
	a := b;
	b := temp;
end

Method #3
Algorithm swap(a, b)
Begin
	temp <-- a; //Shows value of a stored in temp
	a <-- b;
	b <-- temp;
end

```
- Wrote "algorithm" to show you're writing an algorithm. Not a program
- Have not written the data type of parameters
	- Will only consider data types required when writing a program
- No temporary variable declaration (with algorithms, we don't bother with things related to language)
- There is no fixed syntax for writing any algorithm
