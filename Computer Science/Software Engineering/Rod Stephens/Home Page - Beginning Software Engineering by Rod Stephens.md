## About the Author
- Rod Stephens started out as a mathematician and studied at MIT
## About the Technical Editor
- “John Mueller is a freelance author and technical editor. He has writing in his blood, having produced 122 books and more than 600 articles to date.” ([Stephens, p. vii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=9&annotation=U2MCTSCQ))
## Introduction
- “To produce applications that are effective, safe, and reliable, you can’t just sit down and start typing. You need a plan. You need . . . $<$drumroll$>$ . . . [[Software Engineering]].” ([Stephens, p. xxvii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=29&annotation=845M74JL))
- ““Yeah, we mostly use [[scrum]] with a few extra [[XP]] techniques thrown in.”” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=7Z7ID6ER))
## What is Software Engineering?
- [[Software Engineering]]
	- ““An organized, analytical approach to the design, development, use, and maintenance of software.”” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=2NAII5ZT))
- “[[Software]] isn’t physical. It exists only in the virtual world of the computer.” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=523P3TFY))
	- “it’s easy to make changes to any part of a program even after it is completely written.” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=MX3VW4XX))
		- At least compared to aerospace engineering
- “The flexibility granted to software by its virtual nature is both a blessing and a curse.” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=PV626X8Z))
- “lets you refine the program during development to better meet user needs” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=6IX923E6))
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Advantages of software engineering</mark>
	- “lets you refine the program during development to better meet user needs, add new features to take advantage of opportunities discovered during implementation, and make modifications to meet evolving business requirements.” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=W9W2Y7DY))
		- “Some applications even allow users to write scripts to perform new tasks never envisioned by the developers.” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=4LC43X7V))
			- This is probably what plugins are?
- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Disadvantages of software engineering</mark>
	- “Adding a new feature can break existing code or turn a simple, elegant design into a confusing mess” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=XBTU93UE))
	- “adding, removing, and modifying features during development can make it impossible for different parts of the system to work together.” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=MD2FTEXX))
	- “make it impossible to tell when the project is finished.” ([Stephens, p. xxviii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=30&annotation=TYB8UL8Z))
- “[[Microsoft Word]], for example, has been evolving for roughly 40 years” ([Stephens, p. xxix](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=31&annotation=HF3US8F5))
- “you need to consider the whole development process as a single, long, complex task” ([Stephens, p. xxix](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=31&annotation=NP4WI6EK))
## Why is Software Engineering Important?
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Ways it can go wrong</mark>
	- “Programmers may not understand what users want or need (which may be two separate things), so they build the wrong application.” ([Stephens, p. xxix](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=31&annotation=PPF48RTG))
	- “program might be so full of bugs that it’s frustrating to use, impossible to fix, and can’t be enhanced over time.” ([Stephens, p. xxix](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=31&annotation=49ZJGM3K))
	- “program could be completely effective but so confusing that you need a PhD in puzzle-solving to use it.” ([Stephens, p. xxix](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=31&annotation=XJL93KLY))
	- “perfect application could even be killed by internal business politics or market forces.” ([Stephens, p. xxix](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=31&annotation=VR5R5P95))

- To produce software
	- “These are things such as gathering requirements, building a plan, and actually writing the code.” ([Stephens, p. xxx](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=32&annotation=C2S9QRE5))
- “The second part of the book describes some of the more popular ''[[software development approaches]].” ([Stephens, p. xxx](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=32&annotation=T8NPKULP))
	- “Some focus on predictability so that you know exactly what features will be provided and when.” ([Stephens, p. xxxi](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=33&annotation=SA39PDL8))
	- “Others focus on creating the most features as quickly as possible, even if that means straying from the original design.” ([Stephens, p. xxxi](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=33&annotation=8ZCFFE3R))
	- Most popular [[Development Models|development models]] will be described in chapters 17 through 19
- “Chapter 20 discusses [[software ethics]].” ([Stephens, p. xxxi](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=33&annotation=DCJSQP4U))
- “First learn the tasks that you need to complete to deliver useful software. Next, learn how different models handle those tasks. Then finish with some more thoughtful material.” ([Stephens, p. xxxi](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=33&annotation=7J9DFH3L))
- “All of the solutions are included in the Appendix.” ([Stephens, p. xxxi](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=33&annotation=ADMKXNUT))
## What This Book Covers (And What It Doesn't)
- “This book describes software engineering, the tasks that you must perform to successfully complete a software project, and some of the most popular developer models that you can use to try to achieve your goals.” ([Stephens, p. xxxi](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=33&annotation=XUT5J7N8))
- “it barely scratches the surface of the dozens (possibly hundreds) of models that are in use in the software industry.” ([Stephens, p. xxxi](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=33&annotation=PQWBWACL))
	- “book describes only some of the most popular development approaches and then only relatively briefly.” ([Stephens, p. xxxi](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=33&annotation=EUUFXQ3S))
- “Many development models also have their own organizations with websites dedicated to their promotion. For example, see www.extremeprogramming.org, https://agilemanifesto.org, and www.scrum.org.” ([Stephens, p. xxxi](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=33&annotation=5WG9LIZS))
	- [[extreme programming]]
	- [[agile manifesto]]
	- [[scrum]]
- “It describes some general ideas and concepts that make it easier to build robust software, but its focus is on higher-level software engineering issues” ([Stephens, p. xxxi](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=33&annotation=SPCH8NIT))
- Doesn't talk about language-specific tools or techniques
## What Tools Do you Need?
- “If you’re working on a small, one-person project, you might need only a programming environment such as [[Jupyter Notebook]], [[Visual Studio]], [[Eclipse]], [[RAD Studio]]” ([Stephens, p. xxxii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=34&annotation=CHBXM8PC))
- “For<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> larger team efforts</mark>, you’ll also need tools for<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> project management, documentation (word processors), change tracking, software revision tracking</mark>, and more.” ([Stephens, p. xxxii](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=34&annotation=6HJ54II6))
## Part 1 Software Engineering Step-by-step
- “they all perform roughly the same tasks. They all determine what the software should do and how it should do it.” ([Stephens, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=38&annotation=838K9UW9))
	- “the [[waterfall]] and [[V-model]] approaches, use detailed requirement specifications to exactly define the desired results before development begins.” ([Stephens, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=38&annotation=MU2D5RM3))
	- “as [[Scrum]] and [[agile]] techniques, rely on fast-paced incremental development with frequent feedback to keep a project on track.” ([Stephens, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=38&annotation=L7FBNS7S))
	- “other techniques, such as [[cowboy coding]] and [[extreme programming]]” ([Stephens, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=38&annotation=BPBH5HJ6))
- “I call these basic items “tasks” and not “stages” or “steps”” ([Stephens, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=38&annotation=9WE3ASG7))

## (1) Software Engineering from 20,000 Feet
### Requirements Gathering
- [[Requirements Gathering]]
- Tells project members what they should do, when, how long to do it, project's goals. Gives direction
- What the customers want/needs
	- Can be time consuming depending on how well-defined the user's needs are
- Need to identify customers (interact with them as much as possible to design the most useful application possible)
	- Could be for another part of your own company
	- May have a vague notion and won't know until you start marketing
	- Could be for yourself
- A customer's wants and needs are not always the same.
	- Once determined, turn them into [[requirements documents]]
		- Tells customers whet they'll get and the project members what they're building
	- Requirements don't include customer suggestions, developer complaints, and management wishful thinking until they're approve by the powers that be.
- Requests must add value to the project and must be done in a timely manner.
	- Could defer it for a later release.
- “Because software is so malleable, users frequently ask for new features up to the day before the release party.” ([Stephens, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=41&annotation=XT8752RN))

### High-Level Design
- [[High-level design]]
	- What [[platform]] to use
		- Desktop, laptop, tablet, or phone
	- [[Data design]]
		- [[Direct access]], [[2-tier]], or [[3-tier]]
	- Interfaces with other systems
		- external purchasing systems
		- Payroll system hosted in the cloud
	- Information about [[project architecture]]
		- Break project into large chunks that handle the project's major areas of functionality
		- May include 
			- list of modules you need to build
			- list of families of classes
- Example
	- “system to manage the results of ostrich races” ([Stephens, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=41&annotation=WL3ZBC5C))
		- [[Database]] (to hold the data)
		- [[class (Computer Science)|Classes]] (Race, Ostrich, Jockey, and Wager classes)
		- [[User Interfaces]] (enter Ostrich and Jockey data, race results, calculate odds, produce result reports, create new races)
		- “[[External interfaces]] (to send information and spam to participants and fans via email, text message, voicemail, pager, carrier pigeon, and anything else we can think of)” ([Stephens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=42&annotation=YTJ54K5B))
- High-level design
	- “covers every aspect of the requirements” ([Stephens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=42&annotation=NBR5EDLW))
	- “should specify what the pieces do and how they should interact, but it should include as few details as possible about how the pieces do their jobs.” ([Stephens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=42&annotation=97BVIUMF))
- “extreme programming, Scrum, and other [[incremental development approaches]] may be rolling their eyes” ([Stephens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=42&annotation=H2S4DNW5))
	- Incremental development approaches don't necessarily believe in high-level design
### Low-Level Design
- “[[low-level design]] includes information about how that piece of the project should work.” ([Stephens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=42&annotation=L2Z9LKXN))
	- “should give enough guidance to the developers who will implement those pieces.” ([Stephens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=42&annotation=NRVE3EPN))
- Example
	- Ostrich racing application's database piece includes an initial design for database
	- Should sketch out tables that will hold race, ostrich and jockey information using
		- [[first normal form]], [[second normal form]], and [[third normal form]] (may need higher forms of normalization)
			- These are forms of [[Normalization]]
- “the [[printing module]] will be easier if you add a new stored procedure to the database design.” ([Stephens, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=42&annotation=NDF53CYZ))
### Development
- It's time for [[development]] after
	- (1) Gathering requirements
	- (2) Creating high-level designs
	- (3) Refining high-level designs to low-level designs
	- (4) Development (where many programmers believe the real work begins)
- Development technique
	- “keep refining the design to give more and more detail until it would be easier to just write the code instead.” ([Stephens, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=43&annotation=I45NFUA7))
	- “As the programmers write the code, they test it to make sure it doesn’t contain any bugs.” ([Stephens, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=43&annotation=LGHECULC))
		- “It’s a programming axiom that no nontrivial program is completely bug-free.” ([Stephens, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=43&annotation=ZPCBN9BQ))
			- “As the programmers write the code, they test it to find and remove as many bugs as they reasonably can.” ([Stephens, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=43&annotation=EV4UI97T))

### Testing
- [[Testing]]
- “First developers test their own code. Then testers who didn’t write the code test it. After a piece of code seems to work properly, it is integrated into the rest of the project, and the whole thing is tested to see if the new code broke anything.” ([Stephens, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=43&annotation=AA7KKXDS))
- When fixing a bug
	- Often creates new bugs
	- Sometimes bug fix is incorrect
	- Sometimes breaks another piece of code that depended on buggy behavior
		- known bug hides an unknown bug
- “Anytime you change the code, whether by adding new code or fixing old code, you need to test it to make sure everything works as it should.” ([Stephens, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=43&annotation=33CMVBJQ))
- “If bugs don’t bother users too frequently or too severely when they do occur, then you’re ready to move on to deployment.” ([Stephens, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=44&annotation=DZHZ54G5))
- You could have up to 15 possible mistakes if there is 1 mistake in the requirements gathering task. This is because 2 mistakes may propagate every subsequent task resulting in 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 = 15 possible mistakes
	- “One early mistake can lead to many later mistakes.” ([Stephens, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=44&annotation=G3IRXHX7))
	- “The longer a bug remains undetected, the harder it is to fix.” ([Stephens, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=45&annotation=ZDELZ45G))
- “Actually, testing is critical at every stage of development to ensure the resulting application is usable.” ([Stephens, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=45&annotation=CBUXQXRY))
### Deployment
- [[Deployment]]
- It can involve the following ^9f6fa5
	- New computers for [[backend database]] 
		- Not necessary for cloud-base projects
	- A new [[network]]
	- New computers for the users
		- Not necessary for cloud-based projects
	- User training
	- On-site support while the users get to know the new system
	- “[[Parallel operations]] while some users get to know the new system and other users keep using the old system” ([Stephens, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=45&annotation=P63ZZKL6))
	- “Special [[data maintenance]] chores to keep the old and new databases synchronized” ([Stephens, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=45&annotation=8LTWAJ6T))
	- “Massive bug fixing” ([Stephens, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=45&annotation=AHWC98YM))
	- Other nonsense that no one could predict (unexpected tasks)
		- “I worked on one project that assigned repair people to fix customer problems for a phone company. Twice during live testing, the system assigned someone to work at his ex-wife’s house.” ([Stephens, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=46&annotation=JGHCZH9C))
### Maintenance
- [[Maintenance]]
- Software axiom:
	- “Bugs that were completely hidden from testers appear the instant users touch the application” ([Stephens, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=46&annotation=79CP2M2T))
- “More than one billion people use Microsoft Office products” ([Stephens, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=46&annotation=SNWW7BGD))
- “This is the kind of problem every software developer wants to have: customers that like an application so much, they’re clamoring for more.” ([Stephens, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=46&annotation=2MMVQGMK))
	- Including enhancements, improvements, and new features
### Wrap-Up
- [[Wrap Up]]
- “You need to perform a postmortem. You need to evaluate the project and decide what went right and what went wrong.” ([Stephens, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=46&annotation=R8E6ZDAH))
	- Best to do before everyone forgets any lessons that you can learn from the project
### Everything All At Once
- “many of the basic tasks overlap—and sometimes in big ways.” ([Stephens, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=47&annotation=T7GQRDKR))
- “Several people can work with the customers to define the requirements.” ([Stephens, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=47&annotation=433KKZKF))
	- Takes more coordination but saves a lot of time on big projects
- “as requirements gathering nears completion, you should finalize the high-level designs so team members can move on to low-level designs and possibly even some programming.” ([Stephens, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=47&annotation=V67GVP5X))
	- “In the worst case, testing of “finished” code may reveal fundamental flaws in the early designs and even the requirements.” ([Stephens, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=47&annotation=32D7XYNT))
- “The first project I worked on was an [[inventory system]] for NAVSPECWARGRU.” ([Stephens, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=48&annotation=IP3RCZ66))
- “Some development models rely on a specification that’s extremely detailed and rigid.” ([Stephens, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=48&annotation=JBXDQYJB))
- “[[Iterative approaches]] even repeat the same basic tasks many times to build ever-improving versions of the final application.” ([Stephens, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=48&annotation=K66X9YPA))
### Summary
- “[[agile methods]] and [[test-driven development]] use frequent builds to force developers to perform a lot of tests early on so that they can catch bugs as quickly as possible.” ([Stephens, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=48&annotation=DKIJEQD8))
### Exercises
- (1) The basic tasks all software engineering projects must handle are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">requirements gathering, high-level design, low-level design, development, testing, deployment, maintenance, and wrap-up. </mark>. (Total of 8 basic tasks)
- (2) Description of each exercise
	- [[Requirements Gathering]]: Learn the customer's wants and needs ^yw6pun
	- [[High-Level Design]]: Describe the major pieces of the application and how they interact
	- [[Low-Level Design]]: Provide more detail about how to build the pieces of the application so that the programmers can actually implement them.
	- [[Development]]: Write code to implement the application
	- [[Testing]]: Use the application under different circumstances to try to detect any flaws or bugs.
	- [[Deployment]]: Roll out the application to the users
	- [[Maintenance]]: Implement bug fixes, additions, enhancements, and future versions of the program
	- [[Wrap-up]]: Evaluate the project's history to determine what went right and what went wrong so that you can repeat the good things and avoid the bad things in future projects.
- (3) Explain which tasks are performed in the interaction given
	- “Coding without proper design is a bad habit.” ([Stephens, p. 560](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=596&annotation=S3CBKN69))
		- Can get away with it using small examples
	- “The customer just wants the basic techniques and can fill in things such as [[error handling]], big [[user interfaces]], and [[documentation]].” ([Stephens, p. 560](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=596&annotation=497EJ7V8))
		- In example given
- (4) List three ways fixing one [[bug]] can cause others
	- Bug fix may be incorrect
	- Bug fix may break other code depended on original buggy behavior
	- Bug fix might change correct behavior to a new correct behavior affecting code that may depend on original behavior
- (5) [[(1) Software Engineering from 20,000 Feet#^9f6fa5|Five tasks part of deployment]]
- (6) Are customers more likely to find bugs than testers because they spend more time on using the program?
	- Not necessarily since testers are intentionally trying to break the program and they typically know how it was built
- (7) What happens if each bug leads to 3 others?
	- Tasks
		- Requirements Gathering = 1 bug
		- High-level design = 3 bugs
		- Low-Level design = 9 bugs
		- Development = 27 bugs
	- 1 + 3 + 9 + 27 = <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">40</mark>

### What You Learned in This Chapter
- All projects perform the same basic 8 tasks
- “Different development models handle the basic tasks in different ways, such as making some less formal or repeating tasks many times.” ([Stephens, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=50&annotation=IABN4XGR))
- “The basic tasks often occur at the same time” ([Stephens, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=50&annotation=H33CYE3W))
- “Work sometimes flows backward with later tasks requiring changes to earlier tasks” ([Stephens, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=50&annotation=ICHQBKB2))
- “Fixing a bug can lead to other bugs.” ([Stephens, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=50&annotation=VMI5TWI2))
- “The longer a mistake remains undetected, the harder it is to fix.” ([Stephens, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=50&annotation=WBBJEQ3X))
- “Surprises are inevitable, so you should allow some extra time to handle them.” ([Stephens, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=50&annotation=LGBVMAQ4))
## (2) Before the Beginning
### What You Will Learn
- Main learning points
	- “The features that a [[document management system]] provides” ([Stephens, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=51&annotation=TQ3U6LFR))
	- “Why [[documentation]] is important” ([Stephens, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=51&annotation=AN9YE33R))
	- “How you can easily archive emails for later use” ([Stephens, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=51&annotation=MTTX28VK))
	- “Typical types of documentation” ([Stephens, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=51&annotation=8BH66AMT))
- “beginning-to-end tools that you can use to help keep team members focused and the project on track.” ([Stephens, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=52&annotation=NXQ34TFW))
### Document Management
- [[Document Management]]
- “It uses[[ requirements documents]], [[use cases]], [[design documents]], [[test plans]], [[user training material]], lunch menus for team-building exercises, resumes if the project doesn’t go well, and much more.” ([Stephens, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=52&annotation=YFGFFEIT))
- “many of those are “living” documents that evolve over time.” ([Stephens, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=52&annotation=C5X7DQ2I))
	- “customers may want to revise the requirements to include new, simple features and eliminate old, complicated features.” ([Stephens, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=52&annotation=EGD2Y6CG))
- “To keep changes from proliferating wildly and becoming hopelessly convoluted, many projects (particularly large ones) create a [[change control board]] that reviews and approves (or rejects) change requests.” ([Stephens, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=52&annotation=3BGTIL2Q))
	- Board should include people who represent customers and the development team
	- “usually worthwhile to assign someone as the final arbiter.” ([Stephens, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=52&annotation=TNG6IYC4))
		- “Often that person is either a high-ranking customer (such as the[[Executive Champion]]) or a high-ranking member of the development team (such as the [[project lead]]).” ([Stephens, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=52&annotation=8UJ4XV2J))
- “<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">You need to easily find the most recent version of the requirements to see what the application should do.</mark>” ([Stephens, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=53&annotation=DQLG4MDZ))
- “<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Sometimes, you’ll also need to find older versions of the documentation, to find out what changes were made, why they were made, and who to blame for them.</mark>” ([Stephens, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=53&annotation=R2YJ7PGM))
- “Unless you have a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">good document history</mark>, you may never know why and when the requirement was changed, so you won’t know whether it’s okay to change it again.” ([Stephens, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=53&annotation=6UBUCBV4))
- “If you both open the document at the same time, whichever change is saved second will overwrite the other change, and the first change will be lost. (In programming terms, this is called a [[race condition]] in which the second person wins.)” ([Stephens, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=53&annotation=KNVL6IM6))
- Features of a [[document management system]]
	- Common
		- Shared documents that are editable
		- One person can edit a document at a time
		- Can fetch most recent version of document
		- Fetch previous version of document through date or version number
		- Search document for tags and keywords
		- Compare two documents (for what, who, and when changed. "Why" is important too but less common feature)
		- Accessible over Internet or mobile devices
	- Less Common
		- Multiple people to collaborate on single document
		- Integration into other tools (Microsoft Office, Google workspace, project management software)
		- Split document into two paths for future change
		- User roles and restricted access lists
		- Email change notification
		- [[Workflow support]] and [[document routing]]
### Historical Documents
- [[Historical Documents]]
- “Every little tidbit and scrap of intelligence dealing with the project should be recorded for posterity.” ([Stephens, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=55&annotation=FUVXYB7E))
- “Every design decision, requirements change, and memo should be tucked away for later reference.” ([Stephens, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=55&annotation=ZXR7L4ME))
- “If you have a good, searchable document database, you can simply find the [[memo]]” ([Stephens, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=55&annotation=UEZTGYFM))
- Save these things
	- Emails
	- Change request
	- New document creations
- For meetings and phone calls, write a quick summary and email it to all the participants to thrash through any disagreements as soon as possible
### Email
- [[Email]]
- “Memos, discussions about possible change requests, meeting notes, and lunch orders are all easy to distribute via email.” ([Stephens, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=55&annotation=JEB8S8LU))
	- CC it for every project email
- “Suppose you’re working on project CLASP (CLeverly Acronymed Software Project). Then you would create an email account named CLASP and send copies of any project email to that account.” ([Stephens, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=55&annotation=XSVCJA26))
	- “Usually just having the emails saved in a project account is good enough.” ([Stephens, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=56&annotation=EK7CFB6H))
	- Can save project emails into text files for manipulations that may be tricky inside an email system
- “To make finding project emails easier, you can prefix their subjects with an identifier.” ([Stephens, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=56&annotation=KWQ47N9N))
	- “`[CLASP]` This week's meeting canceled because all tasks are ahead of schedule” ([Stephens, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=56&annotation=ULERVNYV))
		- This is prefixed with `[CLASP]`
- “You can further refine the subject identifier by adding classes of messages.” ([Stephens, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=56&annotation=HNV3XRJQ))
	- “You can invent any message classes you think would be useful.” ([Stephens, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=56&annotation=43PZJQG7))
- Handy [[message classes]]
	- `Admin`: Administration
	- `Rqts`: Requirements
	- `HLDesign`: High-level design
	- `LLDesign`: Low-level design
	- `Dvt`: Development
	- `Test`: Testing
	- `Deploy`: Deployment
	- `Doc`: Documentation
	- `Train`: Training
	- `Maint`: Maintenance
	- `Wrap`: Wrap-up
- “It doesn’t matter what subject line tags you use, as long as you’re consistent.” ([Stephens, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=56&annotation=PJ8ZWRYL))
- “could even break the identifier further to indicate tasks within a message class.” ([Stephens, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=57&annotation=54Y5I5VN))
	- “`CLASP.LLDesign.1001`” ([Stephens, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=57&annotation=YHBXGDM5)) could be about low-level design task 1001
- “Some email systems can even use rules to route particular messages to different folders.” ([Stephens, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=57&annotation=QX4R4ZPW))
- “An alternative strategy is to include keywords inside the message body.” ([Stephens, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=57&annotation=FLJQN96B))
	- Example
		- Key: Test
		- Key: Bugs
		- Key: Login
	- So now you can type Key: Bugs to find relevant messages
- “include Unicode emojis in message titles to indicate things such as the group to which it applies, messages that are suggestions, and messages that should remain private to the development team and should not be shared with customers.” ([Stephens, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=57&annotation=ZD4C6KP5))
- “Some email systems also let you assign icons to specific people so you can easily spot emails from them.” ([Stephens, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=57&annotation=MI5HANR2))
- “I worked on one project that had more Slack channels than team members.” ([Stephens, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=57&annotation=LFVJZG4E))
	- Such as groups for managers, user interface designers, customers, developers, testers, and trainers
- Make sure to send emails to correct group
	- “developers argue over whether a [[b+tree]] is better than an [[AVL-tree]]” ([Stephens, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=57&annotation=74PXHUZZ))
	- “user interface designers don’t want to hear the testers dispute the fine points of [[white-box]]versus [[beige-box testing]].” ([Stephens, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=57&annotation=JRGWJZX6))
- “I worked on one project that had more Slack channels than team members.” ([Stephens, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=57&annotation=LFVJZG4E))
### Code
- [[Source code control systems]] are different from document control systems since they continually change sometimes well beyond the project's official ending date.
- “A [[requirements document]] might go through a dozen or so versions, but a [[code module]] might include hundreds or even thousands of changes.” ([Stephens, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=58&annotation=3ALAMLPY))
- “[[Source code]] is also generally line-oriented.” ([Stephens, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=58&annotation=MN9IJ6U8))
	- “Even in curly bracket languages such as [[C Sharp]], [[Kotlin]], and [[Java]], which are technically not line-oriented, programmers insert line breaks to make the code easier to read.” ([Stephens, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=58&annotation=2J7F4FEZ))
- If you add a word to a paragraph that causes it to wrap around to the following line, a source code control system may say that you modified every line in the paragraph while Microsoft Word or Google Docs would notice you only added a single word.
- Source code control system should check out a module to a developer so that other developers can still use the most recently saved version of the code, but can't edit it to avoid the [[race condition]]
### Code Documentation
- [[Code Documentation]]
- “The reason I say source code is written for people is that it’s people who must write, understand, and debug the code.” ([Stephens, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=58&annotation=3GAXDYC5))
	- Needs to be understandable to the people who write and maintain it
- “Code documentation should include high- and low-level design documents that you can store in the document repository with other kinds of documentation. These provide an overview of the methods the code is using to do whatever it’s supposed to do.” ([Stephens, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=59&annotation=C7DJW8ZD))
	- Include both design documents and comments inside the code
- “There’s a school of thought in software engineering that says you should provide code documentation and comments that are “just barely good enough” ([[JBGE]]).” ([Stephens, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=59&annotation=NFWWGESM))
	- Reserved only for code comments
- “Some [[integrated development environments]] (IDEs) even let you hide comments, so you only see them when you want them.” ([Stephens, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=60&annotation=NCZB3PLS)) ^ao6afy
- “C# code with [[XML comments]]:” ([Stephens, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=61&annotation=N6SBYJYB))
```C#
/// <summary> Deny something bad we did to the media. </summary>
/// <param name="type"> What we did (Bug, Virus, PromisedBadFeature,etc)</param>
/// <param name= "urgency"> High, Medium, or Low, </param>
/// <param name = "media"> One or more of Blog, Facebook, Friendster, etc. </param>
private void PostDenial(DenialType type, UrgencyType urgency, MediaType media)
{
...
}
```
- Summary token explains method's purpose
- param token describes method's parameters
- “The [[Visual Studio]] development environment can automatically extract these comments into an XML file that you can then process to produce documentation.” ([Stephens, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=61&annotation=SRCZFF9C))
	- “it does explain the interface that the method displays to other pieces of code.” ([Stephens, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=61&annotation=CHCZIHDC))
	- “Visual Studio also uses these comments to provide useful help pop-ups called [[IntelliCode]], formerly called IntelliSense, to other developers who call this code.)” ([Stephens, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=61&annotation=54YCGM2H))
- “Finish the method, test it, and then write the comments once.” ([Stephens, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=61&annotation=8SVWPF48))
### Application Documentation
- [[Application Documentation]]
- “All the documentation described so far deals with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">building the application</mark>” ([Stephens, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=61&annotation=JTW44GDM))
	- Includes requirements, design documents, code documentation, comments, meeting notes, phone call notes, memos
- “At some point you also need to prepare documentation that <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">describes the application</mark>” ([Stephens, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=61&annotation=TZAPGIJW))
- “Depending on the eventual number and kinds of users, you may need to write [[user manuals]](for [[end user|end users]], [[managers]], [[database administrators]], and more), [[quick start guides]], [[cheat sheets]], [[user interface maps]], [[training materials]], and [[marketing materials]].” ([Stephens, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=61&annotation=93QC4SZS))
	- “You may even need to write [[meta-training materials]] to teach the trainers how to train the end users” ([Stephens, p. 26](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=62&annotation=MLDLITSI))
- “In addition to basic printed versions, you may need to produce Internet, screencast, video, PowerPoint, audiobook, and other [[multimedia versions]] of some of those documents.” ([Stephens, p. 26](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=62&annotation=HD7PKW33))
	- May not be able to search for keywords in a video
- “If you wait until the last minute to start writing training materials, then the users won’t be able to use the application when it’s ready.” ([Stephens, p. 26](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=62&annotation=9PXUK4B4))

	- “Compare tool won’t know the word ever existed if you compare versions 1 and 3” ([Stephens, p. 562](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=598&annotation=B7TN3U3S))
	- “[[Compare tool]] is useful, however, if you have multiple versions of a document that don’t contain change tracking information.” ([Stephens, p. 562](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=598&annotation=BWGUWSUM))
- (4) “[[Google Docs]] provides some simple change [[tracking tool|tracking tools]]” ([Stephens, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=63&annotation=H7E5N55H))
	- “Google Docs also has revision-tracking tools that let you see who has modified a document and when” ([Stephens, p. 563](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=599&annotation=XUMHE7NL))
- (5) What is JBGE?
	- “JBGE stands for just barely good enough. It’s the philosophy that you shouldn’t write any more code documentation or comments than absolutely necessary.” ([Stephens, p. 562](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=598&annotation=DNSI46IV))
- (6) Why does CLASP example puts brackets around keywords?
	- “The brackets make it easier to search for projects that are part of the project rather than those that merely mention the project.” ([Stephens, p. 562](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=598&annotation=YIIP5T4R))
- (7) End-user documentation and training materials must reflect the final project. Do these parts begin only after the final project is finished?
	- You can start those kinds of documentation any time, but will require changing
	- Should start with higher level documents (such as [[executive summaries]]), which contain the least detail. Can write about [[user interface]] if partially designed as well
### What You Learned in This Chapter
- Documentation important every step of process
	- keeps team members on track, provides clear direction for work, prevents arguments over issues previously settled
- [[(2) Before the Beginning#^ba1692|Document Management systems enables the following]]
- To store project history, create an email account named after project and send copies of all project correspondence to account
	- Use email subject tags to find different types of emails more easily `CLASP.Rqts`
- Types of [[documentation]]
	- Requirements, project emails and memos, meeting notes, phone calls, use cases, high-level design documents, low-level design documents, test plans, code documentation, code comments, extractable code comments, user manuals, quick start guides, cheat sheets, user interface maps, training materials, meta-training materials, marketing materials
- “[[JBGE]] (just barely good enough) states that you should provide only the absolute minimum number of comments necessary to understand the code.” ([Stephens, p. 28](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=64&annotation=8VZPC3JN))

	- People may have different goals and live in different environments making every team unique
### Team Features
^b6cbf3

#### Clear Roles
- [[Clear roles]] means “It’s about knowing who should make which decisions and work on what tasks.” ([Stephens, p. 30](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=66&annotation=CDS3S6HZ))
- “it’s nice to have an official leader (team lead, project lead, executive champion) with the power to make decisions.” ([Stephens, p. 30](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=66&annotation=4XRHZS8F))

#### Effective Leadership
- [[Effective leadership]] is especially needed for larger teams
- “The leadership should do whatever is necessary to make the team as effective as possible and not break the team spirit by micromanaging every decision.” ([Stephens, p. 30](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=66&annotation=CR2Z3J4Y))

- [[Working Project Manager]]
	- manage the project
	- may be expected to provide technical guidance and code (best for small projects)
	- Large projects tend to make management full-time
	- When project progresses, working manager may need to offload some technical chores
- Good management needs trustworthiness
	- Ensures other good features described in chapter
#### Clear Goals
- “You can be inspired by commercial products, but don’t steal their designs” ([Stephens, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=68&annotation=V578KU5I))
- “If you don’t have existing models for what the program should do, you should spend some extra time “testing” the high-level design.” ([Stephens, p. 32](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=68&annotation=QHJN7WTZ))

	- Meetings should be short
- Peers working together important. Collaboration Software essential
#### Support for Risk-Taking
- “This is the concept of collaborative independence: members working independently to help the team achieve its goals.” ([Stephens, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=69&annotation=BTNIY695))
	- “make decisions and try new things within their pieces of the project to further the team’s goals.” ([Stephens, p. 33](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=69&annotation=USVMAM6B))

#### Roles Wrap-Up
- Know how many people you need. Assign roles. 
- Once you've selected a good fraction of the team, let them self-assemble. “the more the team builds itself, the more likely it will be to grow a strong, productive culture.” ([Stephens, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=73&annotation=4EXI2SB8))
### Team Culture
^f4b3d5
- A group of middle-aged NASA developers who've used the waterfall model for decades can be as productive as young agile developers at a startup [[e-commerce]] company
- “a good culture is one that makes the team effective” ([Stephens, p. 37](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=73&annotation=KUYSFY8C))
	- Team members should be comfortable working together, alone, discussing project's design and making group decisions
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">To build a team culture, you need group activities</mark>
	- Lunch, party, picnic, escape room, amusement park, ski/beach trip, hike, community service activities, professional conferences, lunch talks/lectures, activities where the team members can socialize
		- Don't make them mandatory (have company pay for event)
		- Swag like shirts, hats, jackets, coffee mugs helps build a team identity
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Toxic work culture</mark>
	- Sexual harassment, discrimination (race, age sexual orientation, anything other than ability), favorites, cliques + gossip, bad leadership, ignoring feedback, different rules among people, no work-life balance (long hours, burnout), frequent [[employee turnover]], bullying
- “A good leader ensures that the team gets what it needs to function efficiently.” ([Stephens, p. 39](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=75&annotation=CXL5QFCV))
	- “often it just requires explaining things properly to the powers that be.” ([Stephens, p. 39](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=75&annotation=KI737G6W))
### Interviews
- “interview puzzles and the bottom line.” ([Stephens, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=76&annotation=QCZEIB4G))
#### Interview Puzzles
- “In a word, don’t.” ([Stephens, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=76&annotation=KYIBUDGZ))
- [[UNIVAC]], [[Logicon]], and [[IBM]] reasoned that it took clever people to write clever programs so these companies decided to use interview puzzles to identify clever people and then train them to program
	- This was before in the 1950s and 1960s when there were no university degrees in software engineering or web design
- “Today big companies like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon no longer use programming puzzles (although they used to),” ([Stephens, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=76&annotation=TDKR5SHA))
- “What a programming puzzle does do is test whether you’ve seen that particular puzzle before.” ([Stephens, p. 40](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=76&annotation=LFNTBU2A))
#### The Bottom Line
- Interviews should resolve "Should the candidate take the job?"
	- Salary and benefits package?
	- Prospects for advancement?
	- Will I get along with these people?
- Try to meet as many team members as possible during the interview
- Interviewer must think: ““Will the team get along with this person?”” ([Stephens, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=77&annotation=XAJ7MMNR))
	- Candidate must be fit for the team's culture
- “you should try not to penalize someone who doesn’t do well in an interview setting.” ([Stephens, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=77&annotation=X2D7JHCT))
- “Work and character references may be able to help.” ([Stephens, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=77&annotation=MJPHRXY4))
	- Can team members work with this person?
### Physical Environment
- “Developers can’t do good work if they are uncomfortable, constantly distracted, or not distracted enough.” ([Stephens, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=77&annotation=GTY3U4G6))
#### Creativity
- “software engineering is a creative process.” ([Stephens, p. 41](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=77&annotation=FUR44RD9))
- The best developers use their creativity to find the best solutions to their customers' problems
	- “In [[execuspeak]], they synergize outside the box to shift paradigms and redefine core competencies.” ([Stephens, p. 42](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=78&annotation=P6V8FBST))
- Need balance between intense focus and distraction
- “During a long period of uninterrupted concentration, you can enter what psychologists call a [[flow state]] and the rest of us call the zone.” ([Stephens, p. 42](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=78&annotation=JAIHMPK2))
- Important to distract yourself from work sometimes so you don't develop tunnel vision on one approach to a problem
- The COVID-19 pandemic found that “Most people showed an increase in productivity due to fewer interruptions.” ([Stephens, p. 42](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=78&annotation=TDVNJFYB))
	- “At least they were more productive initially. After a few weeks, many were much less happy working remotely.” ([Stephens, p. 42](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=78&annotation=5GHZNTVB))
		- Humans are social creatures and need some interaction but some would be perfectly happy to work remotely forever
- Companies may review remote work as away to save on office costs
#### Office Space
- “The two most productive environments that I’ve worked in were openish. There was both privacy and distraction as needed.” ([Stephens, p. 43](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=79&annotation=PGXJZDMP))
	- Company could have individual offices but pieces of the team met very frequently and informally for coffee or lunch. If you wanted privacy, you just had your door closed
	- Company could have offices surrounding a central meeting area which is broken up into semiprivate work areas. If you needed extra concentration, you'd just wear headphones
#### Ergonomics
- [[Ergonomics]] is the study of work
- Negative effects of working long hours
	- severe eyestrain
	- Carpal tunnel syndrome
	- computer back
	- trigger finger
	- mouse shoulder
	- tech neck
- Helpful rules
	- Adjustable ergonomic chair + adjustable desk + don't hunch
	- Place monitor at or slightly below eye level
	- Position mouse at same height as keyboard and be close to the external peripherals
	- Can use anti-glare shield for screen
	- Take frequent breaks + move around
	- If you start feeling symptoms of physical problems, seek help since injuries can require surgery or extensive rehab
#### Work-Life Balance
- Companies can provide benefits like healthcare, profit sharing, conference travel budgets unlimited vacation, and season passes to local attractions
- “I’ve heard of companies that offer on-site childcare, foot massages, ping-pong tables, and gourmet cafeteria food.” ([Stephens, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=81&annotation=DTJEQQCU))
- “Some of the larger software juggernauts provide similar benefits in a grandiose attempt to duplicate the atmosphere of a university campus.” ([Stephens, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=81&annotation=NXDG6ZRU))
- Examples
	- “Apple Park in Cupertino, California,” ([Stephens, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=81&annotation=VFVQAFVX))
		- fitness center, walking and running trails, store
	- “Salesforce Tower in San Francisco” ([Stephens, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=81&annotation=CZH4IQX3))
		- social lounges

		- half-mile walk with gardens, cafes, gathering spaces, work cabanas
	- “Microsoft’s complex in Redmond, Washington,” ([Stephens, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=81&annotation=GE28YGKG))
	- “Google’s Googleplex in Mountain View, California” ([Stephens, p. 45](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=81&annotation=8TRVDZCT))
- “working 80-hour weeks isn’t sustainable, even if a few of those hours are spent in a meditation room.” ([Stephens, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=82&annotation=NV5S5I3F))
- “Spending time with the team to build a good work culture is important, but it’s also important to visit friends and relatives.” ([Stephens, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=82&annotation=WBDXV8DL))
### Collaboration Software
- “it will still be convenient (and cheaper) to do at least some work and have at least some meetings remotely.” ([Stephens, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=82&annotation=FVTGN4GR))
- Some abilities
	- “email integration, telephony support, web conferencing, file sharing, project management, faxing, and more.” ([Stephens, p. 46](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=82&annotation=89ZCSUWQ))
- Two items to consider: searching and overload
#### Searching
- “If you have a five-hour weekly meeting (my friend Mark did), it’s going to be hard to search through the archives to find exactly who suggested that everyone should wear propeller beanies to build team spirit.” ([Stephens, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=83&annotation=HAE2358I))
- “Some, like Zoom, may allow you to create captions for saved video, so you could create a transcript that way, but it’ll probably take a few extra steps.” ([Stephens, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=83&annotation=S9HIHI98)
- Assign scribe to save in email archive or some other location for later searching
#### Overload
- “avoid overloading the team members with a huge library of tools, no matter how dazzling they are.” ([Stephens, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=83&annotation=MSTWL6SN))
- “<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">It seems like everyone has their favorite application that they are convinced is the communication and management holy grail.</mark>” ([Stephens, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=83&annotation=T4P9KR6U))
- “If you throw too may tools or too much information at people, they will either ignore most of it or waste a huge amount of time trying to keep track of everything.” ([Stephens, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=83&annotation=473CZDCW))
#### Outsourcing
- “Some of the issues that can cause problems when outsourcing include things like working across multiple time zones, language and cultural differences, decreased security, and different tax and legal systems.” ([Stephens, p. 47](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=83&annotation=YDYA2C26))
	- Difficult problems revolve around team concepts
- Harder to develop common culture, communicate, stay pointed in same direction
- “The “add or remove developers as needed” strategy rarely works well in practice because it takes a relatively long time to bring new people up to speed.” ([Stephens, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=84&annotation=SZYL37FF))
- Worse time estimates
- “It’s also harder for the project manager to keep control of the remote pieces.” ([Stephens, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=84&annotation=S82XHFF9))
	- “They hadn’t really been on track the whole time, but the main project manager only knew what the outsourcing agency told us.” ([Stephens, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=84&annotation=EHRIIQPU))
- When it works
	- “The main development team (in the United States) would make changes during their workday and then send their changes to a test team in India. The test team would do their best to break the code during their workday while the Americans slept and post the results for the American team to review in the morning.” ([Stephens, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=84&annotation=M8BAAEW9))
		- Testing fortunately wasn't on critical path
		- Video meetings were terribly late or early though
- [[Outsourcing]] works best if remote teams have very clearly defined goals and make extra effort to communicate and track progress
### Summary
- “When you’re building your team, think about desirable features such as well-defined roles, clear goals, shared accountability, and trust. Create a pleasant physical environment that uses good ergonomics. Then let people modify it to suit their needs.” ([Stephens, p. 48](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=84&annotation=JVL6HNWT))

## (4) Project Management
### Introduction
- What you will learn
	- Project management
	- [[PERT chart]], [[Critical Path Method|critical paths method]], [[Gantt chart]]
	- Improve time estimates
	- [[Risk management]]
		- Lets you respond quickly and effective to problems
- Change tracking required for historical information when writing memoirs
- Track what's happening, what should be happening, and why two don't match. This is what's important with project management
- “Management is necessary to ensure that goals are set, tracked, and eventually met.” ([Stephens, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=90&annotation=K2XEW4GV))
- “a single technical manager might also handle project management tasks.” ([Stephens, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=90&annotation=RNNRQ7EB))
- On a really small project, a single person might include manager, developer, tester and end user. (arguments/meetings are generally short)
### Executive Support
- “Lack of [[executive management support]] is often cited as one of the top reasons why software projects fail.” ([Stephens, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=90&annotation=B3QGH2LE))
- “The highest-ranking executive who supports your project is often known as an [[Executive Champion|executive sponsor]] or an executive sponsor.” ([Stephens, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=90&annotation=E5L5C2L5))
- Executive support
	- “a project can get the budget, personnel, hardware, software, office space,” ([Stephens, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=90&annotation=5FRXXXM4))
	- Allows project for realistic schedule
- “Managers with limited software development experience often don’t understand that writing quality software takes time.” ([Stephens, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=90&annotation=36YAID5J))
- Executive support
	- “allowing a project to continue when it encounters unexpected setbacks such as missed deadlines or uncooperative software tools.” ([Stephens, p. 54](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=90&annotation=CS9WEMFX))
		- unexpected setbacks are so common you should expect them to occur
		- “[[Donald Rumsfeld]] would probably consider them “known unknowns.”” ([Stephens, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=91&annotation=7MVK9F2F))
- “Overall, the executive champion provides the gravitas needed for the project to survive in the rough-and-tumble world of corporate politics” ([Stephens, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=91&annotation=JVZNRHCM))
	- “can head off attempts to cancel a project and transfer its resources to some other part of the company.” ([Stephens, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=91&annotation=CBW8DXKX))
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Executive champion duties</mark>
	- Resources: budgets, hardware, personnel
	- "go/no-go" decisions and canceling projects
	- Guidance on high-level issues such as how the project fits into the company's overall business strategy
	- Navigates administrative hurdles
	- Defining the [[business case]]
	- Works with analysts, users, stakeholders (to get buy-in)
	- High-level feedback to developers about implemented features
	- Buffering project from external distractions
	- “Refereeing between managers, analysts, users, developers, and others interested in the project” ([Stephens, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=91&annotation=LSR8T9LC))
	- “Supporting the project team” ([Stephens, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=91&annotation=H8SF48U3))
	- “Staying out of the way” ([Stephens, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=91&annotation=ALRLBL5D))
- “studies have shown that more engaged executives result in more successful projects,” ([Stephens, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=91&annotation=U9793ESN))
	- “Most executives are too busy to micromanage each of the projects they control, but this can sometimes be an issue, particularly if the executive champion is near the bottom of the corporate ladder.” ([Stephens, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=91&annotation=QA5ZPLZB))
### Project Management
- “A [[project manager]] is often the highest-ranking member of the project team.” ([Stephens, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=92&annotation=LVPZ2JIH))
	- “person works with the team through all stages of development,” ([Stephens, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=92&annotation=PR2HEFG9))
		- “continuing until [[Application Rollout|application rollout]] (and sometimes even beyond into future versions).” ([Stephens, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=92&annotation=IV4EM438))
	- “monitors the project’s progress” ([Stephens, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=92&annotation=VN949YAP))
	- “meets with customers and other stakeholders to verify that the finished product meets their requirements.” ([Stephens, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=92&annotation=BLXT62ZD))
	- “If the [[Development Model|development model]] allows changes, the project manager ensures that changes are made and tracked in an organized manner so that they don’t get lost and don’t overwhelm the rest of the team.” ([Stephens, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=92&annotation=A2K4XN5N))
	- “doesn’t necessarily need to be an expert in the users’ field or in programming.” ([Stephens, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=92&annotation=QWTR7ZWY))
		- “project manager is often the main interface between the customers and the rest of the project team.” ([Stephens, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=92&annotation=46SSYUEF))
			- So it would be useful if they had both those skills
- [[Project manager]] duties:
	- Helping define the project requirements
	- Tracking project tasks
	- Anticipating and responding to problems
	- Managing risk
	- Keeping users (and the executive champion) up-to-date on the project's progress
	- Providing an interface between customers and developers
	- Managing resources such as time, people, budget , hardware, software tools, and office space
	- Managing delivery
- “Construction, architecture, engineering, and other fields have project managers.” ([Stephens, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=92&annotation=6DL6FVFW))
- “In practice, some project managers are promoted from the developer ranks, so they often have good development skills but weak project management skills.” ([Stephens, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=92&annotation=V8YS5E44))
	- Can provide technical leadership but not scheduling
- “If something started to slip, she immediately jumped all over the issue, figured out how much delay was required, asked about contingencies in case the task couldn’t be finished,” ([Stephens, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=93&annotation=KVA6679J))
	- “some larger projects divide the project manager’s duties among two or more people.” ([Stephens, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=93&annotation=EN3LEN8J))
		- Helpful for one to be technical and the other to be non-technical
		- One could be called the "technical project manager"
- “The next three sections describe [[PERT chart|PERT charts]], the [[Critical Path Method|critical path method]] (CPM), and Gantt charts. PERT charts and CPM are generally used together but are separated here so that you can digest them in smaller pieces.” ([Stephens, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=93&annotation=YFP8U5FL))
	- “these three tools can help you study the project’s total duration, look for potential bottlenecks, and schedule the project’s tasks.” ([Stephens, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=93&annotation=E53PX46Z))
#### PERT Charts
- “a graph that uses nodes (circles or boxes) and links (arrows) to show the precedence relationships among the tasks in a project.” ([Stephens, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=93&annotation=45Q44BCI))
- “[[PERT chart|PERT charts]] were invented in the 1950s by the United States Navy.” ([Stephens, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=93&annotation=5FFPPV2B))
- “They come in two flavors: [[Activity on Arrow|activity on arrow]] (AOA), where arrows represent tasks and nodes represent milestones, and [[Activity on Node|activity on node]] (AON), where nodes represent tasks and arrows represent precedence relations.” ([Stephens, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=93&annotation=MNBFCPTE)) ^e13eti
	- “Activity on node diagrams are usually easier to build and interpret” ([Stephens, p. 57](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=93&annotation=QG3WAS95))
- “To build an [[AON PERT chart]], start by listing the tasks that must be performed, the tasks they must follow (their predecessors), and the time you expect each task to take.” ([Stephens, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=94&annotation=L3CDVKSA))
	- “can also add best-case and worst-case times to each task” ([Stephens, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=94&annotation=QGUD7INN))
	- “If you like, you can add a Start task as a predecessor for any other tasks that don’t have predecessors. Similarly, you can add a Finish task for any other tasks that don’t have successors.” ([Stephens, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=94&annotation=Q5HTTN8F))
	- Tools
		- index cards or sticky notes for each task (include task name, predecessors, expected time)
	- “Then to build the chart, follow these steps:” ([Stephens, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=94&annotation=SAPPVCEQ))
		- (1) Place start task in ready pile and others in pending pile
		- (2) “Position the tasks in the Ready pile in a column to the right of any previously positioned tasks” ([Stephens, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=94&annotation=68NQZB5L))
		- (3) “Look through the tasks in the Pending pile and cross out the predecessors that you just positioned.” ([Stephens, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=94&annotation=K6DZP6IK))
		- (4) Repeat steps 2 and 3 until Finish task positioned
	- You have a predecessor loop when “task A is task B’s predecessor and task B is task A’s predecessor.” ([Stephens, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=94&annotation=425URM56))
- “After you finish positioning all of the cards, draw arrows representing the predecessor relationships.” ([Stephens, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=94&annotation=87QIUYNC))
	- “At this point, you have a chart showing the possible paths of execution for the tasks in the project.” ([Stephens, p. 58](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=94&annotation=EIIHP4KA))
- “The U.S. Strategic Command actually developed a plan for fighting off a zombie apocalypse as part of a training exercise” ([Stephens, p. 59](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=95&annotation=TZMXZZLA))
- “To check your work, you can verify that each task has one arrow entering it for each of its predecessors. For example, task G has two predecessors, so it should have two arrows entering it.” ([Stephens, p. 60](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=96&annotation=SBMFEA84))

		- Best to create a table from it
#### Critical Path Methods
- “PERT charts are often used with the critical path method, which was also invented in the 1950s.” ([Stephens, p. 62](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=98&annotation=6QP2GPPV))
	- “lets you find critical paths through the network formed by a PERT chart.” ([Stephens, p. 62](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=98&annotation=LS4GDLQG))
- “A [[Critical Path|critical path]] is a longest possible path through the network.” ([Stephens, p. 62](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=98&annotation=JHITKUT2))
	- May be more than one path with the same longest length
- “For example, refer to the PERT network shown in Figure 4.7.” ([Stephens, p. 62](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=98&annotation=Q3DVTZ22))
	- “the path Start ➪ F ➪ I ➪ G ➪ Finish has a total time of 0 + 4 + 2 + 2 + 0 = 8 days.” ([Stephens, p. 62](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=98&annotation=KLAHK5D5))
	- “Start ➪ A ➪ B ➪ C ➪ D ➪ Finish with a total length of 0 + 5 + 5 + 3 + 2 + 0 = 15 days. Because that’s the longest path, it is also the critical path.” ([Stephens, p. 63](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=99&annotation=RS322NUZ))
		- Found through trial and error
- “The critical path is called critical because, if any task along the path is delayed, the project’s final completion is also delayed.” ([Stephens, p. 63](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=99&annotation=H778XQSR))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-30 at 2.05.58 PM.png]]
	- Steps taken to find the critical path
- “the critical path network shows you [[Task Critical Paths|task critical paths]].” ([Stephens, p. 65](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=101&annotation=MFCX52BU))
	- “paths that are critical for some tasks but not for the project as a whole.” ([Stephens, p. 65](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=101&annotation=QHRX3DFZ))
		- “On a larger project, a delay on one task might ripple through the network and cause delays in many later tasks.” ([Stephens, p. 65](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=101&annotation=4TC253GZ))
		- If there is a delay in task "I", you know there will be a delay for task "G"" so you may account for that
- We see we have flexibility with tasks F and H
#### Gantt Charts
- “A [[Gantt chart]] is a kind of bar chart invented by Henry Gantt in the 1910s to show a schedule for a collection of related tasks.” ([Stephens, p. 65](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=101&annotation=2YFCG7LZ))
	- “A Gantt chart uses horizontal bars to represent task activities with the bars’ lengths indicating the tasks’ durations.” ([Stephens, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=102&annotation=BEUBC3RG))
	- “bars are placed horizontally on a calendar to show task start and stop times.” ([Stephens, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=102&annotation=JHMZR96H))
	- “Arrows show the relationships between tasks and their predecessors much as they do in a PERT chart.” ([Stephens, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=102&annotation=6F4NND47))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-30 at 2.19.29 PM.png]]
	- A Gantt chart shows task durations, start times, end times, and dependencies
	- “Also notice that the weekends have extended the project’s total duration from 15 working days to 19 calendar days.” ([Stephens, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=102&annotation=Q72GELAU))
- “To build a Gantt chart, list the tasks, their durations, and their predecessors on the left, as shown in Figure 4.11.” ([Stephens, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=102&annotation=HH9KW8IE))
- “A Gantt chart has a couple of advantages over a PERT chart. Instead of displaying tasks in somewhat arbitrary columns, it graphically shows each task’s start and end time.” ([Stephens, p. 66](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=102&annotation=7MY3JWVR))
	- Tasks are aligned with a calendar so you can see which tasks span weekends and holidays
- “A Gantt chart also shows task [[Slack Time|slack time]], the time by which a task can be delayed without delaying successor tasks.” ([Stephens, p. 67](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=103&annotation=WIG9MIIZ))
#### Scheduling Software
- “\[Tools available for computer\] make building schedules relatively easy and provide lots of extra features. For example, some enable you to click and drag to connect two tasks or to change a task’s duration.” ([Stephens, p. 67](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=103&annotation=KEV5KGU4))
- Project management applications
	- [[Asana]]
	- [[ClickUp]]
	- [[Jira]]
	- [[Kintone]]
	- [[Monday.com]]
	- [[Trello]]
	- [[Wrike]]
- “If you need to manage a lot of project schedules or schedules with many tasks, you should test-drive some of these tools to find one you like.” ([Stephens, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=104&annotation=USMT8ING))
#### Predicting Times
- “If the times you assign for the tasks aren’t reasonable, then those carefully built charts are nothing more than elaborate examples of [[GIGO]] (garbage in, garbage out).” ([Stephens, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=104&annotation=N32T2AK3))
- “One reason for this difficulty is that you rarely need to do exactly the same thing on multiple projects.” ([Stephens, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=104&annotation=T9ZX4TTS))
- “Sometimes, you can take this idea even further and avoid building an entire project, either by reusing a previous project or by purchasing a [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) application.” ([Stephens, p. 68](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=104&annotation=UVNREVUS))
- “if you’ve performed the same task before means many software engineering tasks either have fairly short well-defined times or you have little notion about how long they will take.” ([Stephens, p. 69](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=105&annotation=2YYB83GG))
##### Get Experience
- “One way to improve time estimates is to make the unknown known” ([Stephens, p. 69](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=105&annotation=WBYZ3KPX))
- Find someone who has done something similar to get a time estimate
	- “particularly important for the project lead, who will give guidance to the other team members.” ([Stephens, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=106&annotation=AMW7GE79))
- “Using experienced team members is the single best way to make time estimates more reliable.” ([Stephens, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=106&annotation=H7NRYFIR))
##### Break Unknown Tasks into Simple Pieces
- “high-level and low-level designs are all about—breaking complicated tasks into simpler pieces.” ([Stephens, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=106&annotation=DJBJIPYQ))
- Potential parts of [[inventory system]]
	- Design inventory database table to store information about inventory items
	- Build a screen to add and remove items from inventory table
	- Build interface to add and remove items from inventory as ordered and used in projects
	- Alert system when out of bees
- “You may not know exactly how much time you’ll need for each of these subtasks, but you can probably make better guesses than you could for the inventory subsystem as a whole.” ([Stephens, p. 70](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=106&annotation=JRQXCUX6))
##### Look for Similarities
- “Sometimes, tasks that you don’t understand are at least somewhat similar to tasks that you have performed before.” ([Stephens, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=107&annotation=AU2MH3SH))
- “run your ideas past someone with experience if you can.” ([Stephens, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=107&annotation=E4NTHKK7))
##### Expect the Unexpected
- “For example, in any large project, some team members will become ill and miss some work time.” ([Stephens, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=107&annotation=YZ7GW7L9))
	- Vacation or time off for personal emergencies
- “expand each task’s time estimate by some amount.” ([Stephens, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=107&annotation=ZZQHSGVY))
	- “adding 5 percent to each task’s time allows for 2.6 weeks per year for vacation and sick leave.” ([Stephens, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=107&annotation=WWUWQBGR))
		- A drawback is that people tend to use up any extra time schedule for a task
- “Another approach is to add specific tasks to the project to represent lost time.” ([Stephens, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=107&annotation=RY7HYY6Z))
	- Helpful if team members schedule vacations in advance
- “You can also add tasks to represent sick time.” ([Stephens, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=107&annotation=HY48NFWB))
- Another form of lost time is due to scheduling problem
	- “The classic example is trying to get management approval during the holiday season.” ([Stephens, p. 71](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=107&annotation=C3JIWMJF))
- “You can avoid these kinds of problems by carefully planning for approvals, holidays, order lead times, and setup.” ([Stephens, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=108&annotation=AYA9QQL4))
	- Make them tasks and place in schedule
- “A fairly new form of lost time that has become common during the COVID-19 pandemic is supply chain delays.” ([Stephens, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=108&annotation=K6QWLE4S))
	- (1) Too little production to meet demand
	- (2) No excess capacity in supply chain (no extra ships, truck drivers, warehouse space, etc.). May cause delivery to take months/years
- “In the mid-1900s, Japanese industrial engineer [[Taiichi Ohno]] pioneered an inventory technique called [[kanban]] that allowed Toyota to reorder parts only when they were needed.” ([Stephens, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=108&annotation=QU3N2B79))
- “The kanban system formed the basis of modern [[lean manufacturing]], which is also called just-in-time manufacturing or JIT.” ([Stephens, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=108&annotation=SQW3X34P))
	- ““JIT” has also been applied to [[JIT Compiler|JIT compilers]], which compile code just before it is executed. When used alone, “[[lean manufacturing|JIT]]” usually refers to the inventory and manufacturing process.)” ([Stephens, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=108&annotation=2PF8T929)) ^gp3rl7
- “When the chips stop flowing, good JIT principles stop the flow of all of the other parts too.” ([Stephens, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=108&annotation=D6TU6SIX))
	- “once those processes have stopped, many of them take a while to get back up and running.” ([Stephens, p. 72](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=108&annotation=YVX4BKSW))
		- Could take a few years to get back to finely tuned JIT production
- Tips
	- Get estimates on shipping times
	- Allow some slack for delays
	- for nonperishable items (keyboards), order early so your equipment is handy
##### Track Progress
- “Many developers are naturally optimistic and assume they can make up lost time, but they’re often wrong” ([Stephens, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=109&annotation=VVAZA8F6))
- “Working extra hours once in a while is okay, but developers who work extra hours too often eventually burn out.” ([Stephens, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=109&annotation=RV974J3J))
- “(Keeping a sustainable pace is one of the core principles behind [[agile development]], which is discussed in Chapter 19, “RAD.”” ([Stephens, p. 73](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=109&annotation=TB5PPJXW))
- To make estimates worse
	- yell at developers
	- draw lines in sand
	- red lines and points of no return
	- brag about how you don't miss deadlines
	- throw execuspeak at developers
- “encourage developers to give you estimates that are as truthful and accurate as possible.” ([Stephens, p. 74](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=110&annotation=G26WIDHJ))
- “The biggest mistake you can make is to ignore the problem and hope you can make up the time later.” ([Stephens, p. 74](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=110&annotation=AMIBP9VT))
- “Possibly the second biggest mistake you can make is to pile extra developers on the task and assume they can reduce the time needed to finish it.” ([Stephens, p. 74](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=110&annotation=U2HZZLYK))
#### Risk Management
- “[[Risk management]] is more proactive. Instead of responding to problems after they occur, risk management identifies possible risks, determines their potential impacts, and studies possible workarounds ahead of time.” ([Stephens, p. 74](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=110&annotation=SDTY4E7I))
- Determine following for each task
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Likelihood</mark>: Do you know more or less how to perform this task?
		- A high likelihood means that there is a high possibility for problems to occur
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Severity</mark>: Can you cancel this feature if task too difficult?
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Consequences</mark>: Will problems with this task affect other tasks?
	- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Workarounds</mark>: Other approaches to take to solve problem
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Difficulty</mark>: How hard will it be to implement workaround?
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Impact</mark>: What effects does it have on project's usability?
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Pros</mark>: Advantages?
		- <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">Cons</mark>: Disadvantages?
- “you might want to switch to the workaround and take the 3-day schedule slip rather than following the original approach with its unknown duration.” ([Stephens, p. 75](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=111&annotation=A3WFCSZS))
- Performing [[risk analysis]] when working on a feature
### Summary
- “[[Executive management]] is essential for the project to succeed” ([Stephens, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=112&annotation=5EYKP829))
- “[[Project management]] is critical for scheduling and tracking tasks” ([Stephens, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=112&annotation=BIZRTWZF))
- “If a task looks like it will be impossible or greatly delayed, you can switch to a workaround to stay on track and still produce something usable.” ([Stephens, p. 76](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=112&annotation=Q85Q93GQ))
### Exercises

- (3)
	- The second longest path is 30. The tasks in order are GONR and HJONR. Can slip up to 2 days
- (4) Creating a Gantt chart
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-07-03 at 4.45.27 PM.png]]
- (5) GanttProject uses task data to generate a Gantt chart.
	- “They may also provide other features such as automatic updates when a task misses its expected completion date and work assignment tracking” ([Stephens, p. 567](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=603&annotation=EMR33KC9))
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-07-03 at 5.07.45 PM.png]]
		- From my experience on MacBook Pro, it's pretty laggy
		- Shows that the final date (including break times for holidays and weekends) is February 19th, 2031
			- The Gantt chart actually did all the calculations for you. Just need to assign the date starting, add the holidays, write down how many days the task will last and write down the predecessors
- (6) How to handle unpredictable problems
	- “Add tasks at the end of the schedule to account for completely unexpected problems. When one of these problems does occur, insert its lost time into the schedule.” ([Stephens, p. 568](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=604&annotation=FDEPBLTN))

- Typical walkthrough of project
	- Gather requirements
	- Use requirements to guide development
	- Use requirements to verify if application is finished
- “Large projects with higher stakes typically have far more requirements that are spelled out much more formally and in great detail.” ([Stephens, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=118&annotation=P8GA23X7))
#### Clear
- “Good requirements are clear, concise, and easy to understand.” ([Stephens, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=118&annotation=FPU5L7JI))
	- “can’t be pumped full of execuspeak, florid prose, and confusing jargon.” ([Stephens, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=118&annotation=8MBW6MNP))
- “requirements cannot be vague or ill-defined.” ([Stephens, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=118&annotation=JRZ86CFG))
- “It is okay to use technical terms and abbreviations if they are defined somewhere or they are common knowledge in the project’s domain.” ([Stephens, p. 82](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=118&annotation=CZ47C5GH))
- Poor example: Improve appointment scheduling
- Good example: “Reduce appointment start windows to no more than two hours while meeting 90 percent of the scheduled appointments.” ([Stephens, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=119&annotation=ZAVJB273))
#### Unambiguous
- “As you write requirements, do your best to make them unambiguous. Read them carefully to make sure you can’t think of any way to interpret them other than the way you intend.” ([Stephens, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=119&annotation=IGGKMDHA))
- “Then run them past some other people (particularly customers, analysts, and other end-user representatives) to see if they agree with you.” ([Stephens, p. 83](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=119&annotation=4PVDT3MJ))
#### Consistent
- “A project’s requirements must be consistent with each other.” ([Stephens, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=120&annotation=XT6IQ463))
- “Each requirement must also be self-consistent” ([Stephens, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=120&annotation=ATKQFZXX))
	- Meaning possible to achieve
- “In a complex project, it’s not always obvious if a set of requirements is mutually consistent.” ([Stephens, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=120&annotation=7BV9H56R))

	- “you can trade development speed, development quality, and cost, but you can’t win in all three dimensions.” ([Stephens, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=120&annotation=TQMBMUIS))
#### Prioritized
- “If you’ve assigned costs (usually in terms of time to implement) and priorities to the requirements, then you can defer the high-cost, low-priority requirements until a later release.” ([Stephens, p. 84](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=120&annotation=CH4L7EA4))

	- “M—Must. These are required features that must be included.” ([Stephens, p. 85](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=121&annotation=7ZIWHJHJ))
	- “S—Should. These are important features that should be included if possible.” ([Stephens, p. 85](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=121&annotation=JHH7CHNP))
		- Can be deferred to second release
	- “C—Could. These are desirable features that can be omitted if they won’t fit in the schedule.” ([Stephens, p. 85](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=121&annotation=L7VUAEVS))
	- “W—Won’t. These are completely optional features that the customers have agreed will not be included in the current release.” ([Stephens, p. 85](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=121&annotation=Y4H78B5G))
- “For an example of using the MOSCOW method, consider a fictional drawing program named ClassyDraw.” ([Stephens, p. 85](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=121&annotation=KCMMBVJS))
	- Requirements could include: “Draw: line segments, sequences of line segments, [[splines]], polygons, ellipses, circles, rectangles, rounded rectangles, stars, images, and other shapes.” ([Stephens, p. 86](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=122&annotation=DCIB3NGI))
	- “Cut, copy, and paste the entire drawing, a rectangular selection, or an irregular selection as a [[bitmapped image]].” ([Stephens, p. 86](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=122&annotation=WFBXPK97))
- “Auto-saving (20, 21) is also a nice touch, but probably unnecessary.” ([Stephens, p. 88](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=124&annotation=K78EYSRY))
	- I'm surprised this is put in the "won't" category. It would be bad to lose all the progress.
#### Verifiable
- “Requirements must be verifiable.” ([Stephens, p. 88](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=124&annotation=ZE6ZVIK5))

#### Words to Avoid
- “Some words are ambiguous or subjective, and adding them to a requirement can make the whole thing fuzzy and imprecise.” ([Stephens, p. 89](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=125&annotation=QBZFZGWB))
	- Comparatives: faster, better, more
		- Needs to be quantified
	- Imprecise Adjectives: fast, robust, user-friendly
		- Too imprecise
	- Vague commands: minimize, maximize, improve
		- “Unless you use these in a technical algorithmic sense (for example, if you optimize flow through a network)” ([Stephens, p. 89](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=125&annotation=9B5HFNX5))
		- “Even in an algorithmic sense, these sorts of words are often applied to hard problems where exact solutions may not be possible.” ([Stephens, p. 89](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=125&annotation=KX8FFXHA))
		- Provide some numbers or other criteria to determine if requirement is met

- Examples
	- If creating a new invoice-tracking system to replace an existing system, will need to copy any pending invoices from old database into the new one
	- Could hire a bunch of teenagers on summer break to retype old invoices into the new system
	- “Other implementation requirements include hiring new staff, buying new hardware, preparing training materials, and actually training the users to use the new system.” ([Stephens, p. 92](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=128&annotation=GFWEBC2Z))

		- If you build your program as a browser app instead, you can just tell users to install a newer browser
#### FURPS+
- FURPS was extended into FURPS+ to add a few requirements categories that software engineers thought were missing
	- FURPSDIPP too hard to pronounce?
- New Categories
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Design constraints</mark>
		- “These are constraints on the design that are driven by other factors such as the [[hardware platform]], [[software platform]], [[network characteristics]], or [[database]]” ([Stephens, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=129&annotation=N4E6QKBP))
		- Might want a shadowed or mirrored database for a backup system
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Implementation requirements</mark>
		- “constraints on the way the software is built.” ([Stephens, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=129&annotation=K5NBVE57))
		- “you might require developers to meet the [[Capability Maturity Model Integration]] (CMMI) or [[ISO 9001 standards]].” ([Stephens, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=129&annotation=M6M2BIUA))
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Interface requirements</mark>
		- “constraints on the system’s interfaces with other systems” ([Stephens, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=129&annotation=PE3D8U76))
		- “tell what other systems will exchange data with the one you’re building.” ([Stephens, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=129&annotation=SVJQ7WX2))
			- Kinds of interactions taking place
			- What will occur
			- Format of data exchanged
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Physical requirements</mark>
		- “constraints on the hardware and physical devices that the system will use.” ([Stephens, p. 93](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=129&annotation=I7UMDB68))
			- May require a minimum amount of processing power
			- Maximum amount of electrical power
			- Easy portability (tablet/smartphone)
			- Toch screens

	- Mirroring a database off-sites takes a whole new meaning
		- Database is in cloud
		- Cloud provider normally shuffles databases back and forth across servers as needed
			- Might need to guarantee that data never leaves home country for legal reasons
##### FURPS+ CHECKLIST
- ![[Screenshot 2023-07-03 at 6.30.59 PM.png|400]]
	- “Although the initial requirements all seem reasonable, they’re all functionality requirements. They tell what the application should do but don’t give much information about usability, reliability, performance, and other requirements that should belong to the other FURPS+ categories.” ([Stephens, p. 94](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=130&annotation=Q4PXVFPQ))
	- “You might think that a requirements list containing only functionality requirements would be an unusual situation. However, left to their own devices, many programmers come up with exactly this sort of list.” ([Stephens, p. 94](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=130&annotation=7ELKJ4FF))

	- “You should at least think about every category and either (1) come up with some new requirements that belong there or (2) write down why you don’t think you need any requirements for that category.” ([Stephens, p. 95](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=131&annotation=XNQGAVXQ))
- FURPS+ requirements categories
	- Functionality: What program should do 
		- Initial list of requirements covers category
	- Usability: What program should look like
		- Add requirements indicating how user navigates from ordering to picking sandwich/ingredients
		- Provide details about login (customer accounts?)
		- Specify each form will display Loxsmith logo
	- Reliability: How reliable system should be
		- Only available while Loxsmith open?
		- Could customers preorder?
	- Performance: How efficient system should be
		- How quickly should application respond to customers?

#### Common Requirements
- Specific requirements that may arise in applications
	- Screens
		- Screens/forms needed
	- [[Menus]]

### Gathering Requirements
- “you know what makes a good requirement (clear, unambiguous, consistent, prioritized, and verifiable).” ([Stephens, p. 96](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=132&annotation=U4D55D69))
- “following sections describe several techniques you can use to gather and refine requirements.” ([Stephens, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=133&annotation=E9NDVTPV))
#### Listen to Customers (and Users)
- “Initially, focus as much as possible on the problem, not on the customers’ suggested solutions, so you can keep the requirements flexible.” ([Stephens, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=133&annotation=6ULTKLYN))
- “sometimes the customers have a good reason that you just don’t understand” ([Stephens, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=133&annotation=8C3ASBVF))
- “Penalizing routes that contain left turns (and U-turns) will save the company money.” ([Stephens, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=133&annotation=NQKU36F9))
	- Good information for trucker routes
- “Take lots of notes while you’re listening to the customers.” ([Stephens, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=133&annotation=3K92YWKW))
- “If a customer requirement seems odd, dig a bit deeper to find out what, if anything, is behind the request.” ([Stephens, p. 97](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=133&annotation=4XXGIB38))
#### Use the Five Ws (and One H)
- “You can help by using the five Ws (who, what, when, where, and why) and one H (how).” ([Stephens, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=134&annotation=GY8VLNJY))
	- If customer has difficulty articulating needs
##### Who
- “Find out if the users and the customers are the same.” ([Stephens, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=134&annotation=7MTBHAUU))
- Find out who uses the software
##### What
- “Figure out what the customers need the application to do.” ([Stephens, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=134&annotation=QJDBYUHR))
- “Focus on the goals as much as possible rather than the customers’ ideas about how the solution should work.” ([Stephens, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=134&annotation=ZIMZBAQA))
##### When
- “Find out when the application is needed.” ([Stephens, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=134&annotation=7Y6ZNSTX)
- “If the application will be rolled out in phases, find out which features are needed when.” ([Stephens, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=134&annotation=ULT9WF22))
	- Use Gantt charts to figure out how much time is actually needed
- “Don’t let the customers (and your management, by the way) assume they can get everything on their schedule just by “motivating you harder.”” ([Stephens, p. 98](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=134&annotation=ISYY8PM9))
##### Where
- Find out where the application will be used
##### Why
- “Ask why the customers need the application.” ([Stephens, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=135&annotation=WSJQSLCA))
	- “help clarify the customers’ needs and see if they are real.” ([Stephens, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=135&annotation=4TVKB3VE))
- Example
	- If someone wants to automate a parts ordering system but if streamlining the ordering process will cut the ordering time from 2 days to 1.5 days leaving 4-6 weeks of shipping delay, then maintaining an inventory of slow-to-order parts might be a better idea
##### How
- Find out customer's ideas towards solution
	- May reduce training time by making application mimic their approach
#### Study Users
- “Instead of making users remember what report they last had open, the program can remember.” ([Stephens, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=135&annotation=I4HM7EZF))
	- Button or menu item could fix this
- “By studying users as they work, you can learn more about what they need to do, how they currently do it, and how frequently they do it.” ([Stephens, p. 99](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=135&annotation=CC6QI5J5))
- “Watching users in their natural habitat often pays off.” ([Stephens, p. 100](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=136&annotation=2TAQ9KAL))
- “it’s relatively easy to build a printer emulation program.” ([Stephens, p. 100](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=136&annotation=G6QMDA8Z))
- “pay close attention to the customers’ comments.” ([Stephens, p. 100](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=136&annotation=P2HDP3K3))
	- Customers and your customer's customers seem to be used interchangeably 
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Key things to pay attention to</mark>
	- Pay attention to how customer does things
	- Look at forms they fill out
	- Where they spend most of their time
	- Tasks that go smoothly and those that don't
	- Use information above to identify areas in which your project can help

### Refining Requirements
- Customers and users can be separate terms
- “You need to distill the goals (what the customers need to do) into approaches (how the application will do it).” ([Stephens, p. 100](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=136&annotation=3JZCBWTW))
- “At a high level, the requirement “Process customer records” is fine.” ([Stephens, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=137&annotation=35BD2IVG))
	- “requirements describing the forms, navigation techniques, and other features that the application must provide to let the users do their jobs.” ([Stephens, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=137&annotation=EWV5GSRQ))
- “Moving from goals to requirements often forces you to make some design decisions.” ([Stephens, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=137&annotation=HG7QLY6K))
	- Specify form layouts and how work flows through the system
		- part of [[requirements gathering]]
- Approaches for [[converting goals into requirements]]
#### Copy Existing Systems
- Advantages
	- “you can often use many of the behaviors of the existing system as requirements for the new one.” ([Stephens, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=137&annotation=4AS79AYB))
	- “dig through an existing application and write down what it does.” ([Stephens, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=137&annotation=KERE2PZG))
	- “If an existing system does something, then you at least know it’s possible.” ([Stephens, p. 101](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=137&annotation=JFZ7BL4Q))
- Disadvantages
	- Changes not part of original system are not guaranteed to be possible
	- Incompatible with original system
	- [[Users]] often reluctant
	- Example
		- An application with many interfaces to a number of external databases and automated systems can result in hundreds of hours of work to be converted to thousands of hours of work
		- This is why [[requirements gathering]] is so important to help prevent this

#### Clairvoyance
- Best practice: Experienced [[project leads]]
	- “A project’s chances for success are greatly improved if the project lead has previous experience with the same kind of project.” ([Stephens, p. 103](zotero://select/library/items/5IBTFC2Q)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/WUIGJ52N?page=139&annotation=Z7HJ5YV2))
- Why experience is important
	- [[programmer|Programmers]]
		- Encounter fewer problems + meet scheduled milestones more often
	- [[Documenters]]
		- Writing user manuals easier
	- [[Project Manager|Project managers]]
		- Know what tasks are difficult
	- [[Design specialist]]
		- [[user interface designer]]
		- [[human factors experts]]
