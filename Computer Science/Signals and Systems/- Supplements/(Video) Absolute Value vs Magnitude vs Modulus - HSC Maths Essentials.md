- $|a| = ?$
	- Absolute value?
	- Magnitude of a vector?
	- Modulus of complex numbers?
- The 2 strokes depends on if it represents numbers, vectors or complex numbers
- Representing Numbers
	- |a|
		- Absolute value of a
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-21 at 10.19.35 PM.png]]
				- A number on the number line. And the distance to the origin. The distance would be a.
				- Therefore, the absolute value of a is = a
				- This is when a is a positive number
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-21 at 10.19.49 PM.png]]
				- Value of a is negative but the result will be a positive number since $-a =2$ .
				- Only true when a is less than 0
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-21 at 10.20.52 PM.png]]
				- The distance to the origin from the origin is 0.

		- magnitude of our vector a ($\vec{a}$)
			-  A vector can be represented with a tilde underneath the variable ($\underset{\sim}a$)
		- We are finding the magnitude (the distance for the vector to the origin)
		- $\vec{a}$ = $x\vec{i} + y\vec{j}$ 4
		- $|\overrightarrow{OA}|$ =  $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ 
			- Distance of vector of $\vec{A}$ 
			- Magnitude is equal to $\sqrt{x^2+y^2}$ 
			- The point A(x,y) tells us how far away from the origin
		- For 3D
			- a = 3$\vec{i}$ + 4$\vec{j}$ + 12$\vec{k}$
			- $|\vec{a}| = \sqrt{3^2 + 4^2 + 12^2} = 13$
- Representing Complex Numbers

		- $|z|$ 
			- z is usually used to represent complex numbers
			- We call this modulus of $z$
		- $z$ = x + iy
		- Y axis is imaginary numbers and y axis is real numbers
		- modulus of z is the distance from the origin to the complex number z(x,y)
		- Equation
			- $|z| = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}$
