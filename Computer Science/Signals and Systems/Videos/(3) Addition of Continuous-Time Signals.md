- We add the amplitudes of 2 or more signals at each instant of time to get their sum

- 1st signal -> $x_1(t)$ 
- 2nd signal -> $x_2(t)$ 
- Resulting signal: $x_3(t) = x_1(t) + x_2(t)$ 
	- We have to add the amplitudes of the first 2 signals at each instant of time to find the resulting signal

		- Just need to do 0 + 2 = 2
- We can also observe that signal $x_1 (t)$ is 0 when $1 < t \le  2$
	- Instead of writing t=2, we can write the above to get the answer below
