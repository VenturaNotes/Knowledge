- We multiply amplitudes of 2 or more signals at each instant of time to get their product
- $x_3(t) = x_1(t) \times x_2(t)$ 
	- To find $x_3(t)$ we need to multiply the amplitude of $x_1(t)$ by the amplitude of $x_2(t)$ at each instant of time
- Whenever one signal is equal to 0, the resulting signal will always be 0
