	- [[Computational Complexity]]
		- Can I solve this problem with a computer?
		- What kind of computer would I need?
		- What computational resources do I need?
			- Time
			- Memory
			- Access to random numbers
				- Might be able to do things you'd otherwise be unable to do
			- Communication
				- Potentially between 2 or more computers
		- We would like to classify, to group together, problems according to the amount of resources that are roughly required to obtain a solution
			- Problems needing a lot of time
			- Problems needing very little time
		- Can help to see sooner that we cannot solve a task with the available resources
		- Can help to see how to transfer solutions from one task to a new task
