- Course Outline
	- [[Computability Theory]] 1930s - 1950s
		- What is computable... or not?
		- What is computable with an algorithm in principal?
		- Examples
			- [[Program Verification]] (you cannot make a verifier which is going to answer in all cases whether or not a program meets a certain specification)
			- [[Mathematical Truth]] (no algorithm that can answer that question) 
		- [[Models of computation]]:
			- [[Finite automata]], [[Turing Machines]]
	- [[Complexity Theory]] 1960s - Present
		- What is computable in practice?
		- Example
			- [[Factoring problem]]
				- [[RSA]] ([[cryptosystem]])
				- Asks if you can factor big numbers quickly
				- We don't know how to factor big numbers quickly but it may be possible that there are algorithms to do so.
		- [[P versus NP problem]]
		- [[Measure of complexity]]: Time and space
			- Theorists call space "memory"
		- Models: Probabilistic and interactive computation

- Course Expectations
	- Prerequisites
		- Prior substantial experience and comfort with mathematical concepts, theorems, and proofs. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Creativity will be needed for psets and exams</mark>

- Role of Theory in Computer Science
	- (1) Applications
	- (2) Basic Research
	- (3) Connections to other fields
	- (4) What is the nature of computation?
		- Methods we have so far don't allow us to understand creativity
		- Not close to creating a computer program that can do mathematics
		- Machine Learning is only successful for a narrow set of tasks
		- There is probably something more deeper and fundamental going on
		- We have a primitive understanding of computation at this stage

- Let's begin: [[Finite Automata]]
	- Represents computer with a very small and limited amount of memory
	- Presenting Finite automata as a [[state diagram]]
		- Has circles, lines, and labels
	- Name of the finite automata is "M1"
	- [[States]]
		- Circles  - $q_1, q_2, q_3$
			- $q_1 \text{ and } q_2$ are not accepting states
	- [[Transitions]]
		- Arrows connecting states with each other
	- [[Start state]]
		- Has an arrow coming in from nowhere
	- [[Accept States]]
		- Has to do with how a machine computes
		- Has double circles
	- [[Input]]: finite string (of 0s and 1s. May be allowed to have other kinds of symbols)
	- [[Output]]: Accept or reject
	- [[Computation process]]: Begin at start state, read input symbols, follow corresponding transitions, Accept if end with accept state, reject if not.
	- Examples (binary decision)
		- 01101 $\rightarrow$ accept
		- 00101 $\rightarrow$ Reject
	- Every state has an outgoing transition for both 1 and 0 (there is always somewhere to go each time you read the symbols from the input)
	- $M_1$ accepts exactly those strings in A where A = {w | w contains substring 11}
		- Set A of those strings that have substring 11 will be the language of $M_1$ 
	- Say that A is the [[language]] $M_1$ and that $M_1$ recognizes A and that A = $L(M_1)$. 
		- The 3 statements above are equivalent
		- We call these collection of strings the [[language]] of the machine
		- $A = L(M_1)$ is read as 
			- A is the langue of $M_1$ 
		- The language of a machine is exactly the set of strings that machine accepts
	- Types of questions
		- What are the set of strings the machine accepts?
		- Given a language, build a machine which recognizes that language  
		- Then understanding what are the class of languages
			- Can you get any language from some machine or are there some languages you can do and some languages you cannot do.
	- The machine would not accept "101" because you did not end up in an accepted state. Machine would reject it.

- Formal Definition
- Allows us to be very precise and provides notation
- May be asked to give a family of automata where there is a parameter "n", associated with the class of languages we're trying to describe with the automaton 
- Definition: A [[finite Automaton]] M is a 5-tuple (Q $\Sigma$, $\delta$, $q_0$, F)
	- A 5-tuple is just a list of 5 things
	- Q - [[finite set of states]]
	- $\Sigma$ - [[finite set of alphabet symbols]]
	- $\delta$ - [[transition function]] $\delta$: $Q \times \Sigma \rightarrow Q$
		- How the automaton moves from state to state 
		- $\delta$ is a function here
			- It takes 2 things. When you have Q cross $\Sigma$ (a state and an alphabet symbol),
