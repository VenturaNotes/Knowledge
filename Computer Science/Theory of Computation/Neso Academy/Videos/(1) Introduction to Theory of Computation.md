## Introduction
- One of the most fundamental courses of Computer Science
	- This is [[theory of computation]]
- Will help you understand how people have thought about Computer Science as a Science in the past 50 years
- It is mainly about what kind of things can you really compute mechanically, how fast and how much space does it take to do so
	- Create a machine that accepts all binary strings that end in 0
		- 11010110

	- Accepts all valid java codes
		- Binary -> Valid or invalid?

	- Accepts all valid Java codes and never goes into infinite loop
		- It is impossible to not create a machine that never goes into an infinite loop
	- Design systems and machines that takes an input and will return yes or no

## Layers
- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-02 at 6.14.57 PM.png]]
	- FSM
		- Finite State Machine
			- Simplest model of computation
			- Limited amount of memory
			- Can perform low level computations and calculations
			- Basic building block of subject
	- CFL
		- Context Free Language
			- Higher level computations
			- Language means (set of strings)
	- Turing Machine
		- High level computations and calculations
		- Designed by Alan Turing in 1940
			- Much more powerful as compared to context free languages and finite state machines
	- Undecidable
		- These are problems that cannot be solved mechanically
