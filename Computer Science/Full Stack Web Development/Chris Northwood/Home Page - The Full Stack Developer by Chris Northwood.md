## (1) The Modern Web
- “The developers working on these teams are sometimes referred to as T-shaped, because their breadth of knowledge is just as important as any depth of technical specialty they may have.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=15&annotation=PXNM8JEV)) 
	- It seems like this book is more for business people.
- “Digital teams eliminate those communication overheads by adopting ways of working and a culture known as DevOps, which blends the lines between development and operational responsibility.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=15&annotation=XMK6ZQAD))
- Quality Assurance:
	- "Goes beyond quality control functions and testing activities in order to evaluate software quality" [^1]
- “specialized generalists” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=16&annotation=AEK5QCWN)) 
	- "are those with the ability to work cross-functionally (the horizontal line in the “T”) coupled with the deep ability to speak for and work within their individual specialty (the vertical line in the “T”). [^2]
### (1.1) Rise of the Web
- “The addition of media queries to CSS allowed web page styling to target screens with specific characteristics, rather than have the page look the same on every device.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=17&annotation=38XFFCEY))
- “Responsive Web Design, in which the design of a single web page should respond to the capabilities of the device it is being rendered on.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=17&annotation=BPDAUWM4))
- “the Web has adopted better support for working offline, using features such as service workers that allow apps to continue working while disconnected.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=18&annotation=MU5XPVWR))
### (1.2) Mobile Web
- “an effective market with a mechanism for charging a fee to obtain the app, and the ability to live on the launcher for that device to gain headspace for the user.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=19&annotation=NZANY6Y4))
### (1.3) The State of HTML
- “WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) which developed it’s own variation of the HTML standard.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=20&annotation=6X9SJPVQ))
- “the W3C and WHATWG definitions of HTML5 have drifted.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=20&annotation=SVFYG4BH))
- “there are many JavaScript libraries, known as “polyfills,” that exist to provide a pure JavaScript version of any new features of the JavaScript language” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=20&annotation=WQCQPUHE))
- “progressive enhancement approach” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=21&annotation=3NZ6IR4P)) 
	- a design philosophy that provides a baseline of essential content and functionality to as many users as possible, while delivering the best possible experience only to users of the most modern browsers that can run all the required code. [^3]
- “Browsers also indicate a non-standard feature with a “vendor prefix,” where the JavaScript API or CSS attribute is prefixed with the name of the browser maker to indicate that it is a browser-specific feature” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=20&annotation=SLT4FTDL)) 
	- I actually used this when working with graphics for my High School website
- “The Mozilla Developer Network is a fantastically thorough resource, and the brilliant website caniuse.com will tell you how well supported a particular feature is” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=21&annotation=Q6H8JAYN)) 
	- It shows you if a feature works on most popular browsers
- “Targeting a known runtime can make your life easier” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=21&annotation=7W7CGD9C))
- “Progressive enhancement is a technique where you deliver a basic version of some functionality to a device, and then test if the device can support a more advanced alternative, then enable the enhanced alternative if the test is successful.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=21&annotation=S2VLM34G))
### (1.4) Applications vs. Web Sites
- “the line between what once would have been called a “web site” and what is now called a “web app” has blurred.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=21&annotation=36YFE7TA))
- “Web sites were generally content-based sites” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=21&annotation=G4M35T78))
- “a catalogue a user browses works best as a site, but inventory management tools work best as an application.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=22&annotation=DCT2ET54))
- “Web app toolkits and frameworks may appear powerful, but often break an important fundamental of the Web - that the Web is made up of a series of linked pages.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=22&annotation=G98EQWGC))
- “avoiding web app toolkits will allow you to benefit from many fundamental features of the Web (such as shareable URLs, as well as caching and archiving).” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=22&annotation=NDNTD3DX))
### (1.5) Keeping Up
- “Keeping things small can make adopting these new techniques easier, as you can iterate quickly on a change to see if it works out, and potentially even decide against a change without having committed too much—this is known as [[failing fast]].” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 8-9](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=22&annotation=CHS8H2QE))
	- These concepts are discussed in-depth in the Designing Systems Chapter
- “you need to invest your own time into your career too, and this “continuing professional development” is an important part of that.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=23&annotation=D9GUFP4J))
### (1.6) Summary
- “The full stack developer must therefore be a specializing generalist who can take on a number of different tasks, and work with skills from other disciplines.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=23&annotation=2W797QXM))
- “It’s important to understand the history of the Web to allow you to pick the right tools for complex and rich applications known as web apps, which may not be the same for content-driven web sites, which follow different interaction patterns.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=23&annotation=ACV7QI2N))

## (2) Planning Your Work
- “A competing concern with the planning process is that it is often also used to develop estimates and communicate to external stakeholders how well the team is performing.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=24&annotation=2MU49XKY)) A pitfall to avoid
	- One of the pitfalls to watch out for.
- “In a traditional organization, developers live in their own team, and so don’t necessarily have the domain knowledge around the area of the business that they’re developing software for.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=24&annotation=MBYZSR8S))
- “The agile movement has had one of the biggest effects on the growth of digital businesses and the changing structure of development teams” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=25&annotation=V4J388UP))
- “The process described above is often called the “waterfall” model, characterized as the opposite of agile.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=25&annotation=WI5CRK3X))
- “And even the best agile teams will have some sort of mini-waterfall, although a mini-waterfall can feed into itself;” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=25&annotation=XL2C7LY6))
- “Through this work we have come to value: • Individuals and interactions over processes and tools • Working software over comprehensive documentation • Customer collaboration over contract negotiation • Responding to change over following a plan” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=25&annotation=QK44UBR8))
- The Agile Manifesto ([Northwood, 2018, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=25&annotation=RJFPMIEF))
	- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
	- Working software over comprehensive documentation
	- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
	- Responding to change over following a plan
- “Documentation can help with communication, so use that, but don’t document every part of what you’re building before you build it.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=26&annotation=3BBMZLNR))
- “With a lighter process with a lower overhead, each change can be smaller, which minimizes the time between defining a project and it actually getting done.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=26&annotation=XXCEVBZK))
- “Work in progress should be scoped to be small, so the impact of such a change is not huge.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=26&annotation=BPLHEW33))
- “the organization may want long-term stability and visibility of their IT systems that agile simply can’t provide; the very nature of being quick to respond to change means you can’t pin down a six-month roadmap, unless you agree not to change it, which is no longer agile.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=26&annotation=6RMKL8KI))
### (2.1) Identify Requirements
- “Many teams, especially larger teams, designate an individual who is largely responsible for this. This is sometimes called a business analyst,” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 13](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=27&annotation=G2WGFLT6))
- “Workshops involve getting a bunch of people together and running activities, with the hope of getting some useful information out of them.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=28&annotation=YXA4MU9Z))
- “The people from outside your team who attend a workshop are often referred to as stakeholders; these are the people who have an interest in what you’re building.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=28&annotation=D3NCSXXW))
- “Workshops in the [[discovery phase]] might involve a large group of stakeholders, getting everyone together in a room to define the problem that needs solving.” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=28&annotation=ZH9FUVK3))
- The [[double-diamond model]]
	- “shows how to diverge to generate breadth of ideas, and then converge to generate depth on both the problem and the solution” ([Northwood, 2018, p. 15](zotero://select/library/items/IRY769L4)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RQKPRJ88?page=29&annotation=IK3ESFXX))
