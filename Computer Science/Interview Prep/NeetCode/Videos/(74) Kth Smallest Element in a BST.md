## Source [^1]
- Given the `root` of a binary search tree, and an integer `k`, return the $k^{th}$ (1-indexed) smallest element in the tree.
- A [[binary search tree]] by definition means that it's in order.
- Writing an inorder traversal for a binary search tree recursively is pretty easy
	- We will be shown how to do it iteratively though
