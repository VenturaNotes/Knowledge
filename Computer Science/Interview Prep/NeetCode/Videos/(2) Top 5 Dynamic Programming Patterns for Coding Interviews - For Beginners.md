	- Fibonacci Numbers Pattern
		- F(0) = 0
			- The 0th fibonacci number is 0
		- F(1) = 1
		- For every fibonacci number that coming after it, it's going to be the summation of previous 2 fibonacci numbers
		- Why is it a [[dynamic programming]] problem?
		- Na√Øve way to compute F(6) would be with a [[decision tree]]
			- Will keep going down the tree until we get the base cases of $F(0) = 0$ and $F(1) = 1$
			- We see though that there is some repeated work going on such as $F(4)$ which is why we can apply dynamic programming
				- Would not need to compute $F(4)$ again on the right tree
	- [[bottom-up approach to dynamic programming]]
		- Fibonacci numbers pattern is a 1-dimensional dynamic programming problem
		- Climbing stairs similar (array of n size)
		- Start from $F(0)$ 
		- Don't need to keep storing $F(0)$ and $F(1)$ in memory

	- Zero / One Knapsack pattern
		- One of the problems is the "partition equal subset sum"
		- We want to use coins to sum a particular target
			- Using coins, is it ever possible to sum up to target?
			- We can use each of the coins only 0 times or 1 time
				- How many possible combinations can we have with the coins?
					- n = size of input array
					- Number of ways we could do it is $2^n$ 
		- Initial target is 5. How can we get a sub-problem. Dynamic programming is all about getting sub-problems
		- Brute force decision tree
			- Target can be anywhere from 5 to 0
				- This is one-dimension of our problem, of our [[cache]], our dynamic programming grid
			- Size of target is one dimension
		- More complex than fibonacci numbers problem

	- [[Unbounded Knapsack]]
		- 2D dynamic programming problem
		- For coins = $[1, 2, 3]$, 1 could be chosen 5 times.

	- [[Longest common subsequence]]
		- "abc" subsequence of this string is basically a non-contiguous element of the orderings
			- We can choose to include a character or not include a character
			- "ac" needs to be in this order since this is the order of the characters in the original
		- Longest common subsequence between empty strings is just an empty string itself. Returns 0
		- The X's can be replaced by 0's. (LCS between empty and non-empty strings is 0)
		- Top-left corner is usually the target value we're looking for in dynamic programming grid
		- This can also be a bottom-up approach to a 2D dynamic programming problem

	- [[Palindromes]]
		- "racecar"
			- Naive way would be to check every character in the string starting at the ends and going towards the middle.
			- Smart way
				- Start at any given string of size 1 and expand outwards
				- so for "racecar"
					- We can start with "e" which itself is a palindrome [^1]
					- By expanding, we need to check the left and right character which is done in O(1) time. and we get that `cec` is a palindrome but just comparing the "c" characters
						- This works for an odd number of letters
				- For a string with an even number of letters, we need to start comparing with 2 characters at a time
					- For example in "racecar", we'd take `ce` and immediately see it's not an even number palindrome as c $\ne$ e
					- If first string is not a palindrome, none of the new strings will be palindromes either
