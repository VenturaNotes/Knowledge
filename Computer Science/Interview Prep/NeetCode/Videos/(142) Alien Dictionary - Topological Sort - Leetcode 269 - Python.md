- [[Topological sort]]
	- Involves a [[directed acyclic graph|DAG]] (a graph which has directed edges but no cycles)
- The input that we're given is already sorted
- In the first example, the order is non-ambiguous
- Could do a BFS or DFS solution for this. (DFS preferred here as BFS requires a lot more bookkeeping) 
- If there is a contradiction, we return an empty string as there would be no real solution (especially if there is a cycle in the graph)
- If we have two separate graphs such as `r -> t -> f` and `w -> e`, then we don't have a contradiction. Just multiple solutions
	- `wertf` or `rtfwe` or `wretf` could all be solutions
- [[post-order DFS]]
	- Helps solve the `A -> B -> C` problem where `A -> C` as well
	- Can build result in reverse order

- Will keep track of visit and path
	- Will use dictionary
- Time complexity will be dependent on number of characters

Space Complexity: $O(V+E)$
- Where $V$ is the number of unique characters, $E$ is the number of edges and $N$ is the sum of lengths of all the strings

            if len(w1) > len(w2) and w1[:minLen] == w2[:minLen]:
                return ""
            for j in range(minLen):

                    if w2[j] not in adj[w1[j]]:
                        adj[w1[j]].add(w2[j])
                        indegree[w2[j]] += 1
                    break
        
        q = deque([c for c in indegree if indegree[c] == 0])
        res = []
        
        while q:
            char = q.popleft()
            res.append(char)
            for neighbor in adj[char]:
                indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    q.append(neighbor)
