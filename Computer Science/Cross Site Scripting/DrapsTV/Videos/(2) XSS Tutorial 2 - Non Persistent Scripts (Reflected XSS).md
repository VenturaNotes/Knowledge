	- Non Persistent Scripts
	- Environment Setup
		- If you wish to follow along by trying out everything we learn, The 'XSS Tutorial - Setting Up The XSS Environment' video will get you ready to test in a safe & legal environment [@](https://youtu.be/-NSXCDjepis?si=qpk9XWPbPN9tl8yt)
	- What is a Non Persistent Script?
		- A Non Persistent Script is as the name describes. The attack only affect's the user running the script
			- A [[Non Persistent Script]] does not persist on the website
		- A benefit of trying a non-persistent attack is that any success with injecting a script may indicate that the website's creator may have gotten protection in another section of the site. The website's creator may have forgot to protect other input fields
		- Its's not very useful to attack yourself, so we need to be a little crafty
		- A Non persistent script can also be referred to as [[Reflected XSS]]
	- What is Reflected XSS?
		- I like to split Reflected Attacks as their own little sub field
		- Reflected XSS is harnessed by attaching the malicious script to the end of a URL/Link
		- Though it may be obvious to see code on the end of a URL, techniques of hiding it are possible
		- Also with the service of link shortening services, this can be very deadly

	- What can it do?
		- Reflected XSS is very common cross site scripting method currently
		- The malicious code possibilities are endless. But for examples sake we could
			- Redirect to a phishing
			- Steal cookie information
			- Force the user to make an action (such as clicking on a button)
	- Let's Give it a shot
		- Let's just do some basic mucking around with some HTML tags to see what we can do with this very vulnerable page
		- The PHP code file can be found in the description
		- We will try some pure HTML, then we will try the common alert('XSS') script.

	- We search "test" in the search bar and the results are not found
	- Then we try an HTML tag `<i>` for italics. When we hit search, we see that the rest of the page will show all italics
		- Could also be done with `<font color="blue">` which would make the rest of the text appear blue without a closing tag
	- `<script>alert("XSS")</script>`
		- We found a cross site scripting vulnerability in this search. We can see in the URL that query was appended to the end
			- Could send this link to somebody provided that it was on an external web host and they would get the same pop-up

	- Attack Strategies
		- You can try to trick a specific victim into clicking the link through an email or instant messaging.
		- Alternatively if you don't have a specific target, you can publish the link to a website or social media and try to trick people into clicking it
		- Once again URL shortening make this much easier. In a later video, we will talk about other ways to hide the code
