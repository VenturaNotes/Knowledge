	- What is cross-site scripting
	- What is [[Cross-Site Scripting|XSS]]?
		- Cross Site Scripting, otherwise known as XSS is a code injection attack allowing the injection of malicious code into a website
		- XSS is currently one of the most common website attacks, with almost every website requiring the user to have JavaScript turned on
			- As well as large websites and services that have large amount of input fields that could potentially be vulnerable
	- What is XSS?
		- Rather than being an attack on the website itself, it uses the website as a means to attack the users of that website.
		- When you can get your XSS permanently on a website, all those who visit that page will have the JavaScript executed by their browser
	- What can it do?
		- Malicious JavaScript can be used to do all sorts of malicious tasks
		- It can be used to steal users cookies, allowing for someone to use the website pretending to be that user
		- JavaScript can modify the page to make it look different or behave differently
		- It can even send you to another website taking data with you
			- Could have your login details phished

	- What's happening
		- Let's first look at how HTML works
		- HTML is a tag based language, so when we open a tag such as `<b>` for bold, all text after that tag becomes bold until a matching `</b>` closing tag is found
		- But what might happen if we were to only put a `<b>` tag in a search box that doesn't strip the tag?
	- What's happening. Ext
		- Let's think if I placed a bold tag in this slide `<b>` then everything in the rest of this slide would be bold until a closing bold was found
		- The scary part of XSS comes when we use the `<script>` tag, informing the browser anything between the script tags is JavaScript
			- #comment Seems like this could be used against websites that build their pages with templates without even knowing all the vulnerabilities that the template may have
		- I'm keeping this super simple as we will get into the basics next tutorial with some simple examples

			- Made a self-retweeting tweet to thousands of people in mid 2014
	- Prerequisites
		- A fairly strong understanding of JavaScript is required if you wish to easily follow along.
		- Of course without skills in JavaScript you won't possess the power to construct your own scripts
		- A fair understanding of HTML is required as well as a rough idea of how web backend works.
