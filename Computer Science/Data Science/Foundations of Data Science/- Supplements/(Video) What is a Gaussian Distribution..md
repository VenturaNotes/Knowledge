- It's the common bell-shaped curve

- This probability density function looks like the shape of a cross section of a bell
- Equation for probability density function

	- the $\mu$ (mu) is a variable and the $\sigma$ (sigma) is a variable
		- The $\mu$ is the mean of the probability density. So it's the x in $P_x$ ?

		- $\sigma$ is the standard deviation
		- $\sigma^2$ is the variance (this indicates the width of the bell)
	- $\mu$ and $\sigma$ are both parameters which changes the shape of the bell
		- changing $\mu$ moves it up and down
		- changing $\sigma$ makes it wider or narrower
