- React Version being learned is 16.5.2
- Will start from scratch and learn different concepts in react
- What is react?
	- Open source javascript library for building user interfaces
	- React is not a framework
	- Focus on UI
		- Focused on one thing and doing one thing really well
		- Does not focus on other aspects of application like routing and http requests
		- Good for building rich user interfaces
	- Rich ecosystem
		- Plays really well with other libraries
		- Capable of building full-fledged web applications
- Why learn React?
	- Created and maintained by Facebook
		- Rest assured it won't die down anytime soon (youtube video published on Oct 22, 2018)
		- More than 100k stars on Github
		- Huge Community
			- Many solutions from Stack Overflow should be found
			- If you read Stack Overflow developer survey every year, you will find out that React has become increasingly popular among developers and is one of the most sought out skillsets by companies right now
			- Great for front-end developer jobs
- Component based architecture
	- small encapsulated parts for more complex UIs
	- Traditional website
		- Broken into header, sidenav, main content, and footer
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-11-26 at 5.48.39 AM.png|500]]
		- Each section falls into a component when composed correctly make up the entire website
- Reusable code (helpful for components)
	- You can have a component for an article on react
	- Same component can be re-used for articles on angular and Vue by simple passing the right data into the article component

		- Huge plus point for enterprise applications
- React is declarative
	- Tell react what you want and React will build the actual UI
		- This is the [[declarative paradigm]]
			-  If you go to artist and draw landscape, you don't tell them how to draw them, it's up to them. Tell them what has to be done, and the artist gets it done for you
			- Abstracts away the difficult parts
		- In contrast with [[imperative paradigm]] we're usually used to
			- implements algos in explicit steps
			- Telling a 5 year old child how to draw landscape. Tell him mountains, trees and etc. Explicitly specify each step. Control the flow of landscape
	- React will handle efficiently updating and rendering of the components
		- Dom updates (more expensive operations) is handled gracefully in react
- More on why React?
	- Makes no assumptions on rest of technology stack for your project
	- Seamlessly integrate react into any of your applications
	- Portion of your page or a complete page or even an entire application itself
	- Reactive native for mobile applications
