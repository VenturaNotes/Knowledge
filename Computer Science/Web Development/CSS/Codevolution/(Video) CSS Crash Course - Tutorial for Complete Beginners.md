- Before we begin
	- This course is for complete beginners
	- Continuation of the HTML Crash Course

## What is CSS
- ![[Pasted image 20231128180616.png]]
- [[CSS]] stands for Cascading Style Sheets and is the language used to style an HTML document
- It is a [[stylesheet language]] and not a programming language
- With CSS, you control the layout of the webpage, the spacing between elements, what color the text should be in and so on
- Select HTML elements and apply styles
- How do I select an HTML element?
- How do I style that selected element?

## How to add CSS?
- 3 different ways to add CSS
	- [[Inline styles]]
		- CSS declarations that affect a single HTML element
			- A [[css declaration]] is a pair of property and its value
		- Add `<h1 style="color: orange" >CSS Crash Course </h1>`
		- Should avoid this method whenever possible
			- Difficult to maintain
			- Mixing HTML content with presentational code (more difficult to read + understand)
		- Use cases (more advanced from a beginners point of view)
			- Styling HTML templates for e-mails
			- Styling content in a content management system
	- [[Internal stylesheet]]
		- Defined inside a pair of style
	- [[External stylesheet]]
