- In digital signals, we discretize both time and magnitude
	- By discretization, we need to divide the time axis in equal intervals
		- If $\triangle t$ is the interval, then we can find it with

				- This is how we can find the interval
- We divide the magnitude axis in to fixed number of levels and the signal can take value equal to these levels only
