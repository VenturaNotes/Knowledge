- Most widely used tool by machine learning and data science practitioners today is the Jupyter Notebook. 
	- Default environment that many use to code up and experiment and try things out.
	- You can use a web browser to build and use a Jupyter Notebook environment to test out some of these ideas for yourself as well
	- Same environment/tool - the Jupyter notebook - that developers are using in large companies right now.
- One type of lab we'll see for this class are optional labs which are ones you can open and run one line at a time with usually no need to write any code yourself
- Optional labs designed to be very easy
- Two types of cells/blocks in the notebook.
	- Markdown cell (which means editable text)
		- It is typically text that describes the code
		- Hitting "shift + enter", will convert it back to nicely formatted text
	- code cell
		- Code is already provided in optional lab
		- Hitting "shift + Enter" will run code in code cell
- Optional lab shows common python code
