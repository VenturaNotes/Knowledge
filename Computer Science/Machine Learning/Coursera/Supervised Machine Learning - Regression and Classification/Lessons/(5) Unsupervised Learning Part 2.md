- Unsupervised learning
	- Data only comes with inputs x, but not output labels y.
	- Algorithm has to find structure in the data
	- Types
		- Clustering
			- Group similar data points together
		- Anomaly Detection
			- Find unusual data points.
				- Uses are fraud detection in financial system where unusual events or transactions could be signs of fraud
		- Dimensionality reduction
			- Compress data using fewer numbers
				- Lets you take a big data-set and almost magically compress it to a much smaller data-set while losing as little information as possible
- Question: 
	- Of the following examples, which would you address using an unsupervised learning algorithm?Â  (Check all that apply.)
	- Answer
		- Given a set of news articles found on the web, group them into sets of articles about the same stories
			- clustering example
		- Given a database of customer data, automatically discover market segments and group customers into different market segments
			- clustering example
	- Examples for supervised learning
		- Given email labeled as spam/not spam, learn a spam filter
		- Given a dataset of patients diagnosed as either having diabetes or not, learn to classify new patients as having diabetes or not
- Jupyter Notebooks are very useful in machine learning
