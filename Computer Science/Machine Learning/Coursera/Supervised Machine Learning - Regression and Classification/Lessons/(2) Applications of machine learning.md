- Machine learning is a sub-field of AI
- You can write a program to find the shortest path from a to b (such as in your GPS)
- Did not know how to explicitly write programs to
	- perform a web search
	- recognize human speech
	- diagnose diseases from X-rays
	- build a self-driving car
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">needed a machine to learn to do it by itself</mark>

	- AI dream of building machines as intelligent as you or me
	- Could take up to 50 or 500 years to get there.
- Machine learning estimated to create an additional 13 trillion US dollars of value annually by the year 2030
- Could also have value in
	- retail
	- travel
	- transportation
	- automotive
	- mateirals
	- manufacturing
