- Second most used form of machine learning

	- Given data that isn't associated with any output labels y.
	- If given data on patients and their tumor size and the patient's age (but not whether the tumor was benign or malignant)
	- Not asked to diagnose if the tumor is benign or not. Not given any labels y in the dataset
		- Job is to find something interesting in unlabeled data
			- such as pattern or structure
	- It's called unsupervised because we're not trying to supervise the algorithm to give a right answer for every input.
		- Instead, we ask the algorithm to figure out all by itself what's interesting or what patterns or structures that might be in this data.
	- With this kind of algorithm, it might decide that the data can be assigned to two different groups or two different clusters.
		- It might decide there is a cluster on the bottom-left and another cluster/group on the top-right.
			- This is known as a clustering algorithm
				- Places unlabeled data into different clusters and used in many applications
	- Clustering examples
		- Google news
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-24 at 5.22.20 AM.png]]
			- Looks at hundreds of thousands of news articles on the internet, and groups related stories together.
			- It was able to find articles with the words "panda", "twin", and "zoo" which it clustered with other articles to recommend you to read
				- found articles that mention similar words and grouping them into clusters
				- Clustering algorithm figures out on his own which words suggest, that certain articles are in the same group
					- Figures out the "clusters" of news articles today.
		- DNA microarray
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-24 at 5.30.53 AM.png]]
			- clustering genetic or DNA data
			- Each column represents the genetic or DNA activity of one person
			- Each row represents a particular gene
			- Researchers have found a genetic link to whether someone dislikes certain vegetables such as broccoli, brussel sprouts, or asparagus.
			- For DNA microarrays, the idea is to measure how much certain genes are expressed for each individual person
				- the colors red, green, gray show the degree to which different individuals do or do not have a specific gene active.
				- You can then run a clustering algorithm to group individuals into different categories or into different types of people
					- Could be grouped into type 1, type 2, and type 3.
					- Can help us figure out the major types of individuals
				- We're not giving the algorithm the right answers for the examples in advance.
		- Clustering: Grouping customers
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-24 at 5.36.57 AM.png]]
			- Many companies have huge databases of customer information.
			- Given this data, can you automatically group your customers into different market segments so that you can more efficiently serve your customers?
			- Concretely, deep learning dot AI team did research to better understand the deep learning dot AI community and why different individuals 
				- take these classes
				- subscribe to the batch weekly newsletter
				- attend AI events
			- Let's visualize the deep learning dot AI community as this collection of people. Running clustering, that is market segmentation, found a few distinct groups of individuals 
				- One group's primary motivation is seeking knowledge to grow their skills
				- Second group's primary motivation is looking for a way to develop their career
				- Third group wants to stay updated on how AI impacts their field of work
- A clustering algorithm is a type of unsupervised learning algorithm that takes data without labels and tries to automatically group them into clusters. 
	- There are other types of unsupervised learning algorithms
