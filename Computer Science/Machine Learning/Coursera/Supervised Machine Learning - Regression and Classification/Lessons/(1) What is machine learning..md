- [[Machine learning]]
	- "Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." - Arthur Samuel (1959)
- Arthur Samuel
	- Wrote a checkers program in the 1950s
	- Made a program  to play tens of thousands of games against itself
		- By watching what support positions wins and what positions lead to losses
			- the program learned over time what are good or bad positions
- Question: If Arthur Samuel's checkers-playing program had been allowed to play only 10 games (instead of tens of thousands games) against itself, how would this have affected its performance?
	- Answer: Would have made it worse
- In general, the more opportunities you give a learning algorithm to learn, the better it will perform.
- Machine Learning algorithms
	- Supervised learning
		- Used most in real-world applications
		- rapid advancements
		- (explained in course 1 and 2)
	- Unsupervised learning
		- explained in course 3
	- Recommender systems
	- Reinforcement learning
- Practical advice for applying learning algorithms
	- We get tools + the skills to use them effectively for this course
