	- What is a [[data structure]]?
		- A data structure (DS) is a way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively
		- Can be accessed, queried or perhaps even updated quickly and easily
	- Why data structures (makes the difference behind having an okay product and an outstanding one)?
		- They are essential ingredients in creating fast and powerful algorithms
		- They help to manage and organize data
		- They make code cleaner and easier to understand.
	- Abstract Data Types vs. Data Structures
	- [[Abstract Data Type]]
		- An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data structure which provides only the interface to which a data structure must adhere to.
		- The interface does not give any specific details about how something should be implemented or in what programming language.
		- Example: mode of transportation
			- walking, biking, taking a train, etc.
			- The specific modes of transportation would be analogous to the data structures themselves
			- Difference
				- We want to get from one place to another through some mode of transportation (abstract data type)
				- How did we do that exactly? (data structure)
	- Examples

- Abstract data type only defines how a data structure should behave and what methods it should have but not the details on how those methods will be implemented
