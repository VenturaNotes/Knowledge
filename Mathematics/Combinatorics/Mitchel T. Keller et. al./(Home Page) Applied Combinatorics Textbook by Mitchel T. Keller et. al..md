### (B.1) Introduction
- When writing with set-builder notation, you can also use a ":" to represent "such that"

		- Great source of reference [^1]

### (B.2) Intersections and Unions
- Inclusive version of "or" is used for this textbook
	- Meaning that at least one of the two requirements need to be satisfied
- $\cap$ and $\cup$ are commutative and associative [[Binary Operation|binary operations]] 
	- Commutative
		- ![[Pasted image 20221231103504.png]]
	- Associative
		- ![[Pasted image 20221231104114.png]]
- Distribution occurs
	- ![[Pasted image 20221231104143.png]]
		- In $\mathbb{N}$, multiplication distributes over addition but not vice-versa
			- This probably just means 4 $\times$(3 + 6) is possible but 3 +(4 $\times$ 6) is not able to distribute over.

#### Empty Set
- x $\notin$ $\varnothing$ for every element x
- For every set X
	- $X \cap \varnothing = \varnothing$
	- $X \cup \varnothing = X$

#### The First So Many Positive Integers
- $\mathbb{N}$
	- Set of positive integers
- $\mathbb{Z}$
	- The set of all integers (negative, positive, 0)
- $\mathbb{Q}$
	- The set of rational numbers (fractions)
- $\mathbb{R}$
	- The set of real numbers (rational and irrational)
- $\mathbb{N}_0$
	- The set of non-negative integers
- $[n]$
	- When $n$ is a positive integer, it is the set{1, 2, 3... n} of the first $n$ positive integers.
	- $[5]$ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
- $\textbf{n}$ 
	- Used to denote the n-element set {0, 1, 2, ...., n-1}
		- It's just the set of the first $n$ non-negative integers.
		- $\textbf{5}$ = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4}

#### Subsets, Proper Subset and Equal Sets
- X $\in$ Y when x $\in$ Y for every x $\in$ X
	- X is a subset of Y
- $X \subsetneq Y$ when y $\in$ Y but $y \notin X$
	- X is a proper subset ofY when 
	- The set of primes is a proper subset of $\mathbb{N}$
- It is possible to have the same set with different rules for membership
	- ![[Pasted image 20221231135046.png]]
	- ![[Pasted image 20221231135105.png]]
		- Both of the set above are the same.
	- This is a valid test for when sets are equal

### (B.3) Cartesian Products

- $X \times Y$ 
	- ![[Pasted image 20230102142411.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20230102142842.png]]
	- I'm not sure the answer to this. I just know that $\varnothing \subset {1}$ is true [^2]
- Cartesian products can also be defined for more than 2 factors
