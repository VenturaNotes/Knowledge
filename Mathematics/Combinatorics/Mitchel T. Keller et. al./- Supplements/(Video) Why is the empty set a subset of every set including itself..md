- A = {1, 2} and B = {1, 2, 3}
	- Is A a subset of B?
		- Yes
		- $A \subset B$ 
	- Is every element of A in B?
		- Yes
	- Can we find an element of A that is not in B?
		- No
	- Are we left with the empty set if we take away every element of B from A?
		- Yes
- B = {1, 2, 3} and A = {1,2}
	- Is B a subset of A?
		- No, B $\not \subset$ A
	- Is every element of B in A?
	- Can we find an element of B that is not in A?
		- Yes, 3
	- Are we left with the empty set if we take away every element of A from B?
		- No
- $\varnothing$ = {} and B = {1, 2, 3}
	- Is $\varnothing$ a subset of B?
		- Yes, $\varnothing$ $\subset$ B
	- Is every element of $\varnothing$ in B?
		- $\varnothing$ will be a subset of every set including itself
	- Can we find an element of $\varnothing$ that is not in B?
		- No
	- Are we left with the empty set if we take away every element of B from $\varnothing$? 
		- Yes
- Our last 2 answers in the 3rd example match up with our last 2 answers in the 1st example. So our conclusion must be that the empty set is a subset of B
