	- Given 5 numbers, we want to divide them evenly, fairly, into 2 groups
	- The goal is to find a way to sum the numbers together so that the left side is equal to the right side
	- Example
		- Given the numbers:
			- 12  17  22  31  48
		- we observe that 12 + 22 + 31 = 17 + 48
			- This is a [[fair division]]
	- Question
		- Can you find a [[fair division]] of the numbers:
			- 46  63  77  85  91  102  113  142  168  184  192  210  240  253  267  295  304  322  339  360  381  399  401  439  444  467  482  492  520  531  552
		- It is pretty difficult to solve this.
			- If you figure out it can be done, it's easy. You just have to show how it works
				- To confirm, it might take 2 minutes
			- If it's not possible, it would be more difficult to show

	- Slightly harder problem
		- Question: I have a 1.44 mb [[floppy disk]] full of integers. Can I be certain that the total computing power on the planet is enough to settle the fair division problem for this set of numbers?
			- There is no chance. This problem is too hard. Even if using all the computing power on the planet
