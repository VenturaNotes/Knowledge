	- [[Factoring]]
		- Question: Is the following number a prime?
		- A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of the digits is divisible by 3. Keeping track of residue of class
		- If divisible by 5, will end it a 0 or 5
		- 121722314823006489210074712319099317259
		- Question: If I told you the answer is no, would you believe me?
		- Question: If I told you that this number is divisible by 11 and 293, can you find the other factors?
			- This is true for problem
	- Output from [[Maple]]
		- Solution: Factorization provided by Maple
			- The tool [[Mathematica]] could be used as an alternative
			- Maple can factor the large number in 1 tenth of a second
		- Note: You could find the third factor by hand calculations in less than 10 minutes, How long would it take you to confirm that it is a prime?
	- Slightly Harder Problem
		- What is so important about factoring big numbers?
			- Someone who can factor integers with 200 digits because they'll be able to unlock [[public key cryptography]]
				- They would have access to valuable national and industrial secrets which are kept very close to the vest all around the world.
				- Will enable them to do things for good and bad
				- The threshold is around 130 digits (sharp threshold)
				- 200 digits is out of touch (probably in our lifetime)
