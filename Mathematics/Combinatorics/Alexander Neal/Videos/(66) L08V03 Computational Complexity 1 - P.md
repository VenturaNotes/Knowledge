	- Slide 1 ([[Computational Complexity]])
		- About the notion of [[NP-completeness]]
		- A very informal perspective
			- The class P consists of all "yes-no" questions for which the answer can be determined using an algorithm which is provable correct and has a running time which is [[polynomial]] in the input size
				- Some people write script p, boldface p, or capital P
			- Examples
				- (1) Given a list of n number s, is 2388643 in the list?
					- Is some specific integer in the list?
					- This problem is in the class p
						- Linear time
				- (2) Given a list of n numbers, can you find there distinct numbers a, b and c in the list so that a + b = c?
					- You write a loop for i=1 to n, j = i + 1 to n, k = j + 1 to n
					- [[Running time]] is $O(n^3)$ 
						- When we say runs in [[polynomial time]], it just means the running time is n to a constant for some constant and it's Big O of that
							- 10, 3 and $10^{10}$ are nice constants
				- (3) Given a [[graph]] G, does it have an [[Euler circuit]]?
					- Input size is number of lines in file
						- The input size for a graph is the number of edges. Could consider it to be the number of vertices because the number of [[edges]] is $O(n^2)$ 
							- A polynomial in a polynomial is a polynomial
