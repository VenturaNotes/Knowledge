	- Building on What we know
		- Restatement
			- How many solutions in non-negative integers to the equation
				- $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + ... x_n = m$
		- Answer
			- $m + n - 1 \choose n - 1$
		- Explanation
			- Add n artificial elements, one for each variable
				- For artificial objects, inflate the cell count by 1
		- What to do if we allow empty cells?
	- Mixed Problems
		- Problem
			- How many integer solutions in non-negative integers to the equation:
				- $x_1 + x_2 + x_3 + x_4 + x_5 + x_6 + x_7 = 142$
			- Subject to the constraints
				- $x_1, x_2, x_5, x_7 \ge 0;$
					- Need to add 4 artificial objects
				- $x_3 \ge 8;$ 
					- Set aside 7
				- $x_4 > 0;$
				- $x_6 > 19$
					- Set aside of size 19
		- Answer
			- $120 \choose 6$
		- Process
			- We started with 142 objects
			- Then we added artificial objects (4)
				- One for $x_1, x_2, x_5, x_7$ 
			- Total is now 146 objects
			- 146 - 7 = 139
			- 139 - 19 = 120
			- 120 objects into 7 bins gives $119 \choose 6$
