	- [[binomial coefficient|binomial coefficients]]
		- [[In Line Notation]]
			- C(38, 17) = P(38, 17)/17! = 38!/(21!17!)
				- This is the number of combinations of 38 objects taken 17 at a time
		- [[Graphic Notation]] (when looking at a mathematics or computer science paper you will very rarely see binomial coefficients written in line. Mostly through graphic notation)
			- $38 \choose 17$
			- Read this: "38 choose 17"
	- Binomial coefficients
		- Basic Definition
			- $38 \choose 17$ $= \frac {38!}{17!21}$
			- Note: To compute this binomial coefficient, you have to do a lot of multiplication and some division. May be there is an alternative way??!!
				- Be on the lookout for this
	- Beware Dot, dot, dot!!!
		- Question: What is really meant by the definitions:
			- $n! = n* (n-1)*(n-2)*...3*2*1$
			- $P(m, n) = m*(m-1) *(m-2)*...*(m-n+1)$
		- There is a lot of ambiguity with the definitions
	- A better way
		- Observation: Rather than writing 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ... be explicit and write: $a_n = n^2$
			- Good way to talk to machine
		- For second problem, write sum of preceding 2
			- Computers understand spaces but don't understand ...
	- A better way
		- For 1 + 2 + ... 6
			- Better way to represent it would be to define a loop
				- Define $S_0 = 0$ and when n $\ge$ 1, $S_n = n + S_{n-1}$. Then reference $S_6$
	- A better way for factorials
		- Definition 0! = 1 and when n > 1, n! = $n*(n-1)!$
			- If you don't add up anything, you don't get anything
				- Sums when you don't have anything in it you take to be 0
			- Products when you don't have anything in it, you take the product to be 1
				- How many combinations of no things taking none at a time are there is just 1, The [[empty set]]. Empty set not the same as the set which contains the empty set. The set that contains the empty set is no longer empty. So there's 1
		- Backtracking, we obtain 120 when n = 5

	- Better way
		- Same thing for [[Permutation|permutations]]
	- Coding Basics
		- Declaration
			- In modern c++, you need to declare a function first
		- Definition
			- If using equality as a test, you do ==
			- An assignment is one =
		- Potential trap is the [[stack]]
			- Need to recurse the stack to unwind the stack. That's bad programming practice.
			- Avoid a [[recursion]] that puts a lot of information on the stack
				- Good compilers may take care of that for you (will rewrite that code snippet and turn it into a loop which uses no memory)
		- For a recursive definition like this, you don't care about the memory concerns on the stack
	- Coding Basics
		- [[Permutation]] function in coding
			- The number of permutations of m things taken 1 at a time is just n.
		- Recursive definition is shown but computers (and mathematicians) are completely happy with that.
