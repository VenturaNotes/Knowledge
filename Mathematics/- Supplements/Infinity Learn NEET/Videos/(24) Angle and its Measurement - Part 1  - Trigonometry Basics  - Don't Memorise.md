	- Angle measurement
		- [[Angle]]: Measure of the rotation of a given [[ray]] about its initial point
			- [[Initial side]]
				- Initial position of ray
			- [[Terminal side]]
				- Final position of ray
			- Initial point can be called [[vertex]]
		- Counter clockwise gives positive angle measurement
		- Clockwise gives negative angle measurement
	- Units of measurement of angles (along with symbols)
		- One full rotation is 360 degrees
		- One [[minute]] is written as 1'
			- "1 Prime"
		- One [[second]] is written as 1''
			- 1 double prime
	- 1 degree = 60 minutes
	- 1 minute = 60 seconds
		- With smaller units of measurement, we can express an angle more accurately
	- We use [[Protractor|protractors]] to measure angles in geometry class
		- $\theta$ = 50$\degree$ 25' 10''
	- Manufacturing industry uses tools to measure angles in minutes and seconds
