	- [[Cartesian product]] of [[sets]]
	- Set T contains elements $T_A$ and $T_B$ 
	- Want to write all possible ways in which every teacher teaches every language
		- Can understand this using an [[arrow diagram]]
			- Use arrows to map every element in set T to every element in set C
			- Therefore, an arrow is drawn from every teacher to every course
	- We use [[round brackets]] because the order in which we write within the round brackets matters
	- Teacher teaches a course
		- [[Relation]] here is teaches
	- Every combination of (teacher, course) is called an [[ordered pair]]
		- Ordered pair implies order matters
		- represented using round brackets
	- The complete set of ordered pairs of (teacher, course) is nothing but the cartesian product of sets T and C
	- Cartesian product of sets T and C is written as $T \times C$ 
		- This is read as "T cross C"
		- "T cross C" is also a set
	- Ordered pairs enclosed in curly brackets and separated by commas
		- [[curly brackets]] are used to enclose elements in a set
		- {} $\to$ [[Set]] (order does not matter)
		- () $\to$ Encloses elements but order matters

	- [[Set-builder notation]]
	- $T \times C = \{(t, c): t \in T \text{ and } c \in C\}$ 
		- T cross C is equal to
