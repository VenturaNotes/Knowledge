	- [[Relation]]
		- Set of ordered pairs that satisfy a relationship
	- [[Cartesian product]]
	- [[Image]]
		- q is an 'image' of it's p
	- [[Range]]
		- Second elements of all ordered pairs is called the range
	- [[Domain (Math)|domain]]
		- The set of p of all ordered pairs in set R' is called the domain
		- The set of the first elements of all the ordered pairs in set R' is called the domain
	- [[Codomain]]
		- The whole set Q is called the codomain of relation R
		- Therefore, the 
	- Find a [[relation]] between the range and codomain
		- Can say that the range is a subset of the codomain
		- $\text{Range} \subseteq Q$ 
	- This is the domain, range, and codomain for our relation R
