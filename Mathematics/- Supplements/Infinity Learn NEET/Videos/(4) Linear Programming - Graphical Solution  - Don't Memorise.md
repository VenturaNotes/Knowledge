	- [[Linear Programming]] Problems
		- Meaning
		- Applications
		- Formulation
	- [[Optimal solution]]
		-  The maximum or minimum value of an objective function for the given problem
	- Problems with two variables can be solved graphically
	- [[Graphical Method]]
		- (1)
			- Maximize z = 20x + 15y (2 decision variables)
				- Subject to constraints
				- $200x + 150y \le 50,000$
				- $x+ = \le 500$
				- $x \ge 0$
		- More difficult to solve 3 decision variables graphically
			- Use the [[simplex method]] instead
	- To solve a [[linear inequality]] with two variables on a graph, use a coordinate plane
	- [[Coordinate plane]]
		- 4 quadrants
	- Non-negativity constraints (means only first quadrant)
		- $x \ge 0$
		- $y \ge 0$
	- Maximize the profit function: $z = 50x + 18y$ 
		- Subject to the constraints
		- For the [[inequality]] $2x + y \le 100$, the [[corresponding equation]] would be $2x + y = 100$
	- To find the optimal solution
		- Need to mark [[feasible region]] of the graph
			- This is the common region determined by all the constraints of a linear programming problem
			- Each point of a feasible region satisfies the linear inequalities of the problem
			- Every point within and on the boundary of the feasible region can be the feasible solution for the given problem
		- Will use [[corner point method]] since there will be many possible solutions for problem
			- This is used to find the maximum profit
			- In this method, the solution of a linear programming problem lies on the corner point of a feasible region
			- The coordinates of the corner points are substituted for the values of x and y in the objective function
	- [[Bounded feasible region]]?
	- [[Unbounded feasible region]]?
