	- All fall under the category of [[conic]]
		- The wheel is a [[Circle]]
		- Different types of shapes and curves occur in nature 
		- Earth's revolution around the sun is called an [[ellipse]]
		- When playing catch with someone, you create a u-shaped curve called a [[parabola]]
		- Two curves placed on either side of axis creates a [[hyperbola]]

	- Conics stands for conic sections
		- [[Conic sections]] means cross sections of a [[cone]]
	- 2 cones and the line makes a right angle with the surfaces, the shape is called a [[double right circular cone]]
		- 2 cones and the line makes a right angle with both circular bases
	- A [[plane]] intersecting horizontally gives a circle
	- A plane intersecting horizontally but tilted, you get an ellipse
	- Tilting more gets a parabola
	- Tilting plane vertically gives a hyperbola
	- Depending on the angle at which the plane intersects the cone, we get different curves
		- We're studying these shapes/curves since we see them in our daily life constantly in some for or another

	- Circular shapes
		- Wheel
		- Currency coins
	- Earth and sites in space move in an elliptical path (important for studying laws of universe)
	- Shape of satellite dish is a parabola
		- [[Parabola]] has the property to focus all the [[incident ray|incident rays]] on a single point
	- Shape of furnace
		- Curve is a hyperbola
		- Wonder why they are shaped that way?
