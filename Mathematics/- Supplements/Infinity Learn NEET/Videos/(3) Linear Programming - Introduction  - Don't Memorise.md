	- [[Linear Programming]]
	- Target Based Situations
		- Students needs to complete project in 15 days
			- Objective: Wants maximum score
			- Limiting factors: Time
		- Employee needs to achieve a sales target within a month
			- Objective: Wants maximum sales in a month
			- Limiting factors: Time
		- Another person needs to buy something within $500
			- Objective: Wants to minimize cost as much as possible
			- Limiting factors: Pre-decided budge
	- Objectives of above situations was to maximize the benefits or minimize the cost
		- These are [[optimization problems]] in mathematics
			- Maximum profit
			- Minimum cost
			- Minimum use of resources
		- Needs to be solved using [[optimization technique]]
	- [[Limiting factors]]
		- When there is a scarcity of some resource
		- Act as constraints in finding the best possible solution of the given problem
	- Optimization problems
		- Find the optimum solution subject to the \constraints of the problem
		- Find best possible outcome by allocating scarce resources
	- How are optimization problems solved in mathematics?
		- Comes from an area of math called [[optimization technique|optimization techniques]]
			- Many different categories of this
	- Classification of optimizing methods
		- The type of solved problem
			- Linear Programming
			- Non-linear optimization
		- Constraints
			- Optimization with constraints
			- Optimization without constraints
		- Size of Problem
			- One-dimensional methods
			- Multi-dimensional methods
		- Optimization criteria
			- One objective methods
			- Multi-objectives methods
