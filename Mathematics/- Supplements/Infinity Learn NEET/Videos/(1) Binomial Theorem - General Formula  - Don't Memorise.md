	- [[Pascal's Triangle]]
		- Each term is the sum of the other 2 terms above it
		- In the expansion, it gives us the [[binomial coefficient|binomial coefficients]]
	- [[Permutation|Permutations]] and [[Combination|Combinations]]
		- Will only require combinations here
		- Given formula
			- $^nC_r$ $\to$ 'n' items taken 'r' at a time (order does NOT matter)
	- Able to apply above to [[binomial theorem]]
	- Relation between combinations and pascal's triangle
	- Each number in pascal's triangle is given by a combination $^nC_r$ where n is the row number and r will be the number in the range 0 to n
	- Better to use combinations to find a number in the 8th row of Pascal's Triangle. Saves a lot of time

	- $(a + b)^n$ 
		- n is any positive integer
		- To get the binomial coefficients, we can use the formula of combinations
		- Other terms consisting of a and b?
			- The power of 'a' decreases in each term
			- The power of ' b' increases in each term
	- We have the general formula which will help us expand the binomial of any power very easily
