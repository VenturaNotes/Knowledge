	- Every [[function (math)|function]] is a [[relation]]
	- Not every [[relation]] is a [[function (math)|function]]
	- Lets say there is a relation R from set A to set B
	- Can type of mapping help us determine if it's a function or relation?
	- There are four different types of [[mapping]]
		- 1 - 1
			- [[One-to-one mapping]]
				- Relation is a function
			- When each element in the [[range]] is an [[image]] of exactly one element in the domain
			- Relation from A to B is a function if (only condition for a relation to be a function)
				- Every element in A
				- One and only one image in set B
		- 1 - n
			- [[One-to-many mapping]]
				- Not a function
			- When an element in the [[Domain (Math)|domain]] has more than one [[image]] in the [[range]]
		- n - 1
			- [[Many-to-one mapping]]
				- Function
			- Every element in set A has only one image in set B
				- Doesn't matter even if it's the same image 
		- n - n
			- [[Many-to-many mapping]]
				- Not a function
			- More than one element in set A has more than one image in set B

	- When the mapping is one-to-one or many-to-one, the relation is a function
	- When the mapping is one-to-many or many-to-many, the relation is not a function
