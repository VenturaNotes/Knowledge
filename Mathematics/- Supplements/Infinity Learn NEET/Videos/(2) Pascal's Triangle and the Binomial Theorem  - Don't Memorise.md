	- [[Binomial theorem]]
	- [[Pascal's Triangle]]
		- Triangle made up of numbers
		- Each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it
		- All numbers on extreme left and right are 1
		- Rows are numbered starting from 0
		- You can find diagonals on both sides which are the set of [[natural numbers]]
		- There is a diagonal that for each number, you can form [[equilateral triangle|equilateral triangles]]
			- Known as [[triangular numbers]]
		- Sum of each row can be represented as $2^{\text { number of the row}}$ 
	- $(a+b)^2$
		- The power of a binomial is also known as the [[- Topics/index]] of the binomial
	- [[binomial coefficient|binomial coefficients]]
		- Coefficients of each term in the expansion of the binomial
		- The numbers in the second row of pascal's triangle is the same as the coefficients in the expansion with index 2
			- Each row in a Pascal's triangle gives us the binomial coefficients for the expansion having any index
