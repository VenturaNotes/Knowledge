	- [[Inductive reasoning]]
		- Specific to general (Specific argument $\to$ General Conclusion)
			- logically true
			- May or may not be realistically true
		- Example 1
			- Let's say you have mangoes in a basket and you want to know if they're raw or ripe. If you take 2 out and see they're raw, you can generalize that the rest of them are raw.
		- Example 2
			- Statement 1: Mango is a Fruit (Specific Statement)
			- Statement 2: The box is full of Fruits (Specific Statement)
			- Conclusion: The box is full of Mangoes (General Conclusion)
				- Logically True
				- But realistically may or may not be true
	- [[Deductive reasoning]]
		- Logically true
		- Realistically true
		- General argument $\to$ Specific Conclusion

	- Deductive reasoning
		- Statement 1: All mangoes are fruits (General Statement)
		- Statement 2: All fruits have seeds (General Statement)
		- Conclusion: Mangoes have seeds (Specific Conclusion)
			- Logically true
			- Realistically true
	- Inductive reasoning frequently used in mathematics
		- By observing the pattern that exists in a particular case, we induce a general conclusion from that outcome
			- The conclusion we arrive at based on inductive reasoning is called a [[conjecture]]
				- A conjecture is a hypothesis that has not been proven
					- Just because we observe a pattern in many cases, it doesn't mean it holds true for all cases
					- Mary not be true
					- Conjectures must be proved for that particular case
	- To prove such conjectures, the [[principle of mathematical induction]] is used
