	- [[Linear Programming]]
		- Technique which helps us to find the optimum solution for a given problem
	- [[Optimum solution]]
		- Best possible outcome for a given problem
	- Types of linear programming problems
		- Product mix
		- Diet problem
		- The portfolio selection problem
		- Media selection
		- Blending problem
		- Transportation problem
		- Travelling salesman problem
	- Structure and the [[formulation of a linear programming problem]] (process shown below)
		- Understand given problems
		- Convert to Linear Programming problem
	- Two aspects
		- Formulation part
		- Solution part

	- Good idea to represent problems in [[tabular form]]
	- Budget constraint: $200x + 150y \le 50,000$ 
	- Total Demand Constraint: $x + y \le 500$ 
	- [[Objective function]]
		- In a linear programming problem, it's a mathematical expression of the ultimate goal
		- $z = 20x + 15y$
	- Can number of units be negative?
		- No (so [[non-negative constraints]])
			- Important for formulation in a linear programming problem
	- As the problem is formulated in the linear form, it's called as [[linear programming]]
