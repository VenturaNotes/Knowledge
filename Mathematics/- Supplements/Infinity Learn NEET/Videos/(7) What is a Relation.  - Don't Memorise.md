	- [[Relation]]
		- Gives a set of [[ordered pair|ordered pairs]] that satisfy a relationship
	- [[Cartesian product]]
		- $P \times Q$ 
	- [[Set-builder notation]]
		- $P \times Q = \{(p,q): p \in P, q \in Q\}$
	- Relation 'R':
		- Gives us a set of all ordered pairs that satisfy a relation
		- Could be any relation
	- If we introduce a relation R' such that q is a multiple of p
		- R' is read as "R dash"
	- We can say that relation R' gives us a set of all ordered pairs where q is a multiple of p
		- Every ordered pair in the set R' satisfies the relation R'
	- [[Roster method]]
		- Roster means list
		- $R' = \{(2,10), (2,20), (4,20)\}$
	- Could be represented using an [[arrow diagram]]
	- R' will be a subset of the cartesian product $P \times Q$
