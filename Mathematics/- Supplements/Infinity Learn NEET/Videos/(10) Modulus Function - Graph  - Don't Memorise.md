	- [[Modulus Function]]
	- What is the [[modulus]] of a number?
		- Just its [[absolute value]]
			- Absolute value gives distance of number from 0 without considering direction in which number lies
	- Modulus of a number gives [[magnitude]] of number
		- Magnitude of number can either be [[positive]] or 0
			- +ve is positive
			- Never negative (-ve)
	- The [[absolute value]] of a number is always [[nonnegative]]
	- [[Modulus function]]
		- $f(x) = |x|$ 
			- "f of x is equal to modulus of x"
			- Input $\to$ Any real value of x
			- Output $\to$ |x|
				- |x| is the magnitude of x
		- when x is 0 or positive, f(x) = x
		- When x is negative, f(x) = -x
		- For y = f(x)
			- We get a V shaped curve, vertex at (0, 0)
			- Slope right-side of vertex is = 1
			- Slope left side of vertex = -1
			- All y-values are positive for modulus function
			- Curve is symmetric about the y-axis
			- Domain: $\mathbb{R}$ 
			- Range: $[0, \infty)$ 
				- Opening square bracket tells us that 0 is included
				- Closing round bracket tells us that it can take values up to infinity
