	- [[Parabola]]: Collection of points in a plane which are equidistant form a fixed point and a fixed line in the plane
		- [[Axis]] of parabola is perpendicular to the directrix
	- Equation of a parabola
	- Can use [[distance formula]] to find distance between two points
	- Deriving the equation of a parabola
		- Need to know if the reverse direction follows when getting the equation of a parabola
		- To check: Any point satisfying the equation $y^2 = 4ax$ will always be on the parabola
	- Given the type of parabola: $P(x, y) (\text{Parabola}) \to y^2 = 4ax$
		- Axis along x-axis
		- Vertex at origin
		- Oriented towards positive x-axis direction
	- a is a positive constant which is the distance between the focus and the vertex
	- Will learn in next video equation of parabola with a different orientation
