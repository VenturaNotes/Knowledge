	- [[Circle]]
		- Collection of points
		- A set of points on the same plane which are at an equidistance from a single point form a circle
			- Single point is called center of circle
			- Distance between center and all points is called [[radius]] of circle
	- Branches of [[mathematics]]
		- [[Geometry]]
		- [[Algebra]]
		- [[Number Theory]]
		- [[Logic]]
	- The algebra representation of any geometrical figure is called an [[equation]]
		- Center has coordinates (h, k)
		- Get any point on the circle P, and have its coordinate (x, y)
		- Denote radius by r
		- Can use [[distance formula]] to derive equation of circle
			- $\sqrt{(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 }=r$
		- [[General equation of the circle]] (standard form)
			- $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$ 
	- Equation of [[circle]] with origin at center
		- $x^2 + y^2 = r^2$ 
	- Showed how to represent circle in geometrical form and algebraic form
