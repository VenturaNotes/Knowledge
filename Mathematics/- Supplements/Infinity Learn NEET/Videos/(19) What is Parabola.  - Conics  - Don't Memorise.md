	- Shape of [[dish satellite]]?
		- It's parabolic in shape
	- Mirror used in flashlight also has parabolic shape
		- Bulb placed at focus of parabolic mirror. Therefore, the light emitted will be reflected in the forward direction
	- Due to the parabolic shape of a dish satellite, all the incoming signals falling on the dish are reflected towards a single point. This is where the [[receiver]] is placed. The parabolic shape helps concentrating all the incoming signals at a single point Such a point in a parabola is called the [[focus]]
		- Every parabola has a focus point
	- Circle: Set of all points in a plane equidistant from a fixed point (center of the circle)
	- A [[parabola]] is defined using its focus point
	- [[Parabola]]: Set of points in a plane which are equidistant from point F and line l in the plane
		- Point F is known as the [[focus]] of the parabola
		- Line l is called its [[directrix]]
	- The part of the parabola above the line is the mirror image of its spot below the line
	- The line where the parabola is symmetric about is called its [[axis]]
		- The point where the parabola intersects the axis is called its [[vertex]]
		- Distance of vertex from directrix is same as the distance from the focus
	- Parabola: Collection of points in a plane which are equidistant from a fixed point (Focus) and a fixed line (Directrix) in the plane
	- In next video, will learn about equation of parabola
