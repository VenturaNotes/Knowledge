	- [[Ellipse]]: Set of points such that the sum of distances of each point from two fixed points is constant
		- Can also draw 2 axis of symmetry for ellipse (These axes can be on the x or y axis depending on orientation of ellipse)
			- [[Major axis]]
			- [[Minor axis]]
		- The point equidistant of the foci is called the center of the ellipse
	- Equation of ellipse 
		- Coordinate axis: x-axis and y-axis
		- Simplest:
			- Center at origin
			- Foci on the x-axis or y-axis
	- The two orientations shown are the only ones
	- Ellipse
		- Points $\to$ sum of distances from the foci is constant = 2a (length of major axis)
		- $c = \sqrt{a^2 - b^2}$

	- Need to check the converse of the formula
	- Given P(x, y) on Ellipse $\to$ $\frac {x^2}{a^2} + \frac {y^2}{b^2} = 1$
		- To check: Any point satisfying the equation will always be on the ellipse
