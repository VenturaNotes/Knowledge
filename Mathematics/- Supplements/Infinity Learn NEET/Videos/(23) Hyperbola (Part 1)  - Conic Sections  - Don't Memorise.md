	- Conic Sections
		- [[Circle]]
		- [[Ellipse]]
		- [[Parabola]]
		- [[Hyperbola]]
	- [[Hyperbola]]: It is not two parabolas (mirror images of each other)
	- [[Cooling towers]] have a [[hyperboloid shape]]
		- Efficiency (heat removal process)
		- Structurally strong
		- Construction (cost-effective)
	- Trajectory of comets
		- Planets stuck in orbit will move in an ellipse
		- A comet traveling at a very high velocity will escape the sun's gravity causing it to travel in a hyperbolic path (these kind of comets only pass through the solar system once)
	- [[Hyperbola]]
		- Set of points in a plane such that the difference in distances of each point from two fixed points ($F_1$ and $F_2$) in the plane is constant
			- Made up of two curves which are mirror images of each other
		- Difference:
			- Distance to the farther point - distance to the closer point
			- The fixed points are called the foci of the hyperbola

	- The constant difference is $\alpha$ 
		- A constant ==greater== than $\alpha$ will make the hyperbola ==narrower==
		- A constant ==less== than $\alpha$ will make the hyperbola ==wider==
	- Definition similar to [[ellipse]]
		- Set of points in a plane such that the ==sum== of distances of each point from two fixed points is constant
			- a = length of semi-major axis
			- b = length of semi-minor axis
			- c = distance from center to one of the ellipse's foci
		- For hyperbola, it's difference
