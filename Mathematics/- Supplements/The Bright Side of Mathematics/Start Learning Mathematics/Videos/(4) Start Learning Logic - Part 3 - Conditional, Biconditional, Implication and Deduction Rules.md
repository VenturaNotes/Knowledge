	- [[Logical Operations]]
		- [[Implication|conditional]] (some people call it implication)
			- A $\to$ B
				- If A, then B
			- When using doubled arrow $\implies$ means normal arrow $\to$ gives a [[tautology]]
		- Since $A \land B \to B$ gives a tautology, 
			- then we can write $A \land B \implies B$
				- We actually call this one an implication. It is almost the normal conditional just with an extra bit of information 
		- [[Biconditional]] (just a normal conditional in both directions)
			- $A \leftrightarrow B$ 
				- A if and only if B
				- Truth values of both sides should coincide
			- $\iff$ means $\leftrightarrow$ gives tautology
	- [[Contraposition]]
		- $A \to B$ $\iff$ $\lnot B \to \lnot A$ 
			- You can change order of conditional but will need to add negation sign on both sides
			- Left side
				- If there is fog, then we have poor visibility.
			- Right side
				- If we don't have poor visibility, there is no fog
	- [[Deduction rules]]: tells us how we get new two logical statements out of known two logical statements 
		- (how to get new true propositions from other true propositions)
		- Don't have to write down truth tables anymore because we can just apply the rules
		- [[Modus ponens]]
			- We have 2 [[antecedent|premises]]
			- If A $\to$ B true and A true, then: B true
				- Get out a third true statement
		- [[Chain syllogism]]
			- If $A \to B$ true and $B \to C$ true, then $A \to C$ true
		- [[Reductio ad absurdum]]
			- If $A \to$ B true and $A \to \lnot B$ true, then $\lnot A$ true
				- A implies a [[contradiction]] and therefore it must be false
