	- Start learning [[Logic]]
	- Logical statement ([[proposition]]): [[Statement]] (a meaningful declarative sentence which has a well-defined truth value. Either true or false)
		- Cannot take opinions or questions
		- Examples: 
			- (a) Mars is a planet
				- True logical statement
			- (b) Pluto is a planet
				- False logical statement
			- (c) 1 + 1 = 2
				- True logical statement
			- (d) The number 5 is smaller than the number 2
				- False logical statement
			- (e) Good morning!
				- Not a logical statement
			- (f) x + 1 = 1
				- [[Predicate]]
				- Not a logical statement
				- Variable x is not fixed so statement does not have a well-defined truth value
				- When x gets a value, the statement becomes a logical statement
	- [[Logical operations]] (gives new logical statements)
		- [[Negation]]: For a logical statement A, $\lnot A$ denotes the negation. (Read as "not A")
			- [[Truth table]]
				- All possible inputs and corresponding outcomes
		- [[Conjunction]]
			- True when A and B are true simultaneously
			- Good visualization would be a circuit with a lamp and battery
				- Put A and B as switches into circuit
					- Need both switches to be on to get an on output
