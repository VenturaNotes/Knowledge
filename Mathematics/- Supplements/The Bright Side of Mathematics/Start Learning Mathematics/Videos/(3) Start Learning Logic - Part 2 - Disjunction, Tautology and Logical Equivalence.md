	- [[Proposition|logical statements]] A, B $\to$ new logical statements
	- Given $\lnot A$ and $A \land B$
		- A and B are considered [[logical variables]]
		- $\lnot$ and $\land$ are [[logical operations]]
			- $\lnot$: not operation
			- $\land$: and operation
	- [[Logical operations]]
		- [[Disjunction]]
			- $A \backslash B$ denotes disjunction
			- Means "or"
			- At least one needs to be true
		- Given $\lnot A \lor A$, it's a [[tautology]] (always true)
			- (Independent of the truth values of the logical variables that are contained)
			- Helpful to know if a statement is a tautology because you can just substitute it with "True"
	- [[Logical equivalence]]: (tells you when you can substitute one formula with another)
		- Two logical statements are logically equivalent if the [[truth table]] looks the same for both
		- Two logical statements are called logically equivalent if the truth tables (all possible arrangements of truth values for the logical variables) are the same.
		- Used to simplify a complicated expression step by step
	- Example
		- $\lnot (A \lor B) \iff (\lnot A) \land (\lnot B)$
			- The double arrow means you can substitute each other without changing the truth value
