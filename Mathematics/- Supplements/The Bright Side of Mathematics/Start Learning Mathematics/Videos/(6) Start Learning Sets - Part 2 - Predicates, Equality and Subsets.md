	- Will talk about how to form new [[set|sets]]
		- Comes from logic and called [[predicate]]
			- n is an even number
			- x is an animal
			- y + 8 = 9
			- Variables are just placeholders
				- When put in a chosen object, you get out a logical statement
	- [[Predicate]]
		- An expression with undetermined variables that ascribes a property to objects filled in for the variables.
	- Form new sets: {$x \in \mathbb{N} | x \text{ is an even number}$}
		- The set of all x in $\mathbb{N}$ that satisfy x is an even number
		- This set contains each element from the bigger set that gives a true logical statement when putting it into the predicate
			- Bigger set = $\mathbb{N}$
			- predicate = $x$ is an even number
				- The element relation we have for sets is always a predicate
	- How many objects satisfy the [[predicate]]?
	- [[Quantifiers]]
		- [[For all]]: $\forall$ 
			- You go through all the objects and you would use the correct variable and put it right next to it
			- $\forall x$
				- Read as "for all x"
		- [[It exists]]: $\exists$ 
			- Find at least one object and we use the correct variable such as x
			- $\exists x$ 
				- Read as "it exists at least one object x" or "it exists x"
	- We always combine a [[quantifiers|quantifier]] with a [[predicate]]. What comes out is a [[Proposition|logical statement]].
	- Example
		- $\forall x : x \text{ is a planet}$ 
			- Since we go through all the objects x and check each object if it's a planet, we don't have any undetermined variable left. Therefore, we get out a logical statement with a well-defined truth value
				- Not every object is a planet so false
	- The exists quantifier always has an "at least" in the meaning
	- [[Equality for sets]]: 
		- Two sets A, B are the same written as A = B if $\forall x$ : x $\in$ A $\iff$ x $\in$ B is true
			- Two sets should be the same when they contain the same elements
	- [[colon-equals symbol]]
		- Can assign left to right or right to left
			- $C := \{2, 3, 5\}$
			- $\{3, 5, 2\} =: D$
				- The colon tells you where the new name is introduced

	- {2, 3, 5} = {2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 5}
		- Two sets are equal even when elements are repeating (though repeating elements not typically represented)
	- [[Subsets]]
		- For two sets A, B, we write A $\subseteq$ B if is true (note that sometimes the line underneath is omitted)
		- $\forall x : x \in A \to x \in B$ 
			- Short notation: $\forall x \in A : x \in B$ 
		- We call A a [[subset]] of B.
			- (We can also write B $\supseteq$ A)
				- Can be helpful to write subset on righthand side
