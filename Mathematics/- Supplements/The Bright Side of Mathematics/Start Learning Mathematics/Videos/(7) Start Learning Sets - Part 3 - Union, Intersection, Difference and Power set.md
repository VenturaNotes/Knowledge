	- [[Subset]] symbol
		- A $\subseteq$ B
			- Can say that B is a [[superset]] of A
			- Can say that A is a [[subset]] of B
		- By definition $B \subseteq B$ (every [[set]] is a subset of itself)
			- Line underneath needed to remind you that the equality is possible
			- A lot of people omit the line and just use $\subset$ for subsets
	- [[Empty set]]
		- Always a subset
			- $\varnothing \subseteq B$ 
		- no elements at all
			- So subset relation is true
	- [[Union]]: Merging 2 sets
		- A $\cup$ B := {x | x $\in$ A $\lor$ x $\in$ B}
			- Don't need a bigger set to take the elements out of
			- Not all predicates on righthand side are allowed
			- But this one here is allowed
		- If you have 2 sets, you can always form a new set given by the union
	- [[Intersection]]
		- Collection of all elements that both sets share
		- $A \cap B := \{x | x \in A \land x \in B\}$
	- [[Difference of sets|Set Difference]]
		- Subtraction of sets
		- Subtract the set B from set A
		- $A \backslash B$ : = {x | x $\in$ A $\land$ x $\notin$ B}
			- A without B
	- What happens if we want to form unions or intersections with more than 2 sets?
	- [[Big union]]
		- Need: I set, $A_i$ set for each i $\in$ I
			- "I" is a fixed given set
			- $A_i$ is a set for each element $i$ from the capital I
		- Use the elements from the set I as indices (could have many sets in this case)
		- $\bigcup_{i \in I} A_i$ := {x | $\exists$ i $\in$ I : x $\in$ $A_i$ }

	- [[Big Intersection]]
		- $\bigcap_{i \in I}A_i$ := { x | $\forall i \in I$ : $x \in A_i$ } 
			- Should contain the points that are shared by all the sets
	- [[Power set]]
		- For a set A define P(A) := {X | X $\subseteq$ A}
			- An element of P(A) is always a set itself
			- The set of all subsets of A
		- The set that contains all the subsets of A
		- Number of elements
			- |A| = 3
			- |P(A)| = 8 = $2^3$ 
				- General formula is $2^{|A|}$
