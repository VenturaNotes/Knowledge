	- [[Set theory]]
		- You can describe everything in mathematics just by using [[set|sets]]
	- Could see the field of [[logic]] to get out of set theory as the foundation of mathematics
	- Logic + Axioms of set theory = foundation of mathematics $\to$ doing mathematics (goal)
		- However, this path is way too long and needs a lot of time such you should never do that at the beginning of your mathematical career
			- Shortcut (goes straight to doing mathematics)
				- [[Propositional logic]]
				- [[Naive set theory]]
	- Axioms of set theory
		- List of propositions assumed to be true
	- [[Set]]: Collection of distinct objects into a whole
		- Not a correct definition but an idea we have in mind written down
		- such an object x inside a set M is called an [[members|element]] of M
			- $x \in M$ 
		- If x is not such an object inside the set M, we write $x \notin M$ 
	- A set can be defined by giving all its elements: inside curly brackets
		- No order
		- A := {2, 5, 6}
			- Lefthand side is defined by the righthand side
			- Sign that reminds you that a new name/variable is introduced at this point
			- := means [[defined by]]
	- [[Empty set]]
		- Has no elements at all $\varnothing$ := {}
	- [[Natural numbers]]: $\mathbb{N}$ 
	- [[Natural Numbers]] (including zero): $\mathbb{N_0}$ 
	- [[Integers]]: $\mathbb{Z}$ 
	- [[Rational numbers]]: $\mathbb{Q}$
	- [[Real Numbers]] $\mathbb{R}$
	- [[Complex Numbers]] $\mathbb{C}$
	- [[Quantifiers]]
		- Reversed letters A and E
			- $\forall$ $\exists$ 
	- [[predicate|Predicates]]
		- something with a variable that becomes a logical statement if we set a value for x
		- $x \in \mathbb{N}$
			- Example of predicate
