	- The difference between
		- (1) [[No real value]]
		- (2) [[No solution]]
		- (3) [[Doesn't exist]]
		- (4) [[Undefined]]
		- (5) [[Indeterminate]]

	- (1) No Real Value Examples (sqrt of negative, logarithm of negative)
		- When a solution has a complex value
			- $\sqrt{neg}$ 
				- Square root of any negative number
			- ln(neg)
				- logarithm of a negative number has a complex value as well
	- (2) No Solution Examples (for equations: sqrt equaling negative, absolute value equaling negative)
		- No real solution
			- If you don't have complex numbers, there'd be no <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">real</mark> solution but it has a complex solution (x = $\pm$ 4i)
		- No solution at all
			- square root of a variable to equal a negative number
			- Absolute values equaling a negative number
	- (3) Doesn't exist Examples (for limit)
		- $\lim_{x\to \infty}$
			- Does there exist a number that $sinx$ is approaching when x is approaching infinity?
	- (4) Undefined Example (for computation)
		- $\frac 60$
		- $2^0$ = 1
			- By definition is equal to 1
				- Technically, this is not a proof. You can't prove a definition
		- $0^0$ is undefined since we don't have a definition for that.
	- (5) Indeterminate (For limit)
		- When you get $\frac 00$ for finding a limit, it's usually an indicator to do more work.
			- Doesn't tell you any information about the answer. That's why we say "indeterminate". You can't draw any conclusion yet.
				- If you get indeterminate, you need to do more work.
		- [[Indeterminate family]] (for limit)
			- $\frac 00, \frac {\infty}{\infty}$
				- $1^{\infty}$, $0*\infty$, $\infty^0$, $\infty$ - $\infty$, $0^0$
