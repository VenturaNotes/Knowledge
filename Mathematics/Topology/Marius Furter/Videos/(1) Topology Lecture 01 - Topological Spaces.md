	- [[Topology]]
		- Will introduce basics of [[point set topology]]
			- Will include definition of [[topological space]]
			- Will look at special types of spaces
				- [[Hausdorff space]]
		- Will learn how to construct new topological spaces from old ones
			- by forming products or [[disjoint unions]]
		- Will look at properties of [[connectedness]] and [[compactness]]
		- Main goal of series is to build groundwork so we can later go on to [[algebraic topology]]
	- Book: "Introduction to topological manifolds" by John Lee #archive
		- Focuses on [[manifold theory]]
	- Prerequisites
		- Sets / functions
			- Should know what a function is between sets
		- Basic knowledge of [[euclidean space]] $\mathbb{R}^n$ 
			- Would get this knowledge from a [[calculus]] course
		- Should know what a [[continuous real valued function]]
		- Should have some familiarity with equations and manipulation of equations
