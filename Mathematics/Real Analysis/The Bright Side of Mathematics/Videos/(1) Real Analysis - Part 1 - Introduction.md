	- Analysis that we can do with the [[real numbers]]
	- The topic of [[real analysis]] is also known as [[calculus]]
		- Other names are analysis, infinitesimal calculus
	- Goal: Understanding [[differential]] and [[integral]] calculations
		- Will understand $\frac {df}{dx}$ and $\int_a^bfdx$ 
	- Topics
		- Sequences of real numbers
		- [[Limits]]
		- [[Continuity]]
		- [[derivative|derivatives]]
		- [[integral|integrals]]
	- Foundation: [[Real numbers]]: $\mathbb{R}$
