	- [[Functional analysis]] part 1
		- It is a really wide field
	- Given two blocks [[linear algebra]] and [[Real and complex analysis]]
		- If you look at infinite dimensional spaces in a linear algebra sense and you want to apply some analysis on these spaces, then you are in the realm of functional analysis
	- [[Functional analysis]]
		- Consider spaces consisting of [[functions]] or [[Sequence|Sequences]]
			- [[Function space]]
			- [[Sequence space]]
		- Also consider [[linear maps]] between [[Subspace|subspaces]]
		- In this field, we always combine [[algebraic structures]] with [[analytic properties]]
		- Functional analysis often summarized by saying
			- Study of [[topological algebraic structures]]
				- [[Topology]] plays a role here
				- Not a bad idea to start with topology before doing functional analysis
	- To start with something that is closer to a normal analysis course, we start with a structure we call a [[metric space]]
		- We start with a set X and visualize that as a collection of points
			- We have 2 elements `x` and `y`
		- If we just consider a set, we can't say anything about these points (besides they're equal or not)
			- So they are different points but don't know anything else
		- So we want to give set X more structure
			- Would like to know distance between points (so we need reasonable properties)
				- Distance should always be positive (it could be zero but that's only the case if they're the same point)
				- To formalize this, we need to write down a [[map]]
		- This map is called a [[metric]] and it measures distances
			- Will be given 2 points (so it lives on [[Cartesian product]] of X with X or $X \times X$ )
			- Then it maps into the non-negative real numbers
		- A [[metric]]: $d: X \times {X} \to [0, \infty]$ 
			- We call a map a metric if it fulfills three properties
				- (1) $d(x, y) = 0 \iff x = y$
					- The distance between two points is 0 iff x is equal to y
				- (2) $d(x, y) = d(y, x)$
					- The distance from x to y should be the same distance from y to x
					- This means for a map, it's [[symmetric]] (does not matter which is the first or second element. We get the same result)
						- #question Does being symmetric make it commutative?
						- #question What is the relationship between symmetry, distributive, associative, and commutative? 
				- (3) $d(x,y) \le d(x,z) + d(z, y)$ 
					- Last property is the [[triangle inequality]]
						- Now we consider 3 points instead of 2
						- Given a 3rd point `z`, the triangle inequality tells you that if you go on a detour, then your distance gets longer.
							- In other words, if you go from `x` to `z` to `y`, this will be longer than going directly from `x` to `y`
			- Now with such a map, we can now measure all the distances in the set X. Therefore, we call the set X with the metric `d` a [[metric space]]
			- And if we can measure distances, we can do a lot of analytical stuff
