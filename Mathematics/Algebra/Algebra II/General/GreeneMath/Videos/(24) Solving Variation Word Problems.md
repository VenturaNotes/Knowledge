	- [[Direct Variation]]
		- y varies directly with (as) x if there exists a real number k such that
			- $y = kx$
				- k = [[constant of variation]]
	- At a local gas station, the price per gallon of gas is $4.30:

	- y varies directly with the nth power of x if there exists a real number k such that:
		- $y = kx^n$

	- For [[inverse variation]], y depends on some constant value k, divided by k:
		- $y = \frac kx$
	- We can use our distance formula as an example. Think about using distance as a constant, time now varies inversely with the rate:
	- We also see inverse variation as a power

	- Lastly, let's talk about [[joint variation]]. This occurs with the product of two or more variables, sometimes raised to powers:
	- Solving Variation Problems
		- Start by finding the value for k
		- Rewrite the equation with the known value for k
		- Substitute what is given and solve

	- If y varies directly with x and y = 12 when x = 4, find y when x = -5

	- For a given principal, the amount of [[simple interest]] earned varies jointly with rate and time. If $9000 was earned after 6 years at 3% annual simple interest, how much would be earned after 10 years at 12% annual simple interest?
		- I = Prt
			- I = simple interest earned
			- P = Principal
			- r = rate
			- t = time
	- Over a given distance, speed varies inversely with time. If a car travels a set distance in 10 hours going 110 mph, , what speed is needed to go the same distance in 4 hours?
