	- Solving systems of [[linear inequality|linear inequalities]]
		- Find where the two graphs overlap
		- Area of coordinate plane that satisfies both
	- Since the inequalities are [[strictly greater than]] and [[strictly less than]], the boundary line won't be part of the solution
		- Graph with a broken or dashed boundary line
	- Must flip direction of inequality symbol when multiplying by a negative
	- Solid boundary for
		- less than or equal to
		- greater than or equal to
	- For second problem, knew there was no solution before graphing because inequality signs point the opposite way while the slope is the same and considering the y-intercept
	- The part that is shaded in yellow is the region of the graph that will satisfy the system
