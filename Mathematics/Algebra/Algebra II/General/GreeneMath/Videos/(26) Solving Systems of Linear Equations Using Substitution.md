	- Solving [[Linear Systems in two Variables]] with [[Substitution]]
		- Solve one of the equations for one of the variables
		- Substitute for that variable in the other equation
		- Solve the linear equation in one variable
		- Plug in for the known variable in either original equation, then solve for the other unknown
			- Will usually get an [[ordered pair]] for the system in case with 1 solution
		- Check the result: plug in for x and y in both original equations
	- Graphing very inefficient
	- For substitution, a variable with a coefficient of 1 or -1 will make it easier
	- You can solve for any variable in any equation to start. Then you plug-in variable in other equation
	- [[No solution]]
		- When 2 lines are parallel
		- If variable drops out when doing this, you'll have a statement that doesn't make sense (like $-\frac {2}{3})$
		- If you solve each equation for y. If each in [[slope-intercept form]], you can see they each have the same slope but different y-intercepts so they're parallel lines
	- [[Infinitely many solutions]]
		- When variable drops out and you have a true statement (1=1)
