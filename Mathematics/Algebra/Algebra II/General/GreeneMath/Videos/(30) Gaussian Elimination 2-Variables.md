	- Solving Linear systems in two variables using matrix methods
	- A [[matrix]] is an ordered array of numbers
	- A matrix is named according to the number of rows and columns in contains
	- A [[square matrix]] has the same number of rows as columns
	- Start with an [[augmented matrix]]: a vertical bar will separate the [[coefficients]] from the [[constants]]
		- To get a solution for x and y, we need to do elementary row operations
			- We can manipulate our matrix using row operations. These produce matrices that lead to linear systems with the same solution set as the original system
	- [[Row Operations]]
		- (1) We can interchange any two rows
		- (2) We can multiply any row by a non-zero number
		- (3) We can multiply a row by a real number and add this to the corresponding elements of any other row
			- Similar principles to the elimination method
	- [[row echelon form]]
		- $\left[\begin{array}{rr|r} 1 & a & b \\ 0 & 1 & c\end{array}\right]$
			- 1s down diagonal
			- 0 below
			- Real numbers a, b, and c

	- [[reduced row echelon form]] (generally a little quicker since we don't need to go back and plug things in)
		- $\left[\begin{array}{rr|r} 1 & 0 & a \\ 0 & 1 & b\end{array}\right]$
			- We have solution in this form without needing to go back and plug things in
	- Reduced echelon form in bottom example
