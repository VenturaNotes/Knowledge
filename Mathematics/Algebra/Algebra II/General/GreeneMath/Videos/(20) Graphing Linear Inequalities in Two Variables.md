	- [[Solution region]]: any (x, y) that satisfies the inequality
	- [[non-solution region]]: any (x, y) that does not satisfy the inequality
	- [[Boundary Line]]: a line that separates the solution region from the non-solution region
		- > or < strict: boundary line not part of solution
			- dashed line
		- $\ge$ or $\le$ non-strict: boundary line is part of the solution
			- solid line
	- Graphing a Linear Inequality in two variables
		- Replace the inequality symbol with an equality symbol, then graph the resulting line
		- Choose a test point - any (x, y) that is not on the line
		- Shade the solution region
	- Can solve by finding points or solving in [[slope-intercept form]]
