	- Special case scenarios
		- No solution
		- Infinite number of solutions
	- The two lines intersect at one and only one point
		- System is [[consistent]] and the equations are [[independent]]
	- The graphs do not intersect. These are parallel lines and there is no solution
		- This system is [[inconsistent]]
	- The graphs are the same line. In this situation, there are an infinite number of solutions
		- The equations are said to be [[dependent]]
