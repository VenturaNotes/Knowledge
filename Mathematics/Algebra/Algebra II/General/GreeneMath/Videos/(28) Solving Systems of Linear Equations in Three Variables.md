	- [[Ordered triple]]: (x, y, z)
		- $ax + by + cz = k$
	- A [[linear equation]] in 2 and 3 variables will have an infinite number of solutions
	- Solving a Linear System in three variables
		- Write as: $ab + by + cz = x$
		- Use elimination to eliminate one of the variables from any two equations
		- Eliminate the same variable from any other two equations
		- Solve the linear system in two variables, use the result to find the third unknown
		- Check the result in each equation: plug in for each x, y, and z in each original equation
	- Solving by substitution is possible but super tedious. That's why elimination is more taught for these kind of problems
