	- The rectangle represents the whole universe
	- A prime (A') or A compliment ($A^c$ ) 
		- This contains all elements or members of set U that are not elements or members of set A.
	- A $\cup$ B is the set of all elements of A and all elements of B which is its union
		- A $\cup$ B  = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
			- No repeated elements
	- A $\cap$ B = {3}
		- Intersection between A and B
			- Only shows the elements that they have in common

	- A $\cap$ B = {n}
	- $A^c$ = {t, q, a, b, c, d}
	- $B^c$ = {a, b, c, g, h , d}

		- There is no overlap in A $\cap$ C. These two sets are called disjoint sets. They have no elements in common
