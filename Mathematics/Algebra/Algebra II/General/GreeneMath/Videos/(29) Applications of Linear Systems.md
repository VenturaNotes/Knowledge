	- Solving applications of linear systems
		- Read the problem and determine the main objective
		- Assign a variable to represent each unknown
		- Write a system of equations
		- Solve the system and check
	- For every unknown we have, we need to have an equation
		- 2 unknowns means 2 equations needed
	- Make sure answer is reasonable (no negative distance)
	- Problem #1
		- Beth's school is selling tickets to a fall musical. On the first day of ticket sales, the school sold 12 senior tickets and 16 child tickets for a total of $336. The school took in $312 on the second day by selling 15 senior tickets and 11 child tickets. Find the price of a senior ticket and the price of a child ticket
			- Set up 2 equations and used substitution
			- Used substitution
	- Problem #2
		- [[Distance]] = [[rate]] $\times$ [[time]]

	- Problem #3
		- James won $86,000 in the local lottery. He decided to invest the whole amount in three different investment funds. One in [[REIT]] pays 6% annual [[simple interest]]. The others, a [[C.D.]] and a [[bond fund]] pay 2% and 3% respectively
		- The total in annual simple interest from the three investments was $3900. The annual simple interest earned from the REIT was $900 less than three times the amount earned from the bond fund and the C.D. Find how much was invested in each.
			- [[Simple interest]] formula
				- $I = Prt$
