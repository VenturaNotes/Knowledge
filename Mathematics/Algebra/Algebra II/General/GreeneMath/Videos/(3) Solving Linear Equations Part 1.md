- Solving Linear Equations in one variable
- A linear equation in one variable: ax + b = c
	- a, b, and c represent real numbers
		- a $\ne$ 0
			- Need this restriction. Otherwise, you would not have a linear equation of variables
	- The variable x is raised to the first power
		- Referred to this as a first degree equation
		- Examples

	- The solution to an equation is a number (or more than one number) when it replaces the variable (or more than 1 variables) that it gives you a true statement
	- If you have the same value on the left as on the right, you have the correct answer
	- If you check x = 4, you'll find the solution to be false
- Addition Property of Equality:
	- We can add the same value to both sides of an equation and we will not affect the solution

		- Adds -4 to both sides of the equation
- Multiplication Property of Equality
	- Tells us that we can multiply both sides of an equation by the same nonzero number and we will not affect the solution. It has to be a nonzero value
	- Given 2x + 3 = 9 and solution is x=3

- Solving a Linear Equation in one Variable:
	- 1) Simplify each side separately
		- Combine parenthesis and like terms
	- 2) Isolate the variable terms on one side of the equation
		- Will be using additional property of equality
	- 3) Isolate the variable
		- Multiplication property of equality
	- 4) Check the solution in the original equation
- Let's take a look at some practice problems:

		- Using the distributive property first
		- Solution set notation
			- Elements are solutions to our equation
		- Check the solution
