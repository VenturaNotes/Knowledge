	- A [[relation]] is a set of ordered pairs.
	- Example
		- A grocery store cashier is paid $12 per hour worked. The amount earned each week is based or dependent on how many hours they work:
			- x is the input
				- Domain is set of x-values (or first component)
			- y is the output
				- Range is set of y-values (or second component)
	- Example 2
		- Suppose you drive at a constant rate of 75mph. The distance you travel is dependent on time.
			- [[Distance formula]]

	- A [[function (math)|function]] is a special type of relation. Each member of the domain must correspond to exactly one member of the range.
		- All functions are relations
		- Not all relations are functions
