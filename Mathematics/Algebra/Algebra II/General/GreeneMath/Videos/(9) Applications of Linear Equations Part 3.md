	- An alcohol solution was made[[(8) Applications of Linear Equations Part 2|]]
	- Example 1
		- An alcohol solution was made by mixing 3 gallons of an 80% alcohol solution and 4 gallons of a 52% alcohol solution. Find the concentration of the new mixture.
			- $\text{concentration of the substance} = \frac {\text{pure amount of the substance}} {\text{total amount of the mixture}}$
	- Example 2
		- Jennifer asked you to make 12 gallons of fruit punch that contains 48% fruit juice by mixing together Betty's Fruit Juice and Calvin's Fruit Juice. Betty's Fruit Juice is 38% fruit juice, while Calvin's Fruit Juice is 53% fruit juice. How many gallons of each are needed?
