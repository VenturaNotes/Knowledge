	- Solving linear systems in there variables using matrix methods
	- [[row echelon form]]
	- [[reduced row echelon form]]
		- 1s down diagonal and 0 above and below
	- Row operations
		- (1) We can interchange any two rows
		- (2) We can multiply any row by a non-zero number
		- (3) We can multiply a row by a real number and add this to the corresponding elements of any other row
	- When you end with a nonsensical statement such as 18 = 23 is false
		- Second example is an [[inconsistent system]] (meaning no solution)
