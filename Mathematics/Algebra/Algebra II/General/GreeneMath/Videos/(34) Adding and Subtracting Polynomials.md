	- [[Term]]: A number, variable, or the product of a number and one or more variables raised to powers
		- We separate terms with plus or minus symbols
	- A [[polynomial]] is either a single term or a finite sum of terms where all variables have whole number exponents and there are no variables in any denominator
	- [[Rational expression]]
		- $\frac {3x^2 - 1}{2x -5}$
	- [[Monomial]] - polynomial with one term only
	- [[binomial]] - polynomial with two terms only

	- [[trinomial]] - a polynomial with only three terms
	- A [[polynomial]] is written in standard form when the powers are in descending order
	- The [[degree]] of a term in a polynomial is the sum of the exponents on the variables of the term

	- The greatest [[degree]] of any term in the polynomial is known as the degree of the polynomial
	- In general, a [[constant]] has a degree is 0 unless it's the number 0 itself
	- [[like terms]]
		- Have the same variable or could be variables. Raised to same power or powers. [[Coefficients]] don't matter

	- If you have a variable by itself, the coefficient is 1
