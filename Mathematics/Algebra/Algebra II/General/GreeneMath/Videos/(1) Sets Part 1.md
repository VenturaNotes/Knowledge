- A set is a collection of things
	- It should be clear whether something belongs to the set or not
- {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
	- Members or elements of the set
	- -5 is not a member of the set of whole numbers
	- They are enclosed in a set of braces {}
	- [[Roster Method|Roster Method]] ^a82492
		- Listing the members or elements of the set inside of "set braces"
- {...,-2,-1,0,1,2,...}
	- This is the set of integers
	- 3 dots are known as an ellipses and tells you that a pattern continues
		- Continuing to the left is -3, -4, -5 etc.
		- Same to the right, 3,4,5
	- 3.41 would not be part of this set
- We can have sets that don't involve numbers
	- {a,b,c,d,e}
		- We can have the first 5 letters of the alphabet inside the set braces
- The order that we list the elements of a set is not important
	- {1,6,7} = {6,7,1} = {1,7,6}
	- Order does not matter. Elements or members matter
- States that border Louisiana
	- {Mississippi, Arkansas, Texas} = {Texas, Mississippi, Arkansas}
		- This is the set whose elements are the states that border Louisiana
		- What's important are the members or elements of the set
- We can use capital letters to name a set:
	- Let A be the set of whole numbers less than 4:
		- A = {0,1,2,3}
		- This is the set A
- A set that contains no elements is referred to as an "empty set" or "null set":

	- Solution set notation. A solution set is a set whose elements are a solution to your equation. Not that useful in algebra 2, but good for higher level maths. Helps when you have many solutions
	- $\varnothing$  
		- Use this symbol to show an equation with no solution
	- {}
		- You can also use set braces with nothing inside
	- {$\varnothing$} (WRONG!)
		- This is the set that contains 1 element (which is the empty set)
		- The above is wrong
- B = $\varnothing$ 
	- This is the set of pigs that have been to Saturn
- B = {}
	- This is valid as well
- The symbol "$\in$" is used to denote "is a member of the set":
- Z = {3,7,1,8}
	- 3 $\in$ 2
	- 7 $\in$ 2
	- 1 $\in$ 2
		- Read as "1 is an element of set Z"
	- 8 $\in$ 2
- The symbol "$\notin$" is used to denote "is not a member of the set":

- The universal set U is a set that contains all elements under consideration
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 11.39.39 PM.png]]
		- A represents the states that border Louisiana
		- The universal set is all the states of the United States (in alphabetical order)
			- All elements under consideration would be every state in the U.S.

	- First set represents all living presidents
	- Second set represents all presidents ever in the United State  (in alphabetical order)
- Additionally, we have finite sets, which have a specific number of elements and infinite sets, which have an unlimited number of elements.
	- A = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
		- These are the whole numbers less than 6.
- Let's take a look at subsets:
	- A = {1,7,3}
		- A is a proper subset of B because B contains all elements of A and they are not equal to each other.
			- A $\subset$ B
		- A has 1, 7 and 3, which B has
	- B = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
- If 2 sets are equal meaning they have exactly the same elements, they're known as improper subsets of each other.
	- The two sets are equal to each other because they have the same elements
		- G = {1, 8, 2}
		- D = {2, 1, 8}
	- They are improper subsets of each other.
	- G $\subseteq$ D
		- G is an improper subset of D
	- D $\subseteq$ G
		- D is an improper subset of G
- We use the symbol "$\not\subset$" to denote "is not a subset of":
	- It's just a subset symbol with a line drawn through it
- Q = {a, m, n, o}
- L = {a, d, z, p, o, n}

- Lastly, let's discuss how many subsets can be made from a given set: $2^n$ (where n is the number of elements)
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 11.53.20 PM.png|400]]
		- The empty set is a subset of all sets. (choosing nothing)
			- You have to think of subsets as possible choices from the set.
