	- [[Slope]] is the ratio of vertical change ("rise") to horizontal change ("run")
	- To calculate the slope of a line when two points are known:
		- m stands for slope

	- Let's take a look at: 3x - 2y = -6
		- Just found the x and y intercepts for the points
	- On a horizontal line, right is increasing and left is decreasing
	- On a vertical line, up is increasing and down is decreasing

	- The slope of any horizontal line is always zero:
		- y = 3
	- The slope of a vertical line is undefined
		- x = -4

	- A positively sloped line rises as we move to the right
		- As x increases, y increases
	- A negatively sloped line falls as we move right
		- As x increases, y decreases
	- Slope can be found directly from the equation of the line
		- y = mx + b
