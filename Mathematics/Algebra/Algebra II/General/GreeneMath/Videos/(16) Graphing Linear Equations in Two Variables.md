	- x-intercept is where the graph crosses the x-axis
		- plug in a 0 for y and solve for x
	- The [[intercept method]]

	- We often see equations whose x and y intercept occurs at the origin (0, 0): 
		- ax + by = c

	- Graphing vertical and horizontal lines
		- We will see equations such as
			- y = k

	- Additionally we see vertical lines
		- x = k
