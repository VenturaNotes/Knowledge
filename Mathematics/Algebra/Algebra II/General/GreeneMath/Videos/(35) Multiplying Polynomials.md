	- We can multiply any two terms together using our [[commutative property]] and [[associative property]]
	- Commutative property tells us that we can multiply in any order
	- Associative property tells us the grouping doesn't matter when we multiply
	- When we multiply two polynomials together, we use our [[distributive property]]
	- When reading $2x^2(3x + 4y)$, you say
		- $2x^3$ times the quantity 3x + 4y
