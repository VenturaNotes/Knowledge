	- For [[elimination method|elimination]], we want to use this when we have one-pair of variable terms as [[opposites]]
	- Solving Linear Systems in two Variables with Elimination
		- Place both equations in [[standard form]]: ax + by = c
			- a, b, and c are real numbers.
			- a and b are both not 0
		- Transform one or both equations in a way that one pair of variable terms are opposites
		- Add the left sides and set this equal to the sum of the right sides
		- Solve the resulting equation and find the other unknown using substitution
		- Check the result: plug in for x ad y in both original equations

	- When the variables are eliminated
		- the statement is true - [[infinitely many solutions]]
			- Same line
		- the statement is false - [[no solution]]
			- Parallel lines
