	- Instructions
		- Graph the Parabola
	- A parabola is a u shaped graph that can be opened up or down (or left and right)
	- If a parabola opens up, it's vertex is its minimum point (positive $x^2$ term)
	- If a parabola opens down, it's vertex is its maximum point (negative $x^2$ term)
	- We could just plot different points to get a good picture of the graph but there is a more efficient method
	- Efficient method
		- Find where the point intercepts the y-axis
		- Find vertex in axis of symmetry (line about which the parabola is symmetric. Goes through the vertex right through the middle of the parabola)
			- Distance between 2 points with the same y point will be half that distance from the axis of symmetry
		- Complete the square to find the vertex
			- Alternate method is [[(4) Algebra - Ch. 8 - Solving Quad. Eqn. with Factoring (4 of 21) General Form of the Quadratic Equation|x-coordinate of the vertex formula]] ($\frac {-b}{2a}$)
	- Terms
		- Y-intercept
		- Completing the Square
		- Axis of symmetry
