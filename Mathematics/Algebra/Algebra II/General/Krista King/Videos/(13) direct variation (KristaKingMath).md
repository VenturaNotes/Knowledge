	- Instruction
		- If the number of teachers varies directly by the number of students, and there are 5 teachers for 150 students, how many teachers will there be when there are 300 students?
	- Can be called "direct proportion" or "direct ratio"
	- Direct variation
		- Both will increase or decrease together
		- $x = ky$
			- k is a constant which describes the relationship between x and y
			- k is the relationship
			- x and y are the 2 variables that relate to one another directly
	- Recommended to write a key for yourself
		- Common to solve for k (the relationship between the directly related variables)
