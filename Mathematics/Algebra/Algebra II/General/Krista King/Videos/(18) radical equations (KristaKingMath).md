	- Instruction
		- Solve for x
	- Always trying to isolate radical in equation (on own side of equation)
		- Trying to square a square root
	- Always need to double check your solutions when solving radical equations after squaring it
	- Use the Zero theorem to solve for x
		- Given pq = 0
			- p = 0 and/or q = 0
				- Because the only way for the equation to be true is for at least one of the variables to equal 0.
