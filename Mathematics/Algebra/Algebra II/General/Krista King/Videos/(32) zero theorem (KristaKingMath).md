	- Use the zero theorem to find solutions to a quadratic equation
	- Write terms of equation in descending order of degrees
	- Zero theorem
		- $p*q = 0$ 
			- We know that p= 0 and/or q = 0
			- This is the only way for the above equation to be true.
			- We can use it to find solution to equation.
