	- Instruction
		- The number of mice in a forest is inversely proportional to the number of owls. If there are 300 mice when there are 30 owls, find the number of mice when the owl population is 60.
	- Inverse Variation Formula
		- When 1 variable increases, the other decreases
		- $x = \frac ky$
			- k is the constant
			- x and y are the variables inversely related
		- Other equivalent variations of formula
			- $A = \frac kB$
			- $m = \frac kn$
	- Called inverse proportion or inverse ratio
	- Can change assignment of variables to get the same answer
