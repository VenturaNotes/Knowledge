	- Instructions
		- Solve the System of Equations
	- You need at least as many equations as variables to solve the system
		- If you have 3 variables but only 2 equations, you won't be able to solve for the solution
	- Start with $x=2y$ since it is the simplest. Plug it into the other 2 equations
	- Turn the system into 2 equations with 2 variables
