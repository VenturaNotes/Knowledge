	- Currently have $500 earning 4%, how much interest will you earn in 2 years?
	- How much will you have in total?
	- Currently have $140 earning 57, how much is in the account in 6 years? 
- When we say simple interest, we mean interest that is not compounded.
- Compound interest is when you earn interest from $500 to $510 and then earn interest on $510.
- Simple interest means you only earn interest on the original principal amount.
	- Will continue earning interest on the baseline amount. Not the $510
- Formula
	- I = Prt
		- I = Interest 
		- P = Principal amount
			- Amount in account we start with
		- r = rate
			- Interest rate
			- Given to us as a percentage (but we need to express as a decimal number)
			- Think of it as annual percentage rate (rate per year)
			- has a unit of years
		- t = time
			- time in years
			- Has a unit of years
	- A = P + I
		- A is total amount
		- P is principal
		- I is interest
- Able to make the formula $A = P(1 + rt)$
