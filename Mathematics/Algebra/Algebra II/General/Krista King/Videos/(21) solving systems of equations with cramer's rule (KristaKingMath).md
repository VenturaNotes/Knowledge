	- Instruction
		- Use Cramer's rule to solve the system
	- Other methods
		- Substitution
		- Elimination
		- Graphing
	- Cramer's rule
		- Find the determinants of a few matrices in order to solve for the values of x and y
		- Coefficients of variables are important and constant values (solution values)
	- Coefficient matrix is first matrix
		- Take upper left value and multiply it by lower right value
		- Then subtract product of lower left and upper right values
	- Helps to set up all matrices at once
	- To solve for x
		- $x = \frac {D_x}D = -2$
	- To solve for y
		- $y = \frac {D_y}D = -2$
