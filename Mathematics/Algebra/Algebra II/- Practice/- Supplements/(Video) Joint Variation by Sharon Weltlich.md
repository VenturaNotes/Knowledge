	- [[Joint variation]] describes a situation where one variable depends on two (or more) other variables, and varies directly with each of them when the others are held constant.
	- We say z varies jointly as x and y if $z=kxy$ for some constant k
	- Remember: Direct variation - y varies directly as x if there is some constant k such that $y=kx$ 
		- k is called the constant of variation
		- y is a multiple of x
	- Joint variation
		- z varies jointly as x and y if there is some number k such that $z=kxy$, where x $\ne$ 0 and y $\ne$ 0

	- Practice problems
		- z varies jointly with x and y when z=12, x=3, and y=20. Can you determine the constant of variation
