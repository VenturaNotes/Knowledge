		- You could break up the variables either through the product rule or the power rule for the left expression
		- Need to write the absolute value signs around the variables to indicate that it will be positive when the root and power is even
- Examples 7 and 8

		- The negative sign is just a scalar in example 7
		- I don't know why he keeps forgetting his absolute value signs around
