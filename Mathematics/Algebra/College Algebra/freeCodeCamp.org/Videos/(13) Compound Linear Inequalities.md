	- Solving linear inequalities (involves variable but no $x^2$ or any other higher powered terms)
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-21 at 5.26.51 AM.png|500]]
	- If you multiply or divide an inequality by a negative number, then you need to reverse the inequality
	- Open circle is when x is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">strictly</mark> less than 3

	- This is an example of a compound inequality. It has 2 parts and you want to find the values of x that satisfy either one.

	- Writing interval notation where both linear inequalities are true (and)

	- Using an "and" statement

	- Solved linear inequalities including compound inequalities joined by conjunctions "and" and "or"
		- And
			- Looking for places on the number line where both statements are true
			- Overlap on number line
		- Or
			- Looking for places where either one or the other statement is true (or both)
