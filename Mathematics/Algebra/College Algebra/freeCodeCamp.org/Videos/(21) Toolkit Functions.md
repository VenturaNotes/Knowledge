	- [[Graphs of common functions]]
	- Graphs of commonly used functions
		- $y=x$
			- [[Line]]
		- $y=x^2$
			- [[Parabola]]
			- EVen function
				- It has mirror symmetry across the y-axis
			- When you square a positive number, you will get the same number when squaring its opposite
		- $y=x^3$
			- [[Cubic]]
			- Odd function it has 180$\degree$ rotational symmetry around the origin
				- If you turn the paper upside down, you'll get the same shape
				- The opposite of the positive number will just have the negative number when cubed
		- $y=\sqrt{x}$
			- [[Square root function]]
			- Domain is $x \ge 0$
			- Can't take the square root of a negative number
		- $y=|x|$
			- [[Absolute Value Function]]
			- Even or mirror symmetry
		- $y=2^x$
			- [[Exponential Function]]
				- Represents exponential growth
			- Bigger base makes the number rise a little more steeply
		- $y=\frac1x$
			- [[Hyperbola]]
			- Not defined when x=0
			- Odd function
				- Has 180 degree symmetry
				- If you turn the page upside down, it'll look exactly the same
		- $y=\frac{1}{x^2}$
			- Even function
				- Has perfect mirror symmetry across the y-axis
