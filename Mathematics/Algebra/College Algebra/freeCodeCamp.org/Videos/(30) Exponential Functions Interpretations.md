	- Example. An antique car is worth $50,000 now and its value increases by 7% each year. Write an equation to model its value x years from now
		- Initial value and growth factor (exponential equation)
	- Example. My Toyota Prius is worth $3,000 now and its value decreases by 5% each year. Write an equation to model its value x years in the future

	- Example. The number of bacteria in a petri dish is modeled by the equation f(x) where f(x) represents the number of bacteria in thousands, and x represents the number of hours since noon.
		- What was the number of bacteria at noon?
		- By what percent is the number of bacteria increasing every hour?
	- A is the initial value
	- b is the growth factor
	- r is the rate of increase

	- Example. The population of salamanders s(x) on an island is modeled by s(x) where x is the number of years since 2015.
		- What was the population in 2015?
		- By what percent is the population decreasing every year?

	- Exponential function forms
		- When increasing quantity
		- When decreasing quantity
	- r is the % increase (or decrease) written as a decimal
