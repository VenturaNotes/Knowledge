- Intro
	- Exponential functions and their graphs

	- Definition. An exponential function is a function that can be written in the form $f(x) a*b^x$ where a and b are real numbers, a $\ne$ 0, and b > 0
		- The variable x is in the exponent
		- A variable in the base is not an exponential fn
	- Note. We require that $a \ne$ 0 because otherwise you'd have a constant function
	- Note. We require that b > 0 because we can't use any negative bases (not a real number) or 0 bases (constant function) for an exponential function
	- The number a is called the initial value
		- It's called the initial value because when x = 0, we get f(0) = a
	- and the number b is called the base

	- Graph the function $y=a*b^x$ for different values of a and b
		- When increasing the a value, the y-intercept changes (function stretched out)
		- When decreasing the a value, the initial value becomes negative and the graph flips across the x-axis.
		- When increasing the b value, y-intercept stays at 1 but the graph becomes steeper and steeper
		- When decreasing the value of b, when b = 1, the graph is completely flat (just a constant). When b = a fractional number, graph starts to slope the other way (decreasing now instead of increasing), but the y-intercept still hasn't changed
		- When b goes to negative territory, the graph doesn't make any sense
	- Takeaways
		- a changes the y-intercept
		- b changes the steepness of the graph when it's increasing for b values greater than 1 and decreasing for values of b less than 1

	- Fact. In the graph of $y = a*b^x$
		- The parameter <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a</mark> gives the y-intercept
		- The parameter <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">b</mark> tells how the graph is increasing or decreasing
		- If b > 1, the graph is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">increasing</mark>
		- If b < 1, the graph is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">decreasing</mark>
		- The closer b is to the number <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">1</mark> , the flatter the graph
	- So for example, the graph of $y=0.25^x$ is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">more steep</mark> than the graph of $y=0.4^x$.
	- Fact. The graph of an exponential function $y= a*b^x$
		- has a horizontal asymptote at the line <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">y=0</mark>
		- has domain <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">(-infinity, infinity)</mark>
		- has range
			- If a > 0, (0, infinity)
			- If a < 0, (-infinity, 0)
	- Note
		- The most famous exponential function in the world is $f(x) = e^x$. This function is sometimes written as $f(x) = exp(x)$. The number $e$ is Euler's number, and is approximately 2.71828182845904523...
			- Important for calculus and compound interest problems

	- Looked at exponential functions (where the variable is in the exponent)
	- All have the same general shape 
	- If a is negative, the exponential function flips over the x axis (vertical direction)
	- All have a horizontal asymptote where y=0 (x-axis)
