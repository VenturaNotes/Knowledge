	- The exponent is sometimes called the power
	- If the exponent is "n", the base is multiplied by itself n times

	- (1) The Product Rule
		- When two expressions with the same base are multiplied -> add the exponents
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-19 at 10.08.01 PM.png]]
	- (2) The Quotient Rule
		- When dividing two expressions with the same base -> subtract the exponents

	- (3) The Power Rule
		- raise a power to a power -> multiply the exponents
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-19 at 10.11.47 PM.png]]
	- (4) Power of Zero
		- Anything to the 0th power is equal to 1 (with one exception: $0^0$ is undefined)
		- Works with the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">quotient rule</mark>

	- (5) Negative Exponents
		- Is consistent with the product rule

	- (6) Fractional Exponents
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-19 at 10.14.02 PM.png|500]]
	- (7) Distribute an Exponent over a product
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-19 at 10.19.07 PM.png|500]]
	- (8) Distribute an Exponent over a Quotient
		- Can distribute an exponent over multiplication and division
		- Cannot distribute an exponent over addition or subtraction
