- Intro
	- Solving Exponential Equations - Applications
		- Population growth and radioactive decay
		- Introduce ideas of half life and doubling time

	- Example. Suppose you invest $1600 in a bank account that earns 6.5% annual interest, compounded annually. How many years will it take until the account has $2000 in it, assuming you make no further deposits or withdrawals?

	- Example. A population of bacteria contains 1.5 million bacteria and is growing by 12% per day. What is the doubling time?
		- [[Doubling time]] means amount of time it takes for a quantity to double in size.
			- It also only depends on the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">growth rate</mark>, not the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">initial population</mark>
				- You don't even need to know what the initial population was
				- You can just represent the function and initial population as variables (A) as shown above

	- Example. Suppose a bacteria population doubles every 15 minutes. Write an equation for its growth using the exponential equation $y = a*b^t$ where t represents time in minutes. Assume the initial population is 350 bacteria.
	- Will always be able to find 2 different versions of an exponential equation
		- Standard one
			- Blue circled in red
		- Continuous growth one
			- Black circled in red

	- Example. The half life of radioactive Carbon-14 is 5750 years. A sample of bone that originally contained 200 grams of C-14 now contains only 40 grams. How old is the sample?
		- Half life
			- The amount of time it takes for a quantity to decrease to half as much
	- f(t) is the amount of radioactive C-14. "a" is the initial amount
	- If you used the general formula, you'd get this equation
		- $5750\left(\frac{ln\left(\frac{1}{5}\right)}{ln\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)}\right) = 13351.0865$

	- Learned continuous growth model 
		- Can be written as an exponential function
			- b is equivalent to $e^r$
	- Learned doubling time and half life
