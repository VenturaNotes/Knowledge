	- A quadratic equation is an equation that contains the square of a variable but no higher powers of "x"
	- Standard form of a quadratic equation
		- $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
			- Where a, b, c represent real numbers and a $\ne$ 0
	- Steps to quadratic equations
		- (1) Write in standard form
		- (2) Factor or use quadratic formula
	- Standard Form
		- $3x^2 + 7x - 2 = 0$
	- Not in standard form
		- $3x^2 = -7x + 2$

	- It's sometimes faster to factor than use the quadratic formula but you'll always get an answer using the quadratic formula
