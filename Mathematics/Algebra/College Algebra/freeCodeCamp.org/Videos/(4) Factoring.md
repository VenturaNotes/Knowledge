	- Factoring an expression means to rewrite it as a product
	- Factoring is the opposite of distributing out
	- Things we sum up are called the terms
	- If we think of same expression as product of things that are multiplied together, they're called factors

	- (1) Pull out the greatest common factor
		- GCF: the largest thing that divides each term
	- Check answer by multiplying out

	- (2) Factor by Grouping
		- Look for 4 terms
	- Sum of 2 squares does not factor any further?

	- (3) Factor quadratics
		- A quadratic is an expression with a squared term, a term with an x in it, and a constant term
	- 1st Problem
		- Find numbers that multiply to 3rd term and add to middle term
	- 2nd problem
		- Can use factoring by grouping
		- Find two numbers that multiply to -60 and add to 11
