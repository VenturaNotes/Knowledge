- Intro
	- Will talk about their domains

	- Graph y by plotting points
	- No power you can raise to, to get a negative number or 0
	- Key Points (this would all be true for $log_{10}x$ as well). Any $y=log_a(x)$ where a > 1 looks the same and has the 3 properties below
		- Domain
			- x > 0
			- (0, $\infty$)
		- Range
			- All real numbers
			- (-$\infty$, $\infty$ )
		- Vertical Asymptote at y-axis
			- This is at the line x=0
			- A vertical asymptote is a line that our function's graph gets closer and closer to.

	- Graph $y=ln(x) + 5$. Find the domain, range, and asymptotes.
		- The new equation just shift the line up 5 units

	- Graph $y = log(x+2)$. Find the domain, range, and asymptotes.
		- Shifts left by 2.

	- Find the domain
	- Using algebra to compute the domain
	- Whatever is inside the argument of the log function, it better be greater than 0
		- Then you just solve the inequality

	- Important to memorize the basic shape of the graph of a log function
	- It goes through the point (1,0) and has a vertical asymptote on the y-axis
	- Can't take the log of a negative number or 0 (this will help compute the domain of functions)
		- Whatever is inside the log function, set it greater than 0 and solve to find the domain
