	- When you have an equation with variables in the exponent, logs are the tool of choice for getting the variables down when you can solve for them.

	- Solve
	- (1) Isolate tricky part
	- (2) Take log of both sides (use $log_{10}$ or ln since those are on calculators)
	- (3) Use log rules to bring down exponents
	- (4) Distribute
	- (5) Moved x terms on one side, terms without x's on other side
	- (6) Isolate x by factoring it out and dividing.

	- Solve
	- (1) Isolate tricky parts
	- (2) Take log of both sides
	- (3) Use log rules to bring down the exponents
	- (4) Distribute
	- (5) Group x terms on one side, other terms on on other side
	- (6) Isolate x by factoring it out and dividing

	- Solve
	- (1) Isolate tricky parts / simplify
	- (2) Take ln of both sides
	- (3) Use log rules to ultimately bring down exponents
	- (4) Distribute (not needed)
	- (5) Bring terms with t to one side, terms without t to other side
	- (6) Isolate "t" by factoring out "t" & dividing
- Summary
	- Gives examples for solving equations with variables in the exponent
	- Key idea
		- Take log of both sides
		- Use log properties to bring the exponents down
