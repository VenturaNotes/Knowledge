	- The rate of travel is the distance travel divided by the time it takes to travel.
	- Distance = rate times time
	- Rates add
		- With respect to something stationary
		- First rate + second rate = total rate

	- Example. Elsa's boat has a top speed of 6 miles per hour in still water. While traveling on a river at top speed, she went 10 miles upstream in the same amount of time she went 30 miles downstream. Find the rate of the river current.
	- Can use a chart to help solve the problem
	- Could solve for the time by plugging in the rate found into one of the equations

	- Charted out information
		- Rates add to fill in some boxes
		- Used formula of $distance = rate \times time$ to build a system of equations
