- Intro
	- Exponential functions can be used to model compound interest for loans and bank accounts

	- Example. Suppose you invest $200 in a bank account that earns 3% interest every year. If you make no deposits or withdrawals, how much money will you have after 10 years?
	- Invest "A" dollars at an annual interest rate of "r" for "t" years
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">interest accumulates once per year in this example</mark>

	- Example. You deposit $300 in an account that earns 4.5% annual interest compounded semi-annually. How much money will you have 7 years? 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">This annual interest is compounded semi-annually.</mark>

	- Example. You take out a loan for $1,200 at an annual interest rate of 6%, compounded monthly. If you pay back the loan with interest as a lump sum, how much will you owe after 3 years?
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">annual interest compounded monthly</mark>

	- You invest $4000 in an account that gives 2.5% interest compounded continuously. How much money will you have after 5 years?
	- Continuous compounding as the limit of compounding more and more frequently (100, 1000, 1 million times a year) in the limit, you get continuous compounding.
	- Representations
		- P(t) = Money
		- A = initial mount
		- r = annual interest rate written as a decimal
		- e = Represent's Euler's constant

	- Summary
		- Let r represent the annual interest rate, written as a decimal
		- Let t represent the number of years
		- Let A represent the initial amount of money
		- Annual Interest
		- Compound Interest, compounded n times per year
		- Compound interest, compounded continuously

	- Simple annual interest
	- Compound interest n times per year
	- Continuously compounded interest
