	- $\sqrt[x]{n}$
		- This notation means the $n^{th}$ root of x
	- 2 is implied for square root.

	- Rules for Radicals
	- For the last rule, think of "flower over root"
		- Flower is like "power" and root is like "root"
			- Good mnemonic
		- The m becomes the power and the n becomes the root

	- Example. Compute

	- Example. Simplify. (Assume all variables represent positive numbers.)
		- Simplify means to pull as much as possible out of radical sign
	- The denominator needs to be rationalized but in this example it's not

	- Rationalize the denominator. (Assume x represents a positive number).
		- Just means to rewrite without $\sqrt{}$ in the denominator
- Summary - Simplified radicals with
	- Fractional exponents
	- Pulling things out of radical
	- Rationalizing the denominator
