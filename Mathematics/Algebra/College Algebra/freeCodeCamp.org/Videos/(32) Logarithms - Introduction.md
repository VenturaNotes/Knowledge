	- Definition $log_ab = c$ means $a^c = b$ 
		- a is the base of the logarithm
		- Logarithm asks "what power do you raise a to, to get b?"
		- Read as
			- Log base a of b equals c
	- You can think of logarithms as exponents: $\log_ab$ is the exponent (or "power") that you have to raise a to, in order to get b. The number a is called the base of the logarithm. The base is required to be a positive number.
	- Example. Evaluate the following expressions by hand by rewriting them using exponents instead of logs:
		- We can get positive, negative, and 0 answers for our logarithmic expressions

	- Example. Evaluate the following expressions by hand by rewriting them using exponents instead of logs
	- Note. It is possible to take the log of numbers that are > 0 but not of numbers that are $\le$ 0. In other words, the domain of the function f(x) = $log_a(x)$ no matter what base you're using is: (0, $\infty$)
		- Otherwise, there DNE (does not exist)
	- Note.
		- $lnx$ means $log_ex$, and is called the natural log
		- log x, with no base, means $log_{10}x$ and is called the common log
		- You can find $lnx$ and $logx$ for various values of x using the buttons on your calculator

	- Example. Rewrite using exponents
	- Example. Rewrite the following using logs. Do not solve for any variables.
	- Could also rewrite base e as natural log
