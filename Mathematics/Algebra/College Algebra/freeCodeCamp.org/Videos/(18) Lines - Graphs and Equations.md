	- Find the equation of this line
		- Find the slope using the slope formula
		- Plug-in one of the points into the formula in slope-intercept form and find the value of b
	- m represents the slope
	- b represents the y-intercept
		- y value where the line crosses the y-axis
	- Slope = rise over run = change in y values over change in x values = y2 - y1 over x2 - x1
		- The $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2$) are points on the line
	- Convenient points to use would be integers

	- Find the equation of these lines
	- Vertical line equation
		- x = -2
	- Horizontal line equation
		- y = 3.5

	- Find the equation of the line through the points (1,2) and (4,-3)
	- Two methods
		- Using slope-intercept form
		- Using point-slope form
			- $(x_0,y_0)$ is a point on line
			- m is slope

	- Can find <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">equation for line</mark> if you know the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">slope and one point</mark>
	- Can find equation for line given <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">2 points</mark>
	- Slope -intercept form
		- m is slope
		- b is y-intercept
	- Point slope form
		- m is slope
		- $(x_0,y_0)$ is point on line
