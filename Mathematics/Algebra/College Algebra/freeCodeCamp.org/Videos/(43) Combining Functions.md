	- We can combine functions, such as f(x) = x + 1 and g(x) = $x^2$ in the following ways.
	- Add them together: (f+g)(x)=
		- The notation "f plus g of x" means the function defined by taking f(x) and adding it to g(x)
	- Subtract them: (f-g)(x)=
	- Multiply them: (f$\cdot$g)(x)
	- Divide them: $\frac fg (x)$
