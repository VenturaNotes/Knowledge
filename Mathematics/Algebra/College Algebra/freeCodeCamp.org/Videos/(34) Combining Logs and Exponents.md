	- Example. Evaluate
		- Use the calculator to solve the questions below
	- Buttons on calculator
		- Log base 10 is the log button
		- Log base e is the natural log button
	- In each case in the example problems
		- The log and the exponential function with the same base undo each other and we're left with the exponent
	- [[Log rule]]
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">An exponential function and a log function with the same base undo each other.</mark>
		- If you're familiar with the language of inverse functions, the exponential function and log function are inverses.

	- Examples
	- Last example is false because the bases are not the same
