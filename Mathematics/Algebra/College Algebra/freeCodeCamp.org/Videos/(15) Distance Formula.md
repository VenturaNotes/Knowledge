	- Distance formula can be used to find the distance between 2 points if we know their coordinates
	- Formula comes from pythagorean theorem
	- Distance is always positive

	- Find the distance between the points P(-1, 5) and Q(4,2).
	- Doesn't matter which points you label your $(x_1,y_1)$ 
- Summary
	- There is a minus between the squared coordinates because we're looking for the difference of the coordinates to find the lengths of the sides
