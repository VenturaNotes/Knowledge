	- A function that can be written in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
		- where a, b, and c are real numbers
		- and a $\ne$ 0
			- Otherwise, it would be a [[linear function]]
		- $x^2$ term is the hallmark of a quadratic function

	- Which of these equations represent quadratic functions?
	- It's ok for b and c to equal 0
	- First equation is in [[standard form]]
	- Last equation is in [[vertex form]]
