	- (1) Find LCD
	- (2) Clear the denominator
	- (3) Simplify & solve
	- (4) Plug in to check answer (more important for rational equations. Can't have denominator = 0)
		- Might get extraneous solutions that don't work in original equation because of the denominator equaling 0

	- Method 1
		- (1) Find LCD
		- (2) Clear denominator
	- Method 2
		- (1) Find LCD
		- (2) Write all rational expressions over that LCD
		- (3) Set numerators equal
	- Warning
		- Check for extraneous solutions
			- Solutions that make your denominators equal 0
