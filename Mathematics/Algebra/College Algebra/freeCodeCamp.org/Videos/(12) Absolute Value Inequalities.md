	- What x-values satisfy
	- It was written in inequality notation and standard notation
	- Also a number line was used to help

	- Think about distance when solving absolute value inequalities
	- An absolute value sign that is less than a number will be close to 0
	- An absolute value sign greater than a number will be far away from 0 (because its distance from 0 is bigger than a certain number)
	- Drawing picture on number line can be useful
