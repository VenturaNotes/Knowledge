	- Equations that have square roots or cube roots or any other kind of radical in them
-  ![[Screenshot 2023-02-20 at 9.18.52 PM.png]]
	- Find all real solutions for the equation
	- (1) Isolate the square root term
	- (2) Get rid of square root by squaring both sides
	- (3) Solve (perhaps factoring)
	- (4) Check solution and eliminate extraneous solutions
		- Extraneous solutions don't satisfy our original equation

	- Find all real solutions for the equation
	- (1) Isolate the part of equation that involves the fractional exponent
	- (2) Get rid of the fractional exponent
		- Make sure to include the $\pm$ sign when taking an even root. 
			- If it's an odd root, you don't need to do $\pm$ 
		- It is possible to raise the entire term to $\frac 54$ since in 1 swoop you would cancel it all out
	- (3) Solve using exponent rule
	- (4) Check answer
- Summary
	- (1) Learned to isolate radical or fractional exponent
	- (2) Learned to remove radical or fractional exponent
