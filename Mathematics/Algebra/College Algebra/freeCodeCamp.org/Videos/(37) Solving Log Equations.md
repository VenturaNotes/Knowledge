	- Solve
	- (1) Isolate the tricky part
	- (2) Take e to the power of both sides
	- (3) Finish solving for x
	- (4) Check answers (may get extraneous solutions)

	- Solve
	- (1) Isolate the tricky part (can't do it here)
	- (2) Take 10 to the power of both sides
	- (3) Finish solving for x
	- (4) Check solutions
		- Log of a negative # does not exist
	- Could use log rules as well to solve
- Summary
	- Key step
		- Use exponential functions to undo the log
			- Take e to power of both sides to undo natural log
			- Take 10 to power of both sides to undo $log_{10}$
