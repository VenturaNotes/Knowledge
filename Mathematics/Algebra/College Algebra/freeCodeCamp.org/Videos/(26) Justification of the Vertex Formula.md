	- Vertex formula says x-coordinate = $\frac {-b}{2a}$
	- This video gives a justification from where this formula comes from

	- Find the x-intercepts and the vertex for $y=3x^2 + 7x - 5$
	- The x-coordinate is half the distance between the 2 points on the x-intercepts
	- Also the equation $\frac {-b}{2a}$ comes from the quadratic formula

	- Find the x-intercepts and vertex for $y=ax^2 + bx + c$
	- Even when there are no solutions, the vertex still has the x-coordinate $\frac {-b}{2a}$
- Summary
	- This was the justification of the vertex formula
