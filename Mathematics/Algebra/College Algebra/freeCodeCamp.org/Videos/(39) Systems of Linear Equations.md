	- Linear equation can be rewritten as $y=mx+b$. It doesn't have any x or y squares in it.
	- A system of linear equations is a collection of two or more linear equations
		- Example
			- 2x - y = 1
			- x + y = 5
	- A solution to a system of equations is an x value and a y value that satisfy both of the equations
		- Ordered pair (2,3) (which is x=2, y=3) is a solution to the system above because plugging them in will make the equations both true
		- The ordered pair (1, 4) does not work

	- Solve the systems of equations
		- Method 1: substitution
			- Isolate one variable using one equation and substitute it into other equation
		- Method 2: Elimination
			- Multiply each equation by a constant to make coefficients of one variable match
	- What the solutions graphically means (it's the point where both lines intersect)

	- Solve the system of equations
		- No solution because they have the same slope
	- A system with no solution is called an [[inconsistent system]]

	- Solve the System of equations
		- Second equation is just a constant multiple of the first equation
	- Dependent system of linear equations
		- Any x and y values will satisfy both equations
		- Infinitely many solutions (x,y)
	- The lines are just on top of each other so we'll see only 1 line

	- 2 Methods to solve systems of linear equations
		- Substitution
		- Elimination
	- Types of solutions
		- One solution
			- Lines intersect once
		- Inconsistent (no solutions)
			- Lines never intersect
		- Dependent (infinitely many solutions)
			- Line on top of one another
