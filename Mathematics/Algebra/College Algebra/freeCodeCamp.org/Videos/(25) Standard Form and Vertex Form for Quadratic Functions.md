	- Quadratic in standard form
		- $y = ax^2 + bx + c$
			- a, b, c $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$ 
			- a $\ne$ 0
	- Quadratic in vertex form
		- $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$
			- h and k are real numbers
			- a $\ne$ 0
		- The vertex is the ordered pair (h, k)
	- Will learn how to get to vertex form to standard form and vice  versa.

	- Example
		- Convert this quadratic function to standard form: $f(x) = -4(x-3)^2+1$
			- Just need to expand it out.
		- Convert this quadratic function to vertex form: $g(x) = 2x^2 + 8x + 6$
			- Use the x-coordinate to find this
			- The a is equivalent to the a in standard form
- Summary
	- You go from vertex form to standard form by distributing out.
	- You go from standard form to vertex form by finding the vertex by using the vertex formula
		- $\frac {-b}{2a}$
