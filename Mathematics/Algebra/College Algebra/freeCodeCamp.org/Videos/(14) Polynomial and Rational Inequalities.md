	- (1) Move all terms to one side, with 0 on other side
	- (2) Solve the equation
	- (3) Plot solutions to equation
		- You want to find the point on the number line where the solution is less than 0

	- (1) Move all terms to one side
	- (2) Solve equation
	- (3) Find where rational expression does not exist (DNE)
	- (4) Pull all these values on number line
	- Sometimes the negative and positive ranges may be adjacent to each other on the number line.
