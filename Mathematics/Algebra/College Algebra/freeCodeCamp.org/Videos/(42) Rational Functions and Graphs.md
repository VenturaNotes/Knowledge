	- A rational function is a function that can be written as a ratio or a quotient of 2 polynomials
	- $\frac 1x$ is also considered a rational function
		- You can think of 1 and x as very simple polynomials

	-  Example. The graph of the function h(x) is shown below.
		- How is the graph of this function h(x) different from the graph of a polynomial?
		- What is the end behavior of the graph?
			- To find end behavior, just look for terms in numerator and denominator with the highest exponent
				- This gives us the horizontal asymptote at y = 3
		- What is the behavior of the graph of this function h(x) near x =-5?
			- Vertical asymptote at x =-5
				- Only has this vertical asymptote because this is when the denominator is equal to 0. When x = 2, the (x-2) is factored out of the function so the simplified form of the function will not have a vertical asymptote there
		- What is going on at x =2?
			- Hole at x=2
				- To find the y value of the hole, just plug-in the x=2 into the simplified form of the function
	- A horizontal asymptote is a horizontal line that our graph gets closer and closer to as x goes to infinity or as x goes to negative infinity or both. (y=3)
		- Here, the end behavior is different
	- A hole is a place along the curve of a graph where the function does not exist
	- $3x^2$ dominates the numerator and $x^2$ dominates the denominator

	- For a rational function
		- Find the vertical asymptotes by ^45f9bc
			- Set denominator equal to 0
			- All other x-values where denominators = 0
		- Find the holes by
			- Set denominator equal to 0
			- hole -> x-values where numerator and denominator are both zero and those factors cancel out.
		- Find the horizontal asymptotes by
			- Look at highest power term in numerator and denominator
	- Example. What are the horizontal asymptotes for these functions?
		- (1) Since the denominator will get infinitely larger, it will go to 0
			- Degree of numerator < degree of denominator
		- (2) Horizontal asymptote equal to the ratio of the leading coefficients
			- Degree of numerator = degree of denominator
		- (3) Since the numerator will get infinitely larger, it will go to infinity so no horizontal asymptote
			- Degree of numerator > degree of denominator

	- Example. Find the vertical asymptotes, horizontal asymptotes, and holes:
	- x-intercept at x = -1
		- Corresponds where the numerator of our reduced rational function is equal to 0. A 0 in the numerator makes the whole function 0.
			- X-intercept is where the y-value of the whole function is 0.
