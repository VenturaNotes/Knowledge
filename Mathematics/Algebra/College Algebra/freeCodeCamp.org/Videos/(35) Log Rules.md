	- Note. Recall some of the exponent rules
		- "Zero Rule" [^1]
		- Product Rule
			- If we multiply two numbers with the same base, we add the exponents
		- Quotient Rule
			- If we divide two numbers with the same base, we subtract the exponents 
		- Power Rule
			- If we take a power to a power, we multiply the exponents.
	- Note. The exponent rules hold for any base, not just base 2.
	- The corresponding logarithm rules are:
		- Product Rule
			- The log of the product is the sum of the logs
		- Quotient Rule
			- The log of the quotient is the difference of the logs.
		- Power Rule 
			- When you take the log of an expression with an exponent, you can bring down the exponent and multiply
			- More traditional to multiply the "n" on the left side

	- The logarithm rules hold for any base, not just base 2.
		- Product rule
		- Quotient Rule
		- Power Rule

	- Example. Rewrite the following as a sum or difference of logs:
	- The power rule only applies to a single expression raised to an exponent (and not to the product with the warning sign in front of it)

	- Rewrite as a single log

	- (1) The log with any base of 1 is equal to 0
	- (2) The product rule
		- Sum of logs
	- (3) The quotient rule
		- Difference of logs
	- (4) The power rule
		- Bring down exponent and multiply the log
	- There is no log rule that helps split up log for sum
		- Also no rule for rewriting the sum of two exponential expressions
