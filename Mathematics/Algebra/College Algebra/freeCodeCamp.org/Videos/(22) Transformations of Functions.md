	- By changing the equation of a function, the graph of the function changes or transforms in predicable ways.
	- Rules and examples of transformations of functions
	- Typical functions
		- She calls them toolkit functions

	- Review of Function Notation
		- -2 is on outside of function
		- -2 is on inside of function
		- Multiply by 3 on inside of fn
		- Multiply by 3 on outside of fn
		- Negative sign on inside of fn
		- Add 17 on outside of fn
		- Add 12 on inside of fn
		- Multiply by -36 on outside of fn
		- Multiply by $\frac 14$ on the inside of fn
	- Rewrite the following, if g(x) = $\sqrt{x}$
		- Can say root quantity x
		- $\sqrt{-x}$ may be a real number since x could be negative itself
	- Rewrite the following in terms of g(x), if g(x) = $\sqrt{x}$

	- Graph
	- graphing $\sqrt{x}$ and two transformations of function
		- $y = \sqrt{x} -2$
			- Graph moves vertically down by 2 units
		- $y = \sqrt{x-2}$
			- graph moves horizontally to the right by 2 units

	- Rules for transformations
		- Numbers on the outside of the function affect the y-values and result in vertical motions. These motions are in the direction you expect.
		- Numbers on the inside of the function affect the x-values and result in horizontal motions. These motions go in the opposite direction from what you expect.
		- Adding results in a shift (translations)
		- Multiplying results in a stretch or shrink
		- A negative sign results in a reflection
			- If you start in $y=\sqrt{x}$, then when you do $y=\sqrt{-x}$, that's going to be a reflection in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">horizontal direction (means a reflection across the y-axis)</mark>
				- Because the negative is on the inside of the square root sign
			- $y=-\sqrt{x}$
				- This gives a vertical reflection across the x-axis (negative sign on the outside of the square root)

	- Example
		- Consider g(x) = $\sqrt{x}$. How do the graphs of the following functions compare to the graph of $y=\sqrt{x}$
	- Algebraically, a vertical shrink of $\frac 12$ is the same as a horizontal stretch by a factor of 4 at least for the square root function

	- Number on outside $\leftrightarrow$ y-values $\leftrightarrow$ vertical motions
		- $\leftrightarrow$ means <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">corresponds to</mark> changes in 
	- Numbers on inside of fn effects x-values and results in horizontal motions
	- Addition/subtraction corresponds to translations (shifts)
	- Multiplying/dividing corresponds to stretches and shrinks
	- Negative sign corresponds to reflection
		- Horizontal reflection (across y-axis) if negative sign on inside
		- Vertical reflection (across y-axis) if the negative sign is on the outside
	- Knowing these basic rules on transformations empowers you to be able to sketch graphs of much more complicated functions by simply considering the transformations
		- $y = 3\sqrt{x} + 2$
