	- Definition
		- A function is correspondence between input numbers (x-values) and output numbers (y-value) that sends each input number (x-value) to exactly one output number (y-value)
	- Can think of a machine as it takes an input value and produces one output number
		- You have person as input which goes through biological mother function and outputs their biological mother
			- Needs to be a biological mother
	- Sometimes, a function is described with an equation
	- What is f(2), f(5) and f(a+3)?
		- f(x) is function notation (NOT multiplication!)
			- We're putting in a value for x's input and getting out a value of f(x) or y
	- Use parentheses when evaluating fn (function) on expression

	- Sometimes, a function is described with a graph
	- Must pass the vertical line test
	- g(5)
		- It's undefined or does not exist because there is no existing value there for y=g(x)
	- The question of what x-values and y-values makes sense for a function leads us to a discussion of domain and range

	- The domain of a function is all possible x-values. The range is the y-values.
		- Values that make sense for that function
	- Example
		- What is the domain and range of the function g(x) graphed below?
	- To find the x-values in the domain, we have to look at the x-values that correspond to points on the graph. One way to do that is to take the shadow or projection of the graph onto the x-axis and see what x-values are hit. Looks like we're hitting all x-values starting at -8 and hitting up to 4. This is our domain

	- What are the domains of these functions?
	- To find domain:
		- (1) Exclude x-values that make denominator 0
		- (2) Exclude x-values that make an expression inside a $\sqrt{}$ negative
			- Need to exclude values that make any even root negative
			- But we can take an odd root (or cube root) of a negative number
		- Logarithmic functions will have additional exclusions

	- Has both square root and denominator in equation

	- Functions, how to evaluate them, and how to find domains and ranges
