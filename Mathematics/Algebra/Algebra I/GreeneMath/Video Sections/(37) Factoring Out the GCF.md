	- Will learn how to write a polynomial as a product
		- This process is known as factoring which is reversing the distributive property
	- [[Factoring]] is essentially the opposite of the distributive property. We are pulling out what's common to all terms and placing it outside of parentheses

	- Sometimes it is convenient to pull out a - 1. The result is not the true [[Greatest Common Divisor|GCF]], but it is a common practice
	- In $(-20v^5-15)$, the true answer is $5(-4v^5-3)$, but in some cases you will need to factor out the negative of the GCF meaning that you'll have to do it like $-5(4v^5+3)$
		- Might help with grouping?
