- A [[linear equation]] in two variables is an equation of the form:
	- ax + by = c
	- a, b, and c are real numbers
	- a and b are not both zero
- Examples
	- 4x + 3y = 7
	- -2x -4y = 13
	- $\frac 14x$ + 18y = 12
- When we worked with a linear equation in one variable, we generally had exactly one solution.
	- 2x = 8
		- x = 4
- We'll see with linear equations containing 2 variables, there's an infinite number of xy combinations that are going to make the equation true.
- We typically write our x and y values using what is known as an [[ordered pair]]:
	- (x, y)
		- x value on left
		- y value on right
	- Example
		- (3, -1)
- Checking an [[ordered pair]] and seeing if it's a solution to a linear equation with 2 variables
	- Same concept as a linear solution with 1 variable

- Given -4x - y = 16
	- Check (-5,4) : (0,2) : (0.5, -18)
		- -4(-5) - 4 = 16
			- 16 = 16 (True)
		- -4(0) - 2 = 16
			- -2 = 16 (False)
		- -4(0.5) + 18 = 16
			- 16 = 16 (True)
	- Only 2 ordered pairs are solutions
- Given -7x - 3y = 42
	- Check (3,8): (-9,7) : (2,5)
		- -7(3) - 3(8) = 42
			- -45 = 42 (False)
		- -7(-9) - 3(7) = 42
			- 42 = 42 (False)
		- -7(2) - 3(5) = 42
			- 1 = 42 (False)
- We can pick a value for x, and solve for y, or vice versa:

		- -22/3 is the only one shown solved.
