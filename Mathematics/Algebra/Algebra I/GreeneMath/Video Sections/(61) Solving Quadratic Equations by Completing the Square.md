	- [[Perfect square trinomial]]
		- A perfect square is a number with a rational square root
	- Will take trinomials that are not perfect square trinomials and we'll make them into perfect square trinomials through a process called "completing the square". Then we'll use the square root property to get our solution

	- [[Complete the square|Completing the Square]]
		- Write the quadratic equation where the variable terms $ax^2$ and bx are on one side, and the constant is on the other
		- Make the coefficient on the squared term 1, by dividing both sides by the original coefficient
		- Complete the square by adding one - half of the coefficient of the bx term squared to both sides
			- $*$ Cut it in half and then square it
		- Factor and solve the equation using the square root property
	- $x^2 -8x$ are your variable terms
	- Perfect square trinomial
		- $x^2 - 8x + 16$
