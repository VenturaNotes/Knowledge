- So far we have seen how to graph a [[linear inequality]] in two variables such as:
	- 4x - y > 2
		- Solving for y makes it easier to shade for us
			- y < 4x - 2
	- Graph

- Suppose we add another inequality into the mix and create a system:
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-11 at 5.28.57 AM.png|500]]
		- The yellow highlighted region is that area that satisfies the system

## Examples
- To create a boundary line, replace the inequality symbol with an equals sign
