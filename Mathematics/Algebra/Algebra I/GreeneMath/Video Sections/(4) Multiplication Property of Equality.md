- ax + b = c
	- x is most common variable in algebra
	- a $\neq$ 0
	- "1x + b = c" is the same as "x + b = c"
- Example

- How do we isolate "x" in "3x = 9"?
- A number $\times$ its [[reciprocal]] is always 1

	- $\frac {10}{10}$ = 1
	- $\frac {1037}{1037}$ = 1
	- $\frac {0}{0}$ $\neq$ 1
		- You can not have a 0 in the denominator
- If you multiply a number by 1, it remains unchanged
	- $17*1=17$
	- $-15*1=-15$
	- $x*1=x$
	- $z^2*1=z^2$
	- $1y=y$ 
- The [[Multiplication Property of Equality]]
	- We can multiply or divide both sides of an equation by the same non-zero number and maintain the same solution

	- Could also see it as multiplying by the reciprocal

	- $\frac 23$ (15) = 10
		- $\frac {30}{3}$ = 10
			- 10 = 10 $\checkmark$
