	- Before we begin using the formula, let's take a look at where it comes from
	- Standard form of quadratic
	- Deriving the quadratic formula from completing the squares method
	- a, b and c represent real numbers (restriction where a $\ne$ 0)

	- [[Quadratic formula]]
	- Steps
		- $b^2 - 4ac$ is called the [[discriminant]]
		- if $b^2 - 4ac = 0$, there is one solution
		- if $b^2 - 4ac > 0$, there are two solutions
		- if $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, there is no real solution
			- Involves [[complex number system]]
	- Let's take a look at some practice problems
