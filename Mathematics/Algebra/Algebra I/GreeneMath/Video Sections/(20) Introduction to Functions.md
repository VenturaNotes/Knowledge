- Suppose you go to the store and it costs $2 per 1 ounce of granola. This means that for 2 ounces the cost is $4.00, for 3 $6, and so on...
- To mathematically explain this relationship between the number of ounces of granola purchased and the cost:
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 11.05.54 PM.png]]
	- let y = total cost in dollars
	- let x = # of ounces of granola purchased
	- y = 2x
		- 2 is cost per ounce
	- Restriction (limiting a variable to certain values)
		- x $\ge$ 0
	- [[ordered pair|ordered pairs]] is known as a [[relation]]
		- {(0,0), (1,2), (2,4),...}
			- They are put into set braces
			- They are the set of ordered pairs that satisfy the above equation
			- There is a pattern here where x increases by 1 and y increases by 2 and it goes on forever and ever.
		- Relation
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Any set of ordered pairs</mark>
	- [[Set]]
		- A collection of things
- A [[relation]] is any set of ordered pairs (x, y)
	- In any ordered pair x and y are known as the components of the ordered pair.
- The set or list of all <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">first components</mark> (x - values) in the ordered pairs of a relation is called the [[Domain (Math)|domain]].
	- What's the domain of this function?
		- We'd be looking for the set or the list of all possible <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">x values</mark>
- The set or list of all <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">second components</mark> (y -values) in the ordered pairs of a relation is called the [[range]]
	- What's the range of this function?
		- We'd be looking for the set or the list of all possible <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">y values</mark>

## Examples
- Let's take a look at two examples:
	- {(3,7), (2,1), (-8,4), (-2,4)}
		- What's the [[Domain (Math)|domain]] (the set of all first components)? 
			- Domain: {3, 2, -8, -2}
		- What's the [[Range]]?
			- Range: {7, 1, 4}
				- When writing a set, don't need to list the same value of a component twice.
	- {(-9,3), (12,7), (-9,4), (1,8)}
		- What's the Domain?
			- Domain: {-9, 12,, 1}
		- What's the Range?
			- Range: {3, 7, 4, 8}

## Functions
- A [[function (math)|function]] is a set of ordered pairs in which each first component or x - value corresponds to exactly one second component or y -value.
	- For each x, there can only be 1 y
- Relation that is a function
	- {(3,2), (2,1), (8,4), (9,7)}
	- Not every relation is a function but all functions are relations
		- 3 $\rightarrow$ 2
			- The 3 corresponds to 2
		- 2 $\rightarrow$ 1
		- 8 $\rightarrow$ 4
		- 9 $\rightarrow$ 7
	- This is a function because for every x that we have, it corresponds to exactly 1 y value
- Relation that is not a function
	- {(7, -4), (-1, 5), (7,3), (2, -8)}
	- The x-component 7 is a problem
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 11.18.17 PM.png|100]]
			- There are 2 y values
			- No clear association between the x-value and 1 y-value
- Relation #3 (this is a function)
	- {(7,-7), (2,-3), (6,5), (-12,8)} 
		- Looking for duplicate x for this kind of problem

	- 2 different x's can be linked to 1 y.
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 11.22.54 PM.png|500]]
	- Not a function
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 11.23.34 PM.png|500]]
	- This is a function


## Vertical Line Test
- [[Vertical line test]]
- If any vertical line intersects the graph at more than one point, we do not have a function
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 11.24.51 PM.png]]
	- If we don't have a function, there will be a scenario where you can cross at least 2 ordered pairs in your relation.
