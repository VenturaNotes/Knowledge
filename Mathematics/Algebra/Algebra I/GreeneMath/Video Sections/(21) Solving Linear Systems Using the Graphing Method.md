- A system of linear equations consists of two or more linear equations with the same variables.
	- Example
		- $3x - 4y = 4$
		- $x + 4y = 12$
	- Our solution to the system will be an ordered pair that satisfies both equations of the system.

## Examples

	- Solution is given here to check if the equations work
		- (First equation isn't shown to be checked)
	- (0,-1) does not work for both equations simultaneously 
- How do we find the solution to a linear system in two variables?
	- (1) [[Graphing]]
		- Method is slow and inefficient. Method only taught so you understand the concept better.
	- (2) [[Substitution]]
	- (3) [[elimination method|elimination]]
	- (4) [[Matrix Methods]]
		- Used for really big systems
		- Mostly shown in Algebra 2
- Let's start by learning the least efficient method: Graphing

## Solving Systems of Linear Equations by Graphing
- Graph each equation
- The solution is the point of intersection

## Examples
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 11.34.16 PM.png|500]]
	- Solve for y first (slope intercept form) if equation is not already in that form
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 11.38.03 PM.png|500]]
	- You don't always need to label the lines when solving for the point of intersection
- If you have harder problems, you wouldn't even be able to find the solution from graphing because it would go off your coordinate plane.
	- Only with a computer

## Special Cases
- Two parallel lines will never intersect: for this type of system there is no solution
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 11.46.04 PM.png]]
- Once you figure it out on a test that 2 systems of equations are parallel (because they have the same slope but not identical), you can just write down that there is no solution without even needing to graph

	- No Solution
- Two equations that are equivalent: for this type of system there are an infinite number of solutions.

		- We could see this without solving for slope - intercept form by multiplying the second equation by -2.

## Three Possible Solutions
- The system is [[consistent]] and the equations are [[independent]]: 
	- this means our system has exactly one solution, or ordered pair that satisfies both equations
		- This is most of the problems we'll see (95% of the time)
- The system is [[inconsistent]]:
	- This means our lines are parallel and intersection is not possible, there is no solution for this type of system
- The equations are [[dependent]]:
	- The graphs are the same line, this type of system has an infinite number of solutions.
