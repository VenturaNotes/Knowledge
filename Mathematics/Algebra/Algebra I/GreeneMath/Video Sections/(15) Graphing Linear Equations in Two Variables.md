- Why would we want to graph a linear equation in two variables?
	- Linear equations in two variables have an infinite number of solutions
	- A graph gives us a visual representation of all solutions of the equation

	- You can start plugging in values for x that would require you to subtract -12 which would give a number divisible by 3. This is so we get Integers for our points.
	- All points on the line will be a solution to the linear equation
		- We can check if (6,8) is a point on the line by plugging it into the equation
	- Arrows tell us that the line is continuing forever in both directions
- The[[x-intercept]]: location on the coordinate plane where our graph crosses the x-axis
- The [[y - intercept]]: location on the coordinate plane where our graph crosses the y - axis
- [[The Intercept method]]
	- The intercept method is usually much faster than choosing random numbers to plug into the equation
	- We begin by finding the x and y intercepts
	- We also like one additional point for a check

	- To cross the x axis, y has to be 0.
	- To cross the y axis, x has to be 0.
- Additionally we may have to do more work if we get a line that passes through the origin. You can tell right away if your equation looks this way:
	- ax + by = 0

	- x and y intercepts are at the same points
- Let's wrap up our lesson by talking about <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">two special case scenarios:</mark>
	- [[Vertical line]]
	- [[Horizontal line]]
- A [[vertical line]] is one that has a fixed value for x, no matter what the value is for y. This type of line is parallel to the y-axis

		- This is for x = -3 and x = 6
	- Can write ax + by = c as
		- 1x + 0y = -3
			- or x = -3
- A horizontal line is a similar concept. This type of equation has a fixed value for y, no matter what the value is for x. This type of line is parallel to the x-axis

		- y = -2
		- You don't need to find the x values since they will always be on the the horizontal axis of y = -2
		- You could draw a horizontal line through (0,5) when y = 5 or a horizontal line through (0,9) when y = 9
	- 0x  + 1y = -2
		- This is the same as y = -2
