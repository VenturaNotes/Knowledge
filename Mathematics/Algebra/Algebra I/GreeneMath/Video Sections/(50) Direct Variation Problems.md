	- y varies directly with x, if there is a constant k such that: y = kx
		- k is the constant of variation
		- if k > 0 as x increases, y increases
			- As x increases by 1 unit, y increases by k units
	- y = mx
		- m is the slope

	- Let's suppose you purchased gas for $5.25 per gallon. We could model this purchase as:
		- y = 5.25x
			- y is total cost
			- 5.25 is constant of variation
			- x is # of gallons purchased
	- y varies directly with x and y =40 when x = 5. Find y when x = 3

	- Here y varies directly with the nth power of x if there exists a real number k such that:
		- $y=kx^n$
		- Known as "[[direct variation]] as a power"
	- If y varies directly with $x^2$, and y = 50 when x=2, find y when x = 10
