- Another algebraic method for solving a linear system is known as elimination. This method uses the [[addition property of equality]] to eliminate one of the variables of the system.

## Examples

	-  = means "the same as"

	- -2y and +2y are opposites so they'll cancel each other out.
	- Faster Method

## Elimination Method (two variables)
- [[Elimination method]]
- Write both equations in standard form
	- $ax + by = c$
- Transform one or both equations so one pair of variable terms are opposites
- Add the left sides of the equations and set this equal to the sum of the right sides
- Solve for one of the unknowns
- "Plugin" the result from step 4 into either original equation and find the remaining unknown
- Check

## Examples

	- (1) Transform equation so one pair of variable terms are opposites
	- (2) Add equations and solve for unknown
	- (3) Plug-in and solve for other unknown

	- Same strategy as above
	- Needed to transform both equations
	- Just checking that above solution works
