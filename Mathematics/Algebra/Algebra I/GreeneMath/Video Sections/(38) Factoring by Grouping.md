	- Factoring by grouping is pulling out a common [[binomial factor]]
	- When a [[polynomial]] has four terms, we can sometimes factor using a method known as: "[[factoring by grouping]]"
		- Rearrange the terms into two groups so that each group has a common factor
		- Factor out the GCF or -(GCF) from each group
		- If the result yields a common binomial, factor this out
		- if the result does not yield a common binomial factor, try a different grouping
