	- [[Pythagorean Formula]] $a^2+b^2=c^2$
		- Tells us about the relationship between the sides of a right triangle.
		- Helps us develop the distance formula between 2 points
	- For a [[right triangle]] (Has a $90\degree$ angle) ^d13960
		- Shorter sides
			- Leg a
			- Leg b
		- Longest side (will always be opposite of the 90 degree angle)
			- c hypotenuse
	- A $90 \degree$ angle is known as a right angle
		- The square is a symbol that denotes a triangle having a right angle

	- If a=3, and b = 4, what is c?
	- Distance can only be positive
	- [[Distance formula]]
		- $d = \sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}$

	- Find the distance between each pair of points: (5,-2), (-7,-7)
	- You can sometimes approximate the distance if you get an [[irrational number]].
