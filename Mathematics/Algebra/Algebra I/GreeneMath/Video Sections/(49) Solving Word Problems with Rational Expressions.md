	- The two most common problems in this area are
		- Motion problems
		- Work/[[rate problems]]
	- We'll begin with a [[motion problem]]. Recall that we use the [[distance formula]] for this type of problem: $d=r*t$
		- d = distance
		- r = rate of speed
		- t = time traveled
	- We can also solve for "r" or "t"

	- Problem #1
		- The local river has a current of 3mph. A boat takes the same amount of time to go 24 miles downstream as it does to go 12 miles upstream. What is the speed of the boat in still water?
			- Downstream means with the current
			- Upstream means against the current
			- let x = speed of the boat in still water
		- The boat travels 9mph in still water
	- Problem #2 (Work-rate problem or rate of work problem)
		- Working alone, Paul can pour a large concrete driveway in five hours. Natalie can pour the same driveway in seven hours. How long would it take them to complete this job if they worked together?
			- Let x = # of hours to complete the job if they work together
		- It would take $\frac {35}{12}$ hours to complete the job.
