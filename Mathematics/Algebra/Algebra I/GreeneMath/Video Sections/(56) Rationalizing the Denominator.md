- Introduction
	- Simplified form of a [[radical]]: ^5c776a
		- the radicand contains no factor (except 1) that is a:
			- Perfect square - square root
			- Perfect cube - cube root
			- Perfect fourth - fourth root
			- so on and so forth
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-26 at 11.13.39 PM.png|300]]
		- the [[radicand]] cannot contain fractions
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-26 at 11.14.19 PM.png|300]]
		- there is no [[radical]] present in any denominator

	- Practice/Examples
	- When the denominator is $\sqrt2$ which is an irrational number, we rationalize the denominator by multiplying the top and bottom by $\sqrt{2}$ so that the denominator = 2 (which is a rational number). This is why it's called [[rationalizing the denominator]].
	- Might be best to simplify denominator first

	- We may be faced with multiple terms in the numerator or denominator. We'll cover more complex scenarios in the next lesson.
	- Need to find a cube root of 4 to completely rationalize the denominator.
	- Build a factor tree to find the root you can rationalize with if the index is not 2. Otherwise rationalizing may take longer
