	- Using rational numbers as exponents
	- Let's suppose we saw

	- So let's define our first rule: let a $\ge$ 0 and n is a positive integer

	- Can use [[power rule of exponents]] to break up the exponent

		- if n is even, x $\ge$ 0
			- You can take an expression in radical form (with a radical sign) and turn it into rational form (fractional form) by using a [[fractional exponent]] with the original exponent on top and root on bottom (remember: the root is in a “cave” so it needs to go on the bottom).
		- n is odd
			- Note that this works with n is even too, if $x \ge$ 0
	- If a $\ge$ 0 and m and n are integers with n > 0 then:
