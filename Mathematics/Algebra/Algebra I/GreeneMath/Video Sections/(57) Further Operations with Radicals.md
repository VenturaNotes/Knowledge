- Introduction
	- Let's |revisit the simplified form of a radical [^1]:
		- the radicand contains no factor other than 1 which is:
			- perfect square - square root
			- prefect cube - cube root
			- perfect fourth - fourth root
			- so on and so forth...
		- the radicand cannot contain fractions
		- there is no radical present in any denominator

	- Practice/Examples
	- For the $(6 + \sqrt{2})(6-\sqrt{2})$ problem, you could use the difference of squares

	- A [[conjugate]] is formed when we change the sign:
	- When we simplify a radical expression with two terms in the denominator and at least one is a radical
		- We multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator
