	- y varies inversely with x if there is some constant k such that:
		- $y = \frac kx$
		- if x > 0
			- As x increases, y decreases
			- As x decreases, y increases

	- If y varies inversely with x and y = 7 when x = 5, find y when x = 2

	- The current in a simple electrical circuit varies inversely with the resistance. If the current is 30 amps when the resistance is 5 ohms, find the current when the resistance is 15 ohms.
		- [[Ohm's Law]]
			- I $\rightarrow$ [[current]]
			- R $\rightarrow$ [[resistance]]
			- V $\rightarrow$ k $\rightarrow$ [[constant of variation]]
				- V is the [[voltage]]
		- The current is 10 amps when the resistance is 15 ohms.
	- We also have [[inverse variation]] as a power. y varies inversely with the nth power of x if there exists a real number k such that:
		- $y = \frac {k}{x^n}$
	- y varies inversely with $q^2$ and y = 4 when q = 5, find y when q = 15
	- The amount of light measured in foot-candles produced by a light source varies inversely with the square of the distance from the source.
		- If the light produced 10 feet from a light source is 12 foot-candles, find the light produced 20 feet away from the same source.
		- $L = \frac kd$
		- The light produced 20 feet away from the light source is 3 foot-candles
