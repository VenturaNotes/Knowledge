- A very important characteristic of a line is its <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">slope</mark> or steepness
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-08 at 10.27.55 AM.png|200]]
		- For every 10 miles you travel, the road is dropping by a mile.
- We measure slope by comparing the change in y values (vertical change) to the change in x values (horizontal change) while moving along our line from one point to another.
- Calculating [[Slope]]:
	- Pick any two points on the line
		- this means any two ordered pairs)
	- Label the points as:
		- ($X_1,Y_1$) and ($X_2,Y_2$)
			- The above is read as "X sub one" and "X sub two"
				- This is a way for us to notate that we have 2 different x values that we're thinking about here without actually changing variables
				- X value is a value that corresponds to the horizontal axis
					- Need to be consistent. Can't just have some variable Z.
				- "X" will always correspond to the horizontal axis and "Y" will always correspond to the vertical axis.
		- Does not matter which point you label as ($X_1,Y_1$) and ($X_2,Y_2$)
	- Plug into the slope formula:

			- m stands for slope
			- Chang in y values over change in x values
			- The X values can never be identical when calculating slope
			- Slope equals rise over run

## Examples
- Let's start with two points:
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-08 at 10.37.57 AM.png]]
	- You can plot the points by rising up 1 and running left 1
	- (-1,1) could be labeled as $X_2,Y_2$  and (20,-20) could be labeled as $X_1,Y_1$. It does not make a difference

- If we know one point on the line and the slope, we can easily graph any equation.

	- Given Point: (-2,4) and m = -2
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-08 at 10.55.56 AM.png]]
	- Using rise over run of a graphed line, you can find the slope
	- We notice that each point difference is down 2 and 3 units to the right
	- Could use the points to find if you get a slope of $\frac {-2}{3}$ 
- A line with a positive slope rises as we move right
	- As $x\uparrow y\uparrow$ 
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-08 at 10.57.07 AM.png|200]]
- A line with a negative slope falls as we move right
	- As $x\uparrow y\downarrow$

- Special case scenarios
	- The slope of any [[horizontal line]] is always zero!
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-08 at 10.58.42 AM.png]]
			- y = 7
	- A [[vertical line]] has an undefined slope
		- The change in x values will be zero and division by zero is undefined

				- x = 2
