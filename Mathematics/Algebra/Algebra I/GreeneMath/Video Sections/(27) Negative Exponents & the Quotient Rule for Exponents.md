- What can we do if we see
	- Will learn[[ negative exponents]], the [[power of zero]], and the [[quotient rule]] for exponents

	- Divide answer by base
- Any non-zero real number that is raised to the power of 0 is 1:
	- $a^0 = 1$
		- This is because $a^0 = \frac aa = 1$
	- $a \ne 0$
- Examples

		- xy have a limitation that neither can equal 0

## Negative Exponents in Numerator

- For negative exponents, we think about these using reciprocals
- For any non-zero real number a and any integer n:
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-19 at 2.57.13 AM.png]]
		- Just taking the reciprocal of the [[base]]

## Negative Exponents in Denominator

- What happens when your negative exponent is in the denominator?
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-19 at 3.01.32 AM.png]]
- If we have a negative exponent, move the base across the fraction bar and change the sign of the exponent
	- For any non-zero real numbers a and b and any integers m and n:

## Suppose you need to simplify

	- Keep the base the same and subtract (m-n)

## Examples

- Even when negative exponents are involved, we follow the same rules
