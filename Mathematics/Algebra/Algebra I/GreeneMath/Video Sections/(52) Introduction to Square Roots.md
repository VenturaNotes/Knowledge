	- We will begin with [[square root|square roots]]: Squaring a number means to multiply a number by itself:
	- What if I gave you the following?
		- $a^2 = 225$ 
			- a = ?
		- You could use [[prime factorization]] to find the square root of a number (if the root is a whole number)
	- The [[principal square root]]is the positive number square root
		- Principal square root of 225 is 15
			- $\sqrt{225}$ equaling -15 is just the negative square root

	- If a > 0 then:
		- $\sqrt{a}$ is a positive number that when squared gives us: a
		- $-\sqrt{a}$ is a negative number that when squared gives us: a

	- When we square the square root symbol, the two cancel each other out. Squaring and square root are opposite operations, just like multiplication/division

	- Recall that a [[Rational Numbers|rational number]] is one that can be formed from the quotient of two integers. In decimal form it terminates or repeats the pattern forever.
		- $21.\overline{3}$ 
			- This is a rational number as the 3 repeats forever.
		- $\frac {28}{3}$
			- Quotient of 2 integers.
	- Any number whose square root is a rational number is called a "[[perfect square]]"
		- $\sqrt{225}$ = 15
		- $\sqrt{9}$ = 3
		- $\sqrt\frac 14$ = $\frac 12$
	- An [[irrational number]] is one that cannot be written as the ratio of two integers. Its decimal does not terminate nor does it repeat.
		- $\sqrt{2}$ $\approx$ 1.41
		- Famous example is $\pi$ 
	- When we get an [[irrational]] square root, generally we will approximate by rounding to the nearest hundredth: (used calculators for below)
		- $\sqrt{11}$ $\approx$ 3.32
		- $\sqrt{7}$ $\approx$ 2.65
	- We also need to understand that not every real number has a square root
		- $\sqrt{-4}$ is not a real number

	- We saw that the square root is the reverse of squaring. Similarly the cube root is the reverse of cubing.
		- $2^3 = 2*2*2 = 8$
		- $\sqrt[3]{8}$ = 2
	- $\sqrt[n]{a}$ (whole thing is a radical (also known as root))
		- n is the index
		- a is the radicand
	- $\sqrt[5]{a}$
		- When looking for the 5th root of something. We're looking for a number that when multiplied by itself 5 times gives that number, (the radicand (a))
	- Don't typically write the "2" is the index
	- When the [[- Topics/index]] is equal to 1, the [[radical]] becomes the [[radicand]] itself
		- $\sqrt[1]{4}$ = 4
		- $a^4$ = $\sqrt[1]{a^4}$

	- Can find a real number when solving for a radical with an odd root and a negative radicand.
	- A radicand with an odd index: 3, 5, 7,... can have a negative radicand
	- Bottom-right problem has an even index meaning that the result will not be a real number
