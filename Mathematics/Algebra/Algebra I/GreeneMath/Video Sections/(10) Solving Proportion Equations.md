- Let's recall that a [[ratio]] is a comparison of two quantities
	- a:b
		- a to b
	- $\frac ab$ 
- For example, let's think about the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom. Suppose there are 12 boys and 3 girls.

- A [[rate]] is a ratio in which the units are different. Typically we see these as unit rates. How much of something per one unit of another.

## Examples
- A car drove 300 miles on 6 gallons of gas

		- Single unit in denominator
- 12 eggs purchased for $3.60
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-06 at 6.30.09 PM.png|300]]
		- This is the unit cost (the cost per 1 egg)
		- It's a single unit which is why we call it a [[unit rate]]

## Proportion
- A [[proportion]] states that two ratios are equal. Recall that we can determine if there's a proportion by using the equality test for fractions.

		- This is an equality test
		- Make sure to cross multiply
