- A [[term]] 
	- could be 7, 1, 7x, $2xy$, $2x^4y^3z$ 
- [[Algebraic expression]]
	- A single term by itself or a collection of terms separated by +/- symbols.
	- 7x - 2
	- 3 "the number 3 is also an algebraic expression"
		- ![[(1) Variables and Algebraic Expressions#^1a6f93]]
			- This makes no sense. GreeneMath says that 3 is an algebraic expression but there are no variables. 
			- "Numeric expressions apply operations to numbers. For example, 2(3+8) is a numeric expression. Algebraic expressions include at least on variable and at least one operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). For example, 2(x+8y) is an algebraic expression" [^1]
	- $4x^2 - 2y + 17$ 
- Recall that an equation is a statement that two algebraic expressions are equal
	- 2x + 3 = 11
		- We can simplify the x on the left side to make the left side equal to the right side.
		- 11 is an algebraic expression and 2x+3 in an algebraic expression
		- 2(4) + 3 = 11
			- 8 + 3 = 11
				- 11 = 11
					- By simplification when plugging 4 into x, we find that the equation is true statement because the same value occurs on the left and the right.

			- Only x = 4 is a solution to the equation.
- A solution to an equation is any value that makes the equation true when it replaces the variable.
- ax + b = c
	- Could also be written as "ay + b = c" or "az + b = c". Doesn't really matter how variable is represented
	- Restrictions
		- a, b & c can be any real numbers
		- a $\neq$ 0
	- Definitions
		- "a" is the # multiplying a variable. "a" is a coefficient
			- In "-7x", -7 is the coefficient of x
		- b is a constant and c is a constant
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-07 at 12.39.29 PM.png]]
				- -3 is a coefficient
				- -7 is a constant
				- 2 is a constant
	- Examples
		- x + b = c
		- x + 3 = 7
		- x - 4 = 2
			- Same thing as x + (-4) = 2
- [Property of Opposites](https://www.varsitytutors.com/hotmath/hotmath_help/topics/properties-of-addition#:~:text=property%20of%20opposites) is a number plus its opposite is always 0.
	- 3 + (-3) = 0
- Additive Identity property (adding 0 to a number)
	- 5 + 0 = 5
	- 6 + 0 = 6
	- x + 0 = x
	- $z^2$ + 0 = $z^2$ 
- [[Addition property of equality]]
	- We can add the same number to both sides of an equation without changing the solution

## Examples
- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-07 at 1.48.57 PM.png]]
	- Isolate the variable (have x by itself.)
	- Can check by doing "6 + 4 = 10" and "10=10
		- End up with the same value on the left as on the right.
