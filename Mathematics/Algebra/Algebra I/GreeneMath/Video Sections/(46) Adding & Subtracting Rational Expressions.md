	- The harder scenario occurs when we add/subtract [[rational expression|rational expressions]] without a common denominator
		- Find the LCD (least common denominator)
		- Rewrite each rational expression as an equivalent rational expression where the LCD is its denominator
		- Add/subtract numerators
		- Simplify
	- Examples/Practice
