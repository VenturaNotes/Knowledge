	- A radical equation is an equation where there is a variable in the radicand
	- To solve a radical equation, we need to introduce a new property of equality known as the
		- [[squaring property of equality]]
			- When both sides of an equation are squared, all solutions to the original equation are among the solutions to the squared equation.
			- Need to check every solution that you generate in order to make sure it works in the original equation.
	- Let's suppose we had x=3
	- Solving a [[radical equation]]
		- isolate the radical
		- square both sides
		- combine any like terms
		- Solve the equation and check all potential solutions in the original equation
