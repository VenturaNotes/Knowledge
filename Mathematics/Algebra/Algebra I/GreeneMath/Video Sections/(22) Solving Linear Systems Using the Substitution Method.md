- In the last lesson, we talked about how we could solve a linear system in two variables using graphing.
- Graphing is extremely inefficient. It's hard to find a solution for:
	- Large numbers
	- Small Numbers
	- Non integer values
		- (-3/4, 1/7)
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-10 at 11.59.57 PM.png]]
	- Solve for a variable that has 1 or -1 (easier)
		- Doesn't matter which variable or equation you solve for first. All 4 variations work.
	- Must always plug-in the variable you solve for into the other equation. Otherwise you'll just get 0 for the equation you originally solved for. (this is the wrong way to do substitution)

## Substitution Method (two variables):
- Solve one equation for either variable
- Substitute for that variable in the other equation
- Solve for the other unknown
- Check the result

## Examples

	- This is just showing how to check the answer

	- Method of Elimination would be perfect for this problem
	- Shows checking the second equation

## Special Case Scenarios:
- Infinite Solutions

- No Solution

		- (1) Solve for a variable
		- (2) Plug in variable to other equation
		- (3) Show both equations in slope-intercept form that they have the same slope but different y-intercept
			- Solution shows same slope but different y-intercept so <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">No Solution</mark>
