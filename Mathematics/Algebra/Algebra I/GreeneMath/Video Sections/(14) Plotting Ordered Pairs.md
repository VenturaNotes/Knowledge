- In the last lesson, we learned that a linear equation in two variables has an infinite number of solutions. We display a solution as an ordered pair: (x, y)

	- Both are points are solutions
- In the next section we'll learn how to graph a linear equation in two variables. In order to do that, first we have to be able to plot an ordered pair.
- Let's begin by talking about the [[Coordinate Plane|Cartesian Coordinate System]](rectangular coordinate system, coordinate plane):
	- Consists of two number lines
	- one horizontal
	- one vertical

	- [[Horizontal axis]] is the x-axis
	- Place they intersect is the [[origin]] (0,0)
	- 4 [[quadrants]] ^876e77

			- x values positive
			- y values positive
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">II</mark> (Upper Left Quadrant) (-,+)
			- x values negative
			- y values positive
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">III</mark> (Lower Left Quadrant) (-, -)
			- x values negative
			- y values negative
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">IV</mark> (Lower Right Quadrant) (+, -)
			- x values positive
			- y values negative
- How exactly do we plot an ordered pair? We simply find the meeting of the x location and y location.
- Plot each ordered pair and determine which quadrant it lies in:
