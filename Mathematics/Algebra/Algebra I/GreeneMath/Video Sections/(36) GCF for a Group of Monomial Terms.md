	- Recall that the [[Greatest Common Divisor|GCF]] is the largest number that each number of a group is divisible by
	- Finding the GCF:
		- Factor each number
		- List every prime factor that is common to all numbers of the group
		- for prime factors that are common to all we list the least amount of times it appears
		- multiply the numbers of the list together to form the GCF

	- Find the GCF of 20, 45, and 60
	- Practice/Examples
	- Greatest common factor is also known as the greatest common divisor

	- In addition to find the GCF of numbers, we also need to be able to find the GCF when variables are involved.
		- the process for finding the number part is the same
		- the variable part includes any variable that is common to all; the exponent on the variable is the smallest that occurs in the group
