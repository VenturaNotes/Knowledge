- [[(8) Solving Word Problems with Linear Equations I#^6be7c4|Solving a word problem]]

## Mixture Problems:
- These problems involve mixing two or more substances and then finding some unknown

### Examples
- A chemist has 20 liters of a 25% acid solution. How much pure acid is in this solution?
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">20 * 0.25 = 5 so there is 5 liters of pure acid</mark>
- For her birthday party, Tina mixed together 2 liters of Joe's fruit punch and 10 liters of Babe's fruit punch. Joe's fruit punch contains 15% fruit juice, while Babe's contains 45%. What is the percentage of fruit juice in the mixture

## Motion Problems:
- These problems involve the distance formula:
	- Distance = rate x time

### Examples
- Shannon left the science fair and traveled toward the recycling plant. Amanda left 1 hour later traveling 22 miles per hour faster in an effort to catch up to her. After 2 hours of traveling, Amanda finally caught up. What was Shannon's average speed?
