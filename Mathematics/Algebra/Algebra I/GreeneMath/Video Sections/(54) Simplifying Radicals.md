	- Let's begin by talking about the [[product rule]] for [[Radical|Radicals]]:
		- for two non-negative real numbers a, and b:
			- $\sqrt{a}*\sqrt{b} = \sqrt{a*b}$

	- Practice/Examples

	- A square root is considered simplified when no perfect square exists under the radical sign
	- Can look for pairs of numbers in radicand, you can pull it outside the square root.

	- Now let's talk about the quotient rule for radicals:
		- if a and b are non-negative real numbers and b $\ne$ 0 then

	- When radicals appear with variables in the radicand, we have to be careful
		- We will assume that all variables are non-negative

	- You have higher roots that you can apply these techniques to
	- Same thing for the quotient rule with higher roots
