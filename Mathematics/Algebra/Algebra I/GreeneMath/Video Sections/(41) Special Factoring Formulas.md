	- Factoring the [[difference of two squares]]
		- $(x+y)(x-y)=x^2-y^2$
	- To identify if a binomial is a difference of two squares
		- Both terms must be squares
		- $*$Second term is negative

	- Let's take a look at some [[perfect square trinomials]]

		- Examples/Practice
		- To solve for them, check if the middle term is equal to "2xy" in which the "x" and "y" are the square roots of the x and y terms. 
			- So basically do $2\sqrt{x}\sqrt{y}$ to see if equals the middle term
