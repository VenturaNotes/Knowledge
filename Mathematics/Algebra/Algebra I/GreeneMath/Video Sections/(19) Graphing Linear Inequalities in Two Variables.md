- A [[linear inequality]] in two variables is of the form
	- ax + by > c
		- a and b are coefficients
		- c is a constant
		- a, b, and c are real numbers
		- "a" and "b" cannot be both 0 at the same time.
	- where > can be:
		- < $\le$, $\ge$ 
- Graphing a linear inequality in two variables is very similar to graphing a linear equation in two variables.
- The first step is to draw a boundary line. The boundary line separates the solution region from the non-solution region.

- We obtain our boundary line by replacing the inequality symbol with an equals sign and graphing the line
- There are two scenarios:
	- A [[strict inequality]] - dashed or broken boundary line
		- Boundary line not part of solution
		- x < 3
			- < is strict

	- A [[non-strict inequality]] - solid boundary line
		- Boundary line is part of solution
		- x $\leq$ 3 (strict)

## Slow Method

	- Test Point
		- You can test any point on either side of the line. If it works, that side of the line is the solution region and therefore you're going to shade that side of the line. If it doesn't work, you're in the non-solution region and you're gonna shade the other side of the line.
		- (0,0) is the easiest point to choose

## Fast Method

	- Alternatively, we can solve the inequality for y:
		- Draw the boundary line
		- Shade above the line for >, $\ge$ 
		- Shade below the line for <, $\le$

## Special Case Scenarios
- Let's look at a few special case scenarios.

	- x > 4 (strict)
		- x = 4
	- If x > 4, greater than in terms of the x axis means you're going to the right. This is because you are increasing on the x-axis towards the right
