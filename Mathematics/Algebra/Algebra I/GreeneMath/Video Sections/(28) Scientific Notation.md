- One immediate application of integer exponents is [[scientific notation]]. This will make it more convenient to write really large or really small numbers
- When multiplying by ten or ten raised to a whole number 1 or larger:
	- The decimal point moves right one place for each zero in the power of ten

- Also recall that we have a shortcut to evaluate 10 raised to a whole number 1 or larger:
	- $10^3 = 1000$
	- $10^4 = 10,000$
	- $10^9 = 1,000,000,000$
- Basically if we multiply a number by 10 raised to a positive integer:
	- Move the decimal point to the right by the number of places equal to the exponent
- Examples
	- $7.3 \times 10^5 = 730,000$
	- $6.829 \times 10^4 = 68,290$
- Dividing by 10 or 10 raised to a whole number 1 or larger:
	- Move the decimal point one place to the left for each zero in the power of 10
- Examples
	- $\frac {64}{100} = 0.64$
	- $\frac {128000}{1000} = 128$
	- $64 \times 10^{-1} = 6.4$
	- $128,000 \times 10^{-3} = 128$
	- $5.476 \times 10^{-4} = 0.0005476$

## Scientific Notation
- (1) Place the decimal point to the right of the first non-zero digit in the number
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-19 at 3.20.29 AM.png]]
- (2) Count the number of places the decimal point was moved - this will be the absolute value for the exponent on 10
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-19 at 3.21.14 AM.png]]
- (3) The exponent is positive if the original number is larger than the new number formed; the exponent is negative if the original number is smaller than the new number formed
- (4) Set up the scientific notation as:
	- $a \times 10^n$ 
		- a is the number formed in step 1
		- n is the exponent
- If exponent is positive, move decimal to the right. If exponent negative, move the decimal to the left when writing out into [[Standard Notation|standard notation]]

- We can also perform operations with numbers in scientific notation
