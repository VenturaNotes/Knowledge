	- The quotient of two integers, where the denominator is not zero is known as a rational number
		- $\frac 12, \frac {-2}{5}, \frac 38$
		- $\frac{\sqrt{5}}{{3}}$
			- This is not a rational number since the numerator is not an integer
		- $\frac 31$ is represented as rational number
	- Similarly, the quotient of two polynomials with a non-zero denominator is called a [[rational expression]]
		- $\frac {3x-4}{x^2-1}$
		- $\frac {5x^3}{2x-4}$
		- $\frac {8x^4-5x-3}{2x^3-7}$
	- Our first topic for rational expressions is to learn where they are undefined
	- Since we can never divide by zero, we must exclude any value for any variable that would make the denominator zero.
	- How can we determine where the rational expression is defined:
		- set the denominator equal to zero
		- solve the resulting equation
		- the solutions are the values that will make the rational expression undefined
	- For first problem, when x = 4 and x = -4, we have vertical asymptotes

	- Next, let's talk about simplifying rational expressions:
		- Recall that

	- With a rational expression
		- Factor the numerator and denominator completely
		- Cancel any common factors
	- Reason we simplify is because it makes it easier to plug-in our value or variable
	- When simplifying, the x-value can still not exist in the simplified version of the rational expression if it makes the denominator in the original rational expression equal to 0
