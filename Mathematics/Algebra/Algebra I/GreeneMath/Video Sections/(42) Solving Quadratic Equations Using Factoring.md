	- A quadratic equations contains a squared variable (such as $x^2$) and no other term with a higher degree.
	- Generally, we think about quadratic equations in standard form:
		- $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ where a$\ne$ 0: a, b, and c are real numbers
	- Recall that a solution for an equation is any value that makes the equation true when it replaces the variable

	- Let's get our feet wet with a typical [[quadratic equation]]
	- [[Zero-Product Property]]
		- If ab = 0
			- a=0 or 
			- b=0 or 
			- both a and b = 0
	- [[Solution Set]]
		- Set braces: {} and inside set braces you list the solutions for your equation {-3,-1}
