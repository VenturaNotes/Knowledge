- In pre-algebra, we learned that whole number [[Exponent|exponents]] 1 or larger were used as notation to display repeated multiplication of the same number.
- The number being multiplied is known as the base; the number of factors of the base is known as the exponent:

		- Can make the base a variable as well such as "x"

## Product Rule for Exponents
- Let's take a look at our first rule ([[product rule]] for exponents)

## Examples

	- When we get out of algebra 1, we'll know up to $2^8$ power by heart

	- Textbook usually not going to ask you to evaluate $3^7$ 
- $x^2 * x^4 = x^6$ 
- $z^8 * z * z^3 = z^{12}$ 

## Power Rules
- Let's look at the [[power to power rule]]:
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-11 at 5.42.19 AM.png|200]]

## Examples
- $(3^2)^4$ = $3^8$ 
- $(7^5)^6 = 7^{30}$
- $(x^4)^3 = x^{12}$
- $(z^9)^8 = z^{72}$ 
- $(y^5)^3 = y^{15}$ 

## Raising a product to a power
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-11 at 5.44.57 AM.png|300]]

## Examples
- $(2x)^2 = 2^2 * x^2 = 2^2x^2 = 4x^2$ 
- $4^2*3^2 = (4*3)^2=12^2$ 
- $(5xy)^9 = 5^9x^9y^9$
- $(3zq)^2 = 3^2z^2q^2$
- $(-8x)^4 = (-8)^4x^4$

## Fraction raised to Exponent
- ![[Screenshot 2023-02-11 at 5.50.57 AM.png|300]]
- $[\frac {8}{4}]^2 = \frac {8^2}{4^2} = \frac {64}{16} = 4$
- $[\frac {5}{2}]^4 = \frac {5^4}{2^4}$
- $[\frac {x}{y}]^7 = \frac {x^7}{y^7}$
	- Generally speaking while working with variables and we have a variable in our denominator, it's assumed that our variable in the denominator is not allowed to be 0 because that would be undefined.
	- However, we can specifically specify that y $\neq$ 0. If you don't put that, it's logical to assume that that variable cannot be 0.
- $[\frac {z}{2q}]^14 = \frac {z^{14}}{2^{14}q^{14}}$
