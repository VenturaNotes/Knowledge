	- In this lesson, we will focus on how to factor a [[trinomial]] of the form: $ax^2 + bx + c$
		- where a=1
			- a and b are coefficients on their x terms
			- c is a constant
		- Need two integers whose sum is "b" and whose product is "c"

	- Steps
		- Look for any common factors first
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-16 at 4.20.40 PM.png]]
		- Find two integers whose sum is b and whose product is c (if no two integers exist, we have a [[(Video) Prime Polynomials|prime polynomial]])
	- Examples
		- $m^2 + 9m - 9$ is a prime polynomial
		- $x^2 - 4xy - 21y^2$ shows how to find factors of a polynomial with 2 variables
			- When you see something with more than 2 variables involved, it's no more difficult. Just see the second variable you're working with as a constant.
				- Also -7y + 3y = -4y which is the middle "bx" term
