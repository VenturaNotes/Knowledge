	- Now we will focus on factoring [[trinomial|trinomials]] of the form:
		- $ax^2 + bx + c$ where a $\ne$ 1
	- [[Factoring by Grouping]]
		- Factor any common factor, this will save additional work in the end.
		- Consider: $ax^2 + bx + c$, look for two integers whose product is ac and whose sum is b
		- Use the integers to rewrite the middle term so that we have a polynomial with four terms
		- at this point, we can use factoring by grouping

	- Now let's learn an alternative method, which involves reversing FOIL using trial and error. (GreeneMath.com does not recommend this method as it's tedious )
		- Tip: If your original trinomial did not have a common factor, then you won't have any common factor in the binomials
			- For example $2x^2 + 11x + 12$ when searching for its factors, we could check $(2x+12)$, since 1 and 12 are factors of "c", but since you can factor out a 2, it's most likely not going to be an answer (need to check if the pair (1,12) works on either binomials)
