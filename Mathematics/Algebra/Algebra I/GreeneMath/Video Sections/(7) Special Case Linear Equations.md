- [[linear equation|linear equations]] with no solution or an infinite number of solutions
- So far, we have only worked with one type of equation. This equation is known as a [[conditional equation]]. It is true only under certain conditions
	- For $-2x =4$, the solution is $x=-2$. This is a conditional equation because the equation is true under the specific condition that $x = -2$ 
- The next type of equation is known as an identity. An identity is always true no matter what we replace our variable with. An identity has an infinite number of solutions.
	- Example
		- $3x - 12 = 3(x-4)$
			- $3x - 12 = 3x - 12$ 
			- Solution is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">All real numbers</mark>
- Lastly, we see equations with no solution. These equations are known as <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">contradictions</mark>.
	- Example
		- $-2 = 2 - 6(n-n)$
			- $-2 = 2 -6n + 6n$ 
			- -2 $\neq$ 2
		- The above equation is wrong. Answer is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">no solution</mark>

	- If one side does not equal the other, there is [[no solution]]. It's a [[contradiction]].
