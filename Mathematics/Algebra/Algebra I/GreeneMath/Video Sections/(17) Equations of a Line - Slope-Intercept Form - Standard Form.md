- There are many ways to manipulate a [[linear equation]] in two variables. Each form of the line has a specific use.
- Slope - Intercept Form:
	- y = mx + b
		- y is on one side of the equation by itself
		- m is the slope
		- b is the y-intercept (0,b)

## Examples

	- Finding the slope
	- If given the slope and y-intercept, you can just write the equation
	- You could also manipulate a linear equation into slope intercept form to find the slope and y-intercept

## Graphing
- A very useful application of slope - intercept form is graphing
	- Quickest way to graph a linear equation with 2 variables

	- Could check if (-4,4) is a solution by plugging it into the equation

## Point - Slope Form:

	- It comes from the slope formula
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">One known point and slope</mark>
	- You can derive the point slope formula by cross multiplying the top equation

	- Finding point - slope form from 2 points
	- Can use either point for point - slope form

## Standard Form
- Definitions vary for [[standard form]]
- Definition 1 (high school or in college algebra)
	- ax + by = c
	- a, b, and c are real numbers
	- a and b are not both zero
- Definition 2 (stricter version in algebra 1 or 2 in high school)
	- ax + by = c
	- a, b, and c are integers
	- a and b are not both zero
	- a $\geq$ 0
- Stricter definition is for lower level mathematics classes for more practice
- Stricter definition will be used for following examples
