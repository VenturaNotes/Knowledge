	- A binomial is a polynomial with 2 terms
	- $(x+y)^2$
		- Can be said as "x + y" quantity squared
	- Use the [[Foil]] Method
	- The [[Square of a binomial]]
		- Don't think of the "-" in $(x-3)$, just follow the general formula as "x" and "3" being separate terms

	- Another common scenario occurs when we multiply two binomials and one is the sum of two terms, while the other is the difference of the same two terms.
	- [[Difference of 2 squares]]

	- Lastly, let's look at a binomial that is cubed
		- This is different from sum/difference of 2 cubes
			- [[Difference of cubes]]
			- [[Sum of cubes]]

		- Practice
		- $(x+4)^3$
			- Can be said as "x plus 4 this quantity cubed"
