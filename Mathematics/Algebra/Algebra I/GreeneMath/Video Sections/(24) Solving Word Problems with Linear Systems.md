- We previously learned how to set up and solve a word problem that involves a linear equation in one variable. Here we will apply a similar process to solve problems that involve a [[linear system]] in two variables.
- Solving a Word Problem that involves a Linear System in two Variables
	- Read the Problem carefully; get a clear understanding of the objective
	- Assign a variable to represent each unknown
	- Write two equations using both variables
	- Solve the linear system
	- State the answer
	- Check

## Examples
- Kayla and Kristin are selling wrapping paper for a school fundraiser. Customers can buy rolls of plain wrapping paper and rolls of holiday wrapping paper. Kayla sold 6 rolls of plain wrapping paper and 5 rolls of holiday wrapping paper for a total of $149. Kristin sold 6 rolls of plain wrapping paper and 2 rolls of holiday wrapping paper for a total of $92. Find the cost of one roll of plain wrapping paper, and one roll of holiday wrapping paper.
	- "Cost" is "sale price"

		- Solve by using elimination

		- Let x = cost of one roll of plain wrapping paper
		- then y = cost of one roll of holiday wrapping paper
- A plane traveled 700 miles to Farland and back. The trip there was with the wind, and took only 7 hours. The trip back was into the wind and took 14 hours. Find the speed of the plane in still air and the speed of the wind.

		- This problem was understood as if the trip was 700 miles to Farland and 700 miles back from Farland. Was not considered a round trip
		- Needed to use d=rt formula for this
