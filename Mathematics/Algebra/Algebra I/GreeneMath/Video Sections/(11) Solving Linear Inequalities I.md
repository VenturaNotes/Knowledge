- < less than
	- Strict
- $\leq$ less than or equal to
	- Non-strict
- > greater than
	- Strict
- $\geq$ greater than or equal to
	- non-strict
- The symbols "<" and ">" (less than and greater than) are referred to as [[strict inequality|strict inequalities]].
- The symbols "$\leq$" and "$\geq$" (less than or equal to and greater than or equal to) are known as [[non-strict inequality|non-strict inequalities]]

	- This is a visual representation of the solution to the equation.
- For x > 2, the solution will generally be a range of values.

			- Shaded in circle means that the number is included.
			- Non-shaded circle means that the number is not included

## Addition Property of Inequality
- [[Addition Property of inequality]]
- We can add/subtract any number to/from both sides of an inequality without changing the solution

## Multiplication Property of Inequality
- We can multiply/divide both sides of an inequality by the same <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">positive number</mark> without changing the solution.
- If we use the [[multiplication property of inequality]] with a negative number, we must reverse the direction of the inequality to preserve the solution.

## Examples

	- Checking a Linear Inequality in one variable uses 3 steps
		- Replace inequality symbols with = symbols
			- Then set x = -3
			- Verifying this refers to our [[boundary]]
				- Separates the solution region from the non-solution region
		- Now try a number from the [[non-solution region]]
			- Set x = 0
				- We get 8 < 5 which is false. This means we have our non-solution region correct
		- Now choose a number from the [[solution region]]
			- Set x = -5
				- 3 < 5 is true so this is part of the solution region.
	- Doing the check is extremely time consuming
