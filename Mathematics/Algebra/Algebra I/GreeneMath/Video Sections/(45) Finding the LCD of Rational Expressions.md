- We should all remember that adding or subtracting fractions requires a common denominator.
- The LCD or [[least common denominator]] is the smallest number that is divisible by all denominators. The LCD is the LCM ([[least common multiple]]) of all denominators
	- GCF and GCD is generally a smaller number (GCF = GCD)
		- GCF of 2 numbers is the largest factor common to the numbers. For example:
			- Prime Factors of 10 are 2 and 5
			- Prime Factors of 15 are 5 and 3
			- Therefore, the GCF is 5 because it is the largest common factor common between both numbers
	- LCD and LCM is generally a larger number
		- You multiply by the most common occurrences of prime factors for the numbers you're trying to find the LCM for.

- So similarly when we work with [[rational expression|rational expressions]], we need to have a common denominator to add or subtract
- To find the LCD for a group of rational expressions:
	- Factor all denominators completely
	- List each different denominator factor. When a factor occurs in more than one factorization, list the largest number of repeats among all factorizations.
	- Multiply the factors to obtain the LCD

	- When finding an LCD, it's better to leave it in factored form in case you need to do some canceling later on.
