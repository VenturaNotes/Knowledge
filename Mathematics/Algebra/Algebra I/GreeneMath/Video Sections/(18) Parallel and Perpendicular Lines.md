- [[Parallel lines]] are any two lines on a plane that will never intersect.
- We can determine if two lines are parallel by examining the slope of each.
	- Non-vertical parallel lines have slopes that are equal
	- Vertical lines have slopes that are undefined
- Essentially looking for same slope, but different y-intercept

- [[Perpendicular lines]] are lines that intersect at a 90$\degree$ angle.
	- Two non-vertical perpendicular lines have slopes whose product is -1

## Determine if each pair of lines are parallel, perpendicular, or neither:

	- Take each equation and solve for y
	- Lines are parallel with same slope but different y-intercepts
	- Visual

	- Solve for slope-intercept form to find the slope and y-intercept
	- If the product of slopes equals -1, they're perpendicular

	- You can multiply or divide by "-1" to change the sign. Both operations do the same in this case.

## Write the standard form of the equation of the line described

	- Find slope of parallel line (in slope-intercept form) to get the slope
	- Use the slope found to write in point-slope form the equation which then needs to be converted to standard form (ax + by = c) where a >= 0 and a, b, c are integers

	- Need to find standard form of equation that goes through the point $(-4,-3)$ and is perpendicular to $12x+3y=15$
