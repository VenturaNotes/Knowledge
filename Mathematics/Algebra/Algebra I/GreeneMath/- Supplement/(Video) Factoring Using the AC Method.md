	- Factoring Trinomials
		- When we multiply two polynomials together, the product always has a higher degree
		- When we factor a trinomial, we break it down into two or more polynomial factors of lower degree.

- Factoring Using the AC Method
	- To factor a quadratic function $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, a \ne 0$
		- (1) Factor out the GCF (if there is one)
		- (2) Off to the side, multiply a and c together
		- (3) Find factors of ac that sum to b.
		- (4) Use the factors you found in step 3 to rewrite bx as a sum.
		- (5) factor by grouping
