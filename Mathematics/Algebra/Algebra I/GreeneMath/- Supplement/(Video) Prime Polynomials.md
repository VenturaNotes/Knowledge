- [[Prime Polynomial|Prime polynomials]]
	- Recall: a prime number is a number who's only factors are 1 and itself.
	- A polynomial with integer coefficients that cannot be factored into polynomials of  lower degree with rational coefficients is called a prime polynomial
	- Note: These polynomials may be factorable using irrational or imaginary numbers. We'll be doing more with irrationals later in this course, and won't be using imaginary numbers

- How to determine if a polynomial is prime
	- When attempting to factor a polynomial using the [[(Video) Factoring Using the AC Method|AC method]], if no factors of ac sum to b, the polynomial is prime
	- Ex) Factor $x^2 + 100$
		- Cannot factor this into polynomials of lower degree with rational coefficients

- More example. Factor
- No factors of "ac" sum to "b" so the polynomials are prime
