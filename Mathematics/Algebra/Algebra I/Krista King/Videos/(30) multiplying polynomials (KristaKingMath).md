	- Multiply the polynomials
	- Polynomials means many numbers
		- `poly` = many
		- `nomials` = numbers
	- When multiplying binomials together, use the foil method
		- Bi means 2
		- Binomials are polynomials
		- They are binomials because they each have 2 terms
	- Exponent tells us 2 factors of (5x-6)
	- We multiply trinomial by binomial
	- The takeaway is that you have to multiply each term in each polynomial by all of the other terms in the other polynomials in order to get the correct answer.
