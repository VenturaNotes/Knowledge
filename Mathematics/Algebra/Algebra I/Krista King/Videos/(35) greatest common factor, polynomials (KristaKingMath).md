	- Polynomial means many numbers
	- Can use distributive property to check your answer after factoring.
	- Look at whole number coefficients first, then look at each variable involved with the polynomial. Then pull out the largest number of factors of that variable that are involved in each one of your terms. Product of all those things will be your greatest common factor. Pull out greatest common factor from each of the terms in the polynomial.
