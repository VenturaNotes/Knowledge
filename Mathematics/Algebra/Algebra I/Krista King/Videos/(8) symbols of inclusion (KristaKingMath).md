	- Simplify the expression
	- Symbols of inclusions include (and in order)
		- parenthesis ()
			- Do this first (innermost)
		- brackets []
			- Do this second (out one)
		- braces {}
			- Do this last (outermost)
	- We use symbols of inclusion because when we have nested operations, parenthesis within parenthesis, we like to use different symbols of inclusion to distinguish between different levels of operations
