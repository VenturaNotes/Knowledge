	- Graph the linear equation
- Linear equation means that both variables are to the 1st power
	- Plotting it will always be a line
- "m" is the slope and "b" is where the line intersects the y-axis
- Any line that slants to the right (steep or shallow), these will be positive slopes
- If line slants to the left, these will be negative slopes and will be negative
- Can check your work by plugging in points on the equation and check if it's on the line. (chart)
	- Best points to choose for x are -1, 0, and 1.
- When graphing equation of line
	- Create a chart for coordinate points
	- or you could use the slope and y intercept
