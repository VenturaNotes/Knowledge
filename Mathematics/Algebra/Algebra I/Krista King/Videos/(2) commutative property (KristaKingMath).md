	- Use the commutative property to write the expression a different way
		- It tells you that the order of addition and multiplication doesn't matter. We'll still get the same result.
	- Even if we flip the order, the sum is going to be the same thing.
	- This works for addition and multiplication
	- Commuting the values $4*6$ to 6(4), we'll still get the same product
	- It does not work for subtraction and division
	- If you think about driving to work, going to and from work will always be the same distance if you go along the same path.
