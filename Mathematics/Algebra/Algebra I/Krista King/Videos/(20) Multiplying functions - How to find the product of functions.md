- When multiplying functions together
	- fg(x)
		- f(x)g(x) is also valid but much less common
	- f(x) = 3
		- A function f in terms of the variable x
- For fg(2) (both methods are valid)
	- You can multiply the functions f(x) and g(x) to get the product, and then evaluate at 2
	- Evaluate original functions at 2 first and the multiply results together to get the product
