	- Simplify the expression with PEMDAS (helps us remember order of operations to do the arithmetic)
		- Parentheses
		- Exponents
		- Multiplication
		- Division
		- Addition
		- Subtraction
	- Multiplication and division can be done at the same time
	- Addition and subtraction can be done at the same time
	- Need to apply PEMDAS to the numerator first and then to the denominator second. Then you can divide numerator by the denominator.
