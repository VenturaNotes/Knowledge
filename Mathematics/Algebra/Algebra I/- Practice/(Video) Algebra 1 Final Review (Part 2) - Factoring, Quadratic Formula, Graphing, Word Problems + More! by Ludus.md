	- (1) Factor
- ![[Pasted image 20230529171141.png]]
	- (2) Factor $g(x) = x^2 - 36$ and check your answer
		- [[Difference of Perfect Squares]]

	- (3) Find the zeros of $h(x) = 4x^2 - 4x - 3$ by factoring
		- You could factor a polynomial by changing it into a fraction

	- (4) Find the zeros of the following quadratic by completing the square
		- $f(x) = x^2 - 2x - 4$

	- (5) Solve for x by completing the square
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 7.55.17 AM.png|500]]
	- (6) Find the vertex of the following quadratic and state whether it is a maximum or minimum
		- This vertex is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">minimum</mark>. We know this because the coefficient on $x^2$ in the original equation is positive and so this is an upward facing parabola whose vertex would be at the lowest point

	- (7) Find the zeros of the following quadratic using the [[quadratic formula]].
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 12.25.45 PM.png]]
	- (8) Are the roots of the following quadratic real or imaginary?
		- Need to use [[Discriminant]] for this
			- Since negative, we get imaginary square roots
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 4.36.05 PM.png|400]]
	- (9) Solve for x:
		- Eliminate fractions by multiplying everything by 6  
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 4.53.49 PM.png|400]]
	- (10) Is $\sqrt{28}$ an irrational #? Is 0.$\overline {3}$ rational? Justify your answers?
		- [[Rational Numbers]] can be displayed as a ratio of two integers ^07b61b
	- So, you don't have to know that decimal is equal to $\frac 13$
	- The point is that there is a pattern (it repeats), so it's rational
	- A fraction is a ratio

	- (11) Put the square root of 60, and the cube root of 16 into simplest radical form.
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 4.57.29 PM.png]]
	- (12) Which of the following graphs corresponds to $f(x) = \sqrt{x + 2} + 1$
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 5.02.01 PM.png]]
	- (13) Graph
		- Used completing the square
			- Used the [[vertex form]]
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 5.05.04 PM.png]]
	- (14) Graph $f(x) = 2^x - 5$ below 
		- Just found points, plotted them, and then connected them.
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 5.08.24 PM.png]]
	- (15) The graph of a function j(x) is shown below. The points A(-5, 0), B(-3,2) and C(-1, 0) all lie on this graph. Which point(s) is/are at the zero(s) of this graph?
		- A and C are the zeros
		- B is the vertex

	- (17) Which two properties are being used to get from step 1 to step 2?
		- [[Commutative Property]]
		- [[Distributive Property]]
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 5.17.14 PM.png]]
	- (18) Demonstrate the [[associative property]] and the [[identity property of multiplication]] below
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 5.19.25 PM.png|500]]
	- (19) Solve this system of linear equations using the [[substitution method]].
		- Plugging in some function
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 5.22.26 PM.png|500]]
	- (20) Solve this system of linear equations using the [[elimination method]]
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-31 at 5.25.41 PM.png|500]]
	- (21) Solve this [[system of linear equations]]
		- Elimination method looks easier here
	- When 0 = 0, it means you have infinite solutions
		- It means both equations have the same line

	- (22) One of my subscribers wants to buy my online courses (coming soon) and support me on Patreon. My online courses cost $100 each. In one year, this subscriber buys 2 of my online courses and supports me on Patreon every month; all together spending $500
		- How much money per month did they donate to me on Patreon?

	- (23) I threw a ball into the air because I wanted to assign this math problem. The height of this ball can be modeled by $h(t) = -3t^2-4t+7$ where t is the time elapsed in seconds. In this function, what does 7 represent? Does this parabola open upward or downward
		- 7 represents the initial height of the ball
		- The parabola opens downward because the coefficient on $x^2$ is negative, which represents a reflection about the x-axis

	- (25) You are playing Minecraft because you're actually cool. On the first day of playing Minecraft you decide to build a tower, and you place down 10 blocks. On the next day, you place down another 5 blocks, and you continue to place down 5 blocks everyday after that. How many blocks have you placed after 30 days?
