	- Parabolas either in form
		- $x^2 = 4py$ (vertex centered at origin)
			- If p is positive, it opens up
			- If p is negative, it opens down
			- $(x-h)^2 = 4p(y-k)$ for shifting
		- $y^2 = 4px$ (vertex centered at origin)
			- If p is positive, it opens right
			- If p is negative, it opens left
			- $(y-h)^2 = 4p(x-k)$ for shifting
	- A parabola is the set of all points that are equidistant to a point called the focus and a line called the directrix
		- The distance from the vertex to the focus and the distance from the directrix to the vertex is the same. (this is the focal distance or the p value in our equation)
		- At level of the focus, the width is equal to 4p
