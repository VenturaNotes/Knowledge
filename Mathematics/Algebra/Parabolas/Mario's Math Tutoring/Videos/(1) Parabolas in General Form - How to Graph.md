	- x-coordinate of vertex of a parabola in standard form is found by doing $\frac {-b}{2a}$
		- Also the equation for the axis of symmetry
	- The $y = ax^2$ part is called the "parent function"
		- Gives shape of graph whether its wide, narrow, opening up or opening down
	- You can make a table and just use the "parent function" to find the coordinates with respect to the vertex found
