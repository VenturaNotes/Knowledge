	- R.E. stands for rational expression
	- If the denominator simplifies with the numerator, then we don't need to worry when that quantity equals 0. 
		- Since (x-1) cancels out the (x-1) in the denominator, we don't need to worry about when x = 1
			- This seems contradictory

			- Desmos clearly shows that the value for x=1 has an undefined y-coordinate but it's different from when x=1.5. Maybe the difference will be more prominent in later lessons
			- Maybe the answer is different because x=1.5 doesn't exist at all?
			- This is the graph if x = 2. Then x=1.5 and x=1 are both undefined.
