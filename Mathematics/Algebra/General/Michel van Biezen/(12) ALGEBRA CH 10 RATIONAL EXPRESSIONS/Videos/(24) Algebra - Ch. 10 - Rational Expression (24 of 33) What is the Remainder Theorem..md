	- When $\frac {P(x)}{x-a}$ Then R=P(x=a)
		- [[Remainder Theorem]] tells us that if we have a polynomial of the variable x and divide it by x minus som constant, then the remainder will equal to the polynomial evaluated for x equaling the value of the constant 
	- Great way to figure out if dividing a polynomial will result in a remainder.
		- We'll have no remainder if R = 0
