- You simplify polynomials by adding like terms
	- But what are like terms?
		- Terms withe the same degree
		- or if more than 1 variable
		- Terms with the same non-numerical coefficient with the same degree

			- a and b are variables (also known as non-numerical coefficients) (they are coefficients or factors multiplied together)
				- a is the first degree and b is the second degree
			- The "c" has a different term in each expression
- Start with highest order terms
