	- (Bottom left is (x+4))
	- There is a shortcut for this problem (example top-right)
		- First term is multiplying the first 2 terms of both factors ($x^2$)
		- Last term is the product of the last 2 terms ($-6$ )
		- Middle term is adding the last 2 terms (-x) (will be in terms of x)
	- The shortcut seems to only work when the coefficient of x is just 1
	- We should always write it in descending order
	- It doesn't matter how many terms there are in each monomial or polynomial. You simply multiply each term in the first polynomial with each term in the second polynomial regardless with how many terms there are in each.
