	- Method 1: Substitution
		- Substitute into Eq 2 and 3
	- Method 2: Elimination
		- Pair up 2 sets of equations and eliminate the same variable.
	- Method 3: Determinants (Cramer's rule)
	- Method 4: Augmented Matrix (Gauss-Jordan Method of elimination)
	- Method 5: Inverse Matrix
		- AX = B
			- A is the coefficients of x,y,z
			- X is the x,y,z variables
			- B is the constants on the right side
