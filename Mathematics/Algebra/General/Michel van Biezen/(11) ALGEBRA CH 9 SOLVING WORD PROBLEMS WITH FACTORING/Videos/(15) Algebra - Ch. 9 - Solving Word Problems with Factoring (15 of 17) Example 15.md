	- The kinetic energy of an object is defined by KE = $\frac 12mv^2$ where 
		- m = Mass = 8kg
		- v = velocity (unknown)
		- KE = 3600 joules
	- What is the object's velocity in meters per second (m/sec)
	- An object has kinetic energy simply because it is moving and has mass.
		- Answer is 30 m/sec because "you want positive velocity"
