	- Note
		- k = velocity because 
			- the equation for wavelength is $\lambda = \frac vf$ [^1]
	- Parts
		- $\lambda$ = wavelength
		- $v$ = velocity of wave
		- $f$ = frequence of oscillations
		- $T$ = tension
		- $k$ = mass per unit length
		- $v = \sqrt{\frac T\mu}$
			- The velocity of the wave on a string is equal to the square root of the tension divided by the mass per unit length
	- Question
		- $v$ varies directly with the square root of $T$ 
		- $\lambda$ varies inversely with the f
		- a) Find the 2 equations of variation
		- b) If f = 600/sec when v = 1800 m/sec, what is $\lambda$ when f = 750/sec? 
	- $v = \sqrt{\frac 1 \mu} \sqrt{T}$
		- k = $\sqrt {\frac 1u}$ in this case.
