	- Seems like x just needs to be raised to some power
	- One way to can solve for it (look for a trend)
		- 27 $\overset {?}=$ 18
			- Here y value was greater than the x value multiplied by k
		- 27 $\overset {?}=$ 27
			- Here the y value equaled the x value multiplied by k
		- 27 $\overset ?=$ 40.5
			- Here the y value is less than the x value multiplied by k
				- Therefore, we would need to work with a lower power
