		- F is the force
		- m is the mass of the 2 objects involved
			- Varies directly with product of 2 masses
		- R is the distance between them
			- Varies inversely as the distance squared
		- To write this into an equation, we need a constant of variation (or proportionality) which is "k" in this case
			- The k is actually the universal gravitational constant
- Hooke's Law

		- The force (weight of object), varies as the distance of the elongation of the spring
		- Used k for proportionality constant
			- Negative sign because the displacement is in one direction and the force is in the other direction
		- The relationship is that "f" varies directly as "x" (how much is elongated)
		- k is the constant that's proportional to the strength of the spring
			- spring constant
- Einstein's Energy Equation

		- The energy when converting mass to energy. The energy varies past the speed of light squared. C stands for the speed of light so it varies as the speed of light squared
		- He needed a constant "k" which ended up being the mass of the object
		- The variation is the keystone of science
			- Relating variables to one another.
			- Relating different aspects of nature to one another
