- (a) y varies directly with the square of x
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 9.33.02 PM.png]]
		- $y = kx^2$
		- x is in the numerator (because directly)
- (b) y varies inversely with the square of x
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 9.33.17 PM.png]]
		- $y = \frac k{x^2}$ 
		- x is in the denominator (because inversely)
- (c) y varies directly with the square root of x
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 9.33.47 PM.png]]
		- $y = k \sqrt{x}$ 
- (d) y varies inversely as $x^3$
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 9.34.12 PM.png]]
		- y = $\frac {k}{x^3}$ 
- (e) y varies inversely with the fourth root of x
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 9.34.35 PM.png]]
		- $y = \frac {k}{\sqrt[4]x}$
