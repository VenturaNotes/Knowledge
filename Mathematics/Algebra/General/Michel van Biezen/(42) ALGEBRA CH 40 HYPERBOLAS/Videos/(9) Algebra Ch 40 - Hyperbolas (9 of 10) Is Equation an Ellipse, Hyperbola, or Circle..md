	- A hyperbola is when "$x^2$" and "$y^2$" are opposite signs
		- if y term is negative, equation will open sideways.
		- If y term is positive, equation will open up and down
	- It's a circle when the coefficients of "$x^2$" and "$y^2$" are equal and positive
	- It's an ellipse when the coefficients of "$x^2$" and "$y^2$" are different and positive
	- Center at origin for all shapes if no "$x$" or "$y$" terms
