	- 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + ... + n = $\frac {n(n+1)}{2}$
		- Adding n terms together can be evaluated with the above expression
			- Find the sum of the first n terms in an arithmetic series
	- $1^2 + 2^2 + 3^2 + 4^2 + ... +n^2 = \frac {n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6}$
		- Can find the sum of the first n terms of a series
		- (It's a polynomial expression so neither geometric or arithmetic?)
		- Sum of squares of n Natural Numbers Formula
