	- A geometric sequence is where every consecutive term is a fixed number times the previous term. The fixed term is called the common ratio
	- First we must find the common ratio R
	- Can check if we did the multiplication correctly by adding the sum of the digits of the product and make sure they equal the multiplication of the sum of the digits of the two factors

			- Steps
				- 128 is 1+2+8= 11 and 1+1 = 2
				- 3 is the value itself
				- $2*3$ = 6
				- Product Found: 384
					- 3 + 8 + 4 = 15 and 1+5 = 6
				- 6 = 6 so we found the correct product
	- It's not an arithmetic series because 6-3 = 3 and 12-6 = 6 and 6 $\ne$ 3
