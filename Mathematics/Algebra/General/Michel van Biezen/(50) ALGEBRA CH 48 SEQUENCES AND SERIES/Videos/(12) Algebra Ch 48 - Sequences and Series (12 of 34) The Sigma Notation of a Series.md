	- A series is the sum of the terms of a sequence.
	- In $\Sigma_{i=1}^{5}i$
		- Limits are inclusive
			- 5: upper limit
			- i=1: Lower limit and increases in integer format
		- Sum is always going to end up at a particular number (when you deal with a series, you end up with a single result typically when adding up all the terms. It's the sum)
