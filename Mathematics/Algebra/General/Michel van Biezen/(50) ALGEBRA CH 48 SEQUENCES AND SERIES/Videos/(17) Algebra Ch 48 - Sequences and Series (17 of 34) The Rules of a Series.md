	- Rules
		- (1) When you have a constant multiplied by $a_i$, you can "factor" the c out of the series.
		- (2) Sum of constant is number of terms "n" multiplied by the constant "c": nc
		- (3) If you have the sum of $a_i + b_i$, for i from 1 to n, you can separate them and write them as 2 separate sums
			- Great for simplifying
	- $\Sigma_{i=1}^{n}c$
		- Read as "the sum from i=1 to n of a constant"
