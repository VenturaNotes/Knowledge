	- A Projectile is launched upward with an initial speed of 50m/sec
		- (a) Height at t = 3 sec
			- To find this height, we use the equation of kinematics (motion): $X = X_0 + V_0t + \frac 12 gt^2$
				- $\frac 12 g = \frac 12 (9.8 m/sec^2) = 4.9 m/sec^2$
			- The equation of kinematics (motion) is: X = Xo + Vo t + (1/2) g t^2 (1/2)g = (1/2) (9.8 m/sec^2) = 4.9 m/sec^2
		- (b) Maximum height = ?
			- Need to solve for part (c) first. When we find half the time, then we know the highest point of the projectile.
		- (c) total time in air = ?
