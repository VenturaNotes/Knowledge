	- Using the quadratic formula, $b^2-4ac$ = The [[Discriminant]] (can be represented as "D")
	- But what is the significance?
		- If $b^2 - 4ac > 0$, 2 real solutions
			- Crosses x-axis twice
		- If $b^2 - 4ac = 0$, 1 real solutions
			- Touches the x-axis at one point
		- If $b^2 - 4ac < 0$, No Real solution (2 imaginary solutions)
			- Parabola will never touch the x-axis (but taking the mirror image will have cross the x-axis twice )
