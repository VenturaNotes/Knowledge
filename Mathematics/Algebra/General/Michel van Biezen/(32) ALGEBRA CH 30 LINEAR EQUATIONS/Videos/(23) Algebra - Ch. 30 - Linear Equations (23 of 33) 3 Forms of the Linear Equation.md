	- 2 special cases
		- x = c (vertical line)
		- y = c (horizontal line)
	- Slope Intercept
		- We don't really need to know point slope form knowing this
	- General Form
		- x-intercept
		- y-intercept
	- Point Slope Form (don't need this form)
		- Just need a slope and 1 point on line to come up with equation of this form
		- When doing let($x_2,y_2$) $\rightarrow$ (x, y), this just lets us know what the general form is
			- Read as "General Point x,y"
