	- Given
		- y-intercept and slope
			- Can just plug-in those numbers into the standard from linear equation
		- slope and 1 point
			- Plugin slope and find the y-intercept given the point
			- Substitute x and y coordinates of 1 point to solve for b (y-intercept)
		- 2 points
			- Find slope and then plug-in one of the 2 points to find the y-intercept
		- y-intercept + 1 point
			- Find the slope
		- 1 point + x-intercept
			- x-intercept will just become your second point and use the "2 points" method described above
		- y-intercept + x-intercept
			- Use the "2 points" method again
