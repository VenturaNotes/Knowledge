	- It is an equation of 2 variables raised to the first power that can be written in the form $ax + by = c$
		- a and b are not both equal to 0
			- Only one variable can be equal to 0 at a time
	- When a linear equation is graphed on a cartesian coordinate system, it forms a straight line
	- The slope intercept form is y = mx + b
		- y is the dependent variable
		- m is the slope
		- x is the independent variable
		- b is the y-intercept
