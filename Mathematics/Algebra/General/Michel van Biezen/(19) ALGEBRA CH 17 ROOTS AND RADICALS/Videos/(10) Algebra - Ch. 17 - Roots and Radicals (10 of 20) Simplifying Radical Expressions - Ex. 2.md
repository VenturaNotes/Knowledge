	- This is what you do if the exponents inside the radical sign do not match the root number
		- When you don't have a perfect multiple of a root
	- Separate the factors that have a perfect multiple of the root from the factors that do not have a perfect multiple of the root. And then you can simplify a portion where you have a perfect multiple of the root in the exponents
- Error!
	- The solution to the equation on the right should be $3x^2y^2{\sqrt{3y}}$
