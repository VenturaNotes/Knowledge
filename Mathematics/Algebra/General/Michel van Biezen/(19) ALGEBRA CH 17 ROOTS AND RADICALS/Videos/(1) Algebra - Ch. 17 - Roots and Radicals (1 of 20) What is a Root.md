- Definitions
	- (1) Where a function equals zero
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 6.33.20 PM.png]]
			- Doesn't affect the concept of roots and radicals
			- When x = 0 or x =4, those are the places where a parabola will cross the x axis
			- This is what we call the roots of the equation
	- (2) A root of a number is another number such that multiplied by itself gives back the original number
- Square Root

		- $\sqrt {16}$
			- The $\sqrt{}$ symbol is a radical sign and the whole term with a number underneath is the radical
		- By Definition only the positive answer is used
			- In physics, you do need the negative answer. In algebra, you ignore the negative answer. 
- Cube Root

		- If it's a cube root, you have to write the 3
		- Negative answers are allowed with odd roots
- Fourth Root
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 7.00.54 PM.png]]
		- If it's a 4th root, you have to writhe the 4
- Can describe the roots as nth roots
