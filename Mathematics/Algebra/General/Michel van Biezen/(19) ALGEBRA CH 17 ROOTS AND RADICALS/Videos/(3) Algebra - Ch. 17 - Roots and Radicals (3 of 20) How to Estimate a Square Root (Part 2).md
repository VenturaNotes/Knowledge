	- The last digit of the square root of a number will always equal the last digit of the square of the solution
		- In $\sqrt {729}$ = 27, $7*7 = 49$ and the last digit of 9 in this solution is equal to the last digit of 9 in the square root.
	- Method only works where the answer ends with "5": 15, 25, 35, 45...
		- $\sqrt {225}$ = 15
			- (10)(20) + 25 = 225
		- $\sqrt {625}$ = 25
			- (20)(30) + 25 = 625
		- $\sqrt {225}$ = 35
			- (30)(40) + 25 = 1125
