	- When there is an imaginary number involved, it's "Not a real number"
		- It seems like you can represent a solution with an imaginary number as long as it's not a square root. Otherwise, there is [[(13) Algebra - Ch. 17 - Roots and Radicals (13 of 20) Example 2|no solution]]
	- The top right solution should be 64, not 16 since $4^3$ = 64.
