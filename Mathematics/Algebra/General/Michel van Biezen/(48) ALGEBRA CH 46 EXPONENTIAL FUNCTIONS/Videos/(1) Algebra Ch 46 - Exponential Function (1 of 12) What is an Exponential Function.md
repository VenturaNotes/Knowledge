- An exponential function is a function in the form f(x) = $b^x$ 
	- b = Base
	- x = Exponent
- Conditions
	- b $\gt$ 0
	- b $\neq$ 1
		- 1 to any exponent will always equal 1
		- Then you would not have an exponential function
- We think of exponential as something that gets bigger as x gets bigger
- b > 1

- Will talk about natural logarithmic functions in the future where b=e
