	- Peanuts currently cost $2.66 per pound. The price is expected to increase by 5% per year over the next six years. How much will they cost in six years? (yearly compounding)
		- Compound interest [^1]
			- Interest Compounded once per year: $A = P(1+ r)^{t}$
				- A = Accumulated amount
				- P = Principal (initial amount or price)
				- r = Interest rate (rate of increase)
				- t = time in years
			- Interest compounded n times per year: $A = P(1+ \frac rn)^{nt}$ ^e7835d
				- n = Number of times interest is compounded per year
		- Left equation is a flat rate increase (5% for 6 years all at once)
		- Right equation is compounded yearly where we have an increase on top of the increase on top of the increase
