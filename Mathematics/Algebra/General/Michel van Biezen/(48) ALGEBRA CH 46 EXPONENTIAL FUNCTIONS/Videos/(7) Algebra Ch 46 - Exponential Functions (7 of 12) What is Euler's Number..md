	- Euler's number is also known as the "natural number" and the exponential function becomes f(x) = $e^x$ or f(x) = $e^{cx}$ where c is a constant and e = 2.718289828459.....
	- e is a nonending decimal
	- The larger the constant, the faster the exponential function grows
	- Everything in nature grows according to that number
