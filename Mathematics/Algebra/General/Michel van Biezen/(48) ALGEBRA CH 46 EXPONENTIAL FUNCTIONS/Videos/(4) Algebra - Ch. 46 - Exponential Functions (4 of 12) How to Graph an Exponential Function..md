	- This is how you graph an exponential function that has some constant to the x power and a number in front (the coefficient). If the coefficient was bigger, then it would increase much faster. Coefficient is $\frac 14$ and the base is 2
	- Asymptotically to the x axis
	- Domain: x can be any value $\mathbb{R}$ 
	- Range: y > 0
