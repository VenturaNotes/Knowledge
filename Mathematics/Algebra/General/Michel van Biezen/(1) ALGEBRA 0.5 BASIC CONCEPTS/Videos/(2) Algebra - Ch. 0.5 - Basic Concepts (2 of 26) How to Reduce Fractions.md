- Whatever we do to the numerator, we must do exactly the same to the denominator

	- Numerator
		- Top part of fraction
	- Denominator
		- Bottom part of fraction
	- Example
		- $\frac {56} {60}$
	- Using Prime Numbers (helps reduce fractions)
		- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13 ...
		- as well as
			- 10
	- Demonstrations
		- $\frac {12}{26}$ = $\frac{6}{13}$ (divide by 2)
		- $\frac {50}{140}$ = $\frac {5}{14}$ (divide by 10)
- Two Methods
	- Divide top and bottom of fraction to reduce it

	- Take each number separately and divide by prime numbers as many times as possible ([[(12) C4--Factor Tree and Division Ladder#^0be61d|division ladder]]). Find the [[(28) Finding the Greatest Common Divisor#^048c69|largest common factor]] (or divisor) to divide by

	- Tree root method

		- You find the greatest common factor by either find the prime factorization list with the least # of occurrences for a certain number or to find how many prime factors each number has in common
