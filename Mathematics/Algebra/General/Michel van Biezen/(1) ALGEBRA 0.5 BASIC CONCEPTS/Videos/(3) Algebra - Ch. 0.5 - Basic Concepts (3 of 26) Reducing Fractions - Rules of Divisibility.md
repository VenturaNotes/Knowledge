- Whatever we do to the numerator we must do exactly the same to the denominator
- Prime Numbers
	- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13...
- Other Numbers
	- 4, 9, 10

## Divisibility Rules
- 2
	- Number is even (ends in 2, 4, 6, 8, 0)
	- Examples
		- 42, 36, 28, 40
- 3
	- Add digits ($\frac {\text {sum}}{3}$ ? then divisible by 3)

			- Can continue adding digits of number until it's a single digit
	- Examples
		- 123, 462, 927, 315
- 4
	- Ends in 00, 04, 08, 12, 16, 20
	- Add multiple of 20 to find if divisible by 4

	- Examples
		- 36, 84, 56
- 5
	- Ends in 0, 5 
	- Examples
		- 15, 315, 450
- 9
	- Add Digits (same rule as 3 but needs check if it's divisible by 9)

- 10
	- Must end in 0
	- Examples
		- 50, 200, 3000, 4150
- 11
	- If # is 2 digits, they need to be the same
	- If # is 3 digits, the sum of the first and last digit equals the middle digit
