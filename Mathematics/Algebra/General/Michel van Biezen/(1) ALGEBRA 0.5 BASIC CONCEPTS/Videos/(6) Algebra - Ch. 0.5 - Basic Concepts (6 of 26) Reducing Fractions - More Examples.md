	- Sometimes you can and can't divide by 10
	- We could just cross out the 0s without dividing by 10
	- When checking if $3*667 = 2001$, you can mentally do the math
		- $3 \times 600$ = 1800
		- $3 \times 60$ = 180
		- $3 \times$ 7 = 21
		- 1800 + 180 = 1980 + 21 = 2001
		- Could use long division as well to check
