- We need scientific notation to express numbers that are very large or very small
- Examples
	- $N_A$ = Avogadro's Number = 602, 200, 000, 000, 000, 000, 000, 00 = $6.022 \times 10^{23}$ 
	- C = Speed of light = 300,000,000 m/sec = $3 \times 10^8 m/sec$ 
	- Frequence of visible light = f = 600,000,000,000,000 Hz = $6\times 10^{14}$ Hz
	- $a_0$ = Radius of hydrogen atom = 0.000 000 000 0529m = $5.29 \times 10^{-11}m$
- It makes writing and reading the number much easier
