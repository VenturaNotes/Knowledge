	- (1) If we multiply and the bases are the same, we add the exponents
	- (2) If we divide, we subtract exponents. Bases must be the same in each case
	- (3) Exponent to an exponent means you multiply the exponents
	- (4) and (5) A negative exponent is the same as 1/positive exponent. Inverse is true too
	- (6) Any number raised to the 0th exponent is 1.
		- $0^0$ power is a special event
	- (7) and (8) A power is distributed among factors inside parentheses if simplified. Same goes for when they're divided.
	- (9) If an exponent surrounds a fraction, finding the inverse of that fraction will give the opposite exponent
	- (10) and (11) Number in denominator is the root and the number in the numerator will be the exponent of the number inside the radical
	- (12) Negative symbol in front of a variable is not affected by the exponent.
	- (13) The exponent represents the number of 0s after the 1
	- (14) Fractional exponents can be converted to a fraction to get a radical
	- (15) Can take a number and create addends from them.
