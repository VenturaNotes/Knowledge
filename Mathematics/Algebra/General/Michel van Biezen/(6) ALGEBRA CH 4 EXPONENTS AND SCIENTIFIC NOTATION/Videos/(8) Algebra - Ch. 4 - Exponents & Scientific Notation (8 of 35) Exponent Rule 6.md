	- Any number raised to the zero power equals 1
	- Be careful
		- $-4^0 = -1$ because the power symbol is only acting on the base of 4. It does not affect the coefficient -1. So it would be -1 $\times$ 1 which gives -1 as the product.
	- Infinity is undefined so that it raised to the 0 power to equal to 1 doesn't make much sense.
	- I think writing $(-4)^0$ is the same as writing $(-1)^0(4)^0$ which equals $1*1$ giving 1.
