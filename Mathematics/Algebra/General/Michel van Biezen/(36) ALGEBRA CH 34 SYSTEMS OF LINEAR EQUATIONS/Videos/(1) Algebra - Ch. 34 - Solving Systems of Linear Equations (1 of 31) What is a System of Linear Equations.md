	- Linear Equation $\rightarrow$ Defined by the equation y = mx + b (straight line)
	- A system of linear equations (have 2 or more equations)
		- EQ 1 
			- $y = m_1x + b_1$
		- EQ 2
			- They each have a unique slope and y-intercept (typically)
	- If the 2 slopes are different, the 2 lines will intersect
	- Point of intersection
	- A negative rise means a negative slope
