	- Get rid of decimals and fractions first to make problem a little easier
	- Used substitution here
	- When checking your work, best to use the original equation to check your answer
		- If you used the second equation to find y using x, checking the solution against the second equation could show you have the correct x, y values even if it's wrong. Best bet is to check the solution against the other equation that wasn't used to find the value of y
	- Don't use the altered first equation when checking your work (as you may make a mistake altering it)
