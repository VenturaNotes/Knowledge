	- In matrix A, A is the numerical coefficients of the x and y variables when they're placed in that format.
	- B matrix will be the constants on the right side of the equal sign
	- In AX = B
		- $X$ (with lines at top and bottom) represents the matrix with all the unknown variables (in this case x and y)
		- The A matrix multiplied by the x, y matrix is equal to the B matrix
	- In order to find the inverse of a matrix, interchange "a" and "d". Then place negative signs in front of "b" and "c". Then multiply that by 1 over the determinant
	- Formula for determinant
		- ad - bc
	- Method 1 of finding the inverse of a matrix
