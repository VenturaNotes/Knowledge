	- (1) First determine fraction of the job done per hour
		- 12 hours to do the whole job => $\frac {1}{12}$ Job done in 1 hour
	- (2) Determine the Rate (of doing work)
		- Rate = $\frac {1 \text{ job}} {12 \text{ hours}}$ = $\frac {\frac{1}{12} \text{ job}} {\text{ hour}}$  
	- (3) Fraction of work done by each = Rate x Time = $R_1t_1$ 
		- $R_1$ = Rate of person 1
		- $T_1$ = time worked by person 1
