	- Multiple people working on the job, each working at a different rate
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">We need to assume that they don't get in each other's way and slow each other down</mark>
	- Case 1
		- All contributors work for the same amount of time
			- $R_1$ = Rate of $1^{st}$ person
			- $R_2$ = Rate of $2^{nd}$ person
			- 1 = The Whole Job Done
	- Case 2
		- Each contributor works a different amount of time
		- $R$ = Rate => If person 1 can complete he job by him/her self in 20 hours then $R_1 = \frac {1}{20} \frac {\text{job}}{\text{hour}}$
