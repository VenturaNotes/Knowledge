	- Region on x-y plane that satisfies the inequality
		- $x^2 + x - 2 \le y$
			- 2 regions formed in this example
	- Region on number line that satisfies the inequality
		- $x^2 + x - 2 \le 0$
			- 3 regions formed in this example
	- 2 solutions to the quadratic equation
	- Find the critical points by replacing the inequality sign with an equality sign and setting the equation equation equal to 0
		- Use test values in original inequality to see if it satisfies the inequality
			- x = 0, x = 2, x = -3
	  "An equation states that two expressions are equal, while an inequality relates two different values." [^1]
