	- (1) Put into standard form. Quadratic expression to left / 0 to right
	- (2) Change < or > to = and solve to find the critical points
	- (3) Identify the critical points on the number line
		- Critical points are the endpoints of the region that satisfy the inequality
	- (4) Draw circles around critical points
		- Crossed out hollow circle for < or >
		- Crossed out filled in circle for $\le$ or $\ge$  
	- (5) Test the regions to see which regions satisfy the inequality
		- Use numbers that are not a critical point
	- (6) Draw a thick line for each region that satisfies the inequality
	- (7) Express answer mathematically
	- Note: Change > to < or < to > when multiplying (-1)
