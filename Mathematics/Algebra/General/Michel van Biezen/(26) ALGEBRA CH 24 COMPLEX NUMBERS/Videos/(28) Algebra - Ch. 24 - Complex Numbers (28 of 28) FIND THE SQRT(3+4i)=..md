	- (1) The length of the hypotenuse for $\sqrt{3 + 4i}$ is 5 because $\sqrt{R^2 + I^2}$ which gives the Length of the hypotenuse = 5.
	- (2) To find the angle of the original expression, we find the inverse tangent of the opposite over the adjacent and we calculate 55.13$\degree$ 
	- (3) When finding the square root of a complex number, the length is equal to the square root of the original length and the angle is equal to half the original angle.
		- Therefore, the new angle would be 26.565$\degree$ 
	- (4) To Find $R_{New}$ and $I_{New}$, you would use trigonometry
	- And then you can solve for the length of the hypotenuse using pythagoreans theorem again, $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$
