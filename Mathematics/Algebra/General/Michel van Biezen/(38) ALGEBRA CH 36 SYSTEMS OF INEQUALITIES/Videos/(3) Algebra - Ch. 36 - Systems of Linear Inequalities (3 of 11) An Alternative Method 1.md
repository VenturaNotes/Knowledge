	- Quick method but doesn't work all the time.
		- By logically looking at the line, to the right and up will presumably be the larger number and down to the left will be the smaller numbers. Therefore, in order for the values of the variables to satisfy the inequality and be greater than 40 and 15, they should be to the right side of the line.
		- If a value with a negative coefficient appears, then this logic can make the intuiton a little more difficult.
