	- Take a system of linear equations
		- By changing the equal signs into inequality signs
	- Instead of solving for a point of intersection $\rightarrow$ Solve for a region in the x-y plane
	- (A) Find the boundaries of regions
	- (B) Find the regions that satisfy the inequalities by using a test point 
		- Use (0,0) if possible
	- It's cleaner to shade the regions that do not satisfy the inequality so that the remaining region thats unshaded satisfies the inequality.
