	- (1) Find the equations representing the boundaries of the regions
	- (2) Convert the equations into the y = mx + b Format
	- (3) Graph the boundaries
		- Straight line if greater than or equal to
		- Dotted line if strictly greater than or less than
	- (4) Find the points of intersection
		- Set $y_1 = y_2$ or
		- Set y = 0 and then x = 0
		- Note
			- This step is not necessarily required but will help you find corner points
				- "Which are the vertices of the feasible region" [^1]
	- (5) Pick a test point (like (0,0)) and validate the regions
	- (6) Shade away the regions that do not satisfy the inequalities (or the opposite if your teacher requires it)
