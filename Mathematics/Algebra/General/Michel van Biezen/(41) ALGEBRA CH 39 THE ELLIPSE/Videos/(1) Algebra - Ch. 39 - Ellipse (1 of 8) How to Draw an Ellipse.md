	- (1) Put thumb tacks into paper (behind paper should be a board or cork). Then you end up with a string such that the length of the string is longer than the distance between the 2 thumb tacks
	- (2) Attach the end of the strings to the thumb tacks
	- (3) Take a pencil and stick it inside the string and pull on it in one direction until the string is kept tight. Then go around with the pencil keeping the 2 ends of the string tight between the pencil and the thumb tacks
	- (4) While keeping tight, you make an ellipse.
	- Note
		- The closer the thumb tacks, the more the ellipse will look like a circle
		- When the thumb tacks are at the same location, you will be drawing a circle.
		- Points where the thumb tacks are is called the [[foci]] which is plural for <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">focus</mark>
