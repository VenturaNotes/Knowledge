- (1) To solve for sound in decibels (dB) the intensity of a sound = $10^-4 w/m^2$. What is the loudness in decibels (L)
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-20 at 5.27.37 PM.png]]
		- Loudness is typically expressed in decibels
		- When reading $10 log_{10}$, it can be read as 10 times the log to the base 10.
		- Numerator: The intensity that we observed
		- Denominator: Some standard base of intensity
- (2) To represent the amount of radioactive material that has decayed

		- $N_0$ 
			- When we started with an initial amount of n sub naught.
				- This is the initial amount of radioactive material
			- Side note [^1]
				- $\aleph_0$: is the set of cardinal numbers
					- This is aleph-nought or aleph-null
				- Could be pronounced N-sub-zero
				- N-nought or N-null if it's a a mathematical term
		- $\lambda$ is the rate at which it decays
		- t = time
- Important facts in physics, sound, and radioactive material where we need logarithmic functions
