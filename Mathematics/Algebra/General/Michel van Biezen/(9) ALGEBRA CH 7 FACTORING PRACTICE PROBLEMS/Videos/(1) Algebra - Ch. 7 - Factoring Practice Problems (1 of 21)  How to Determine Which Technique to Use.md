- (1) First factor out any common factors
	- Since all the numerical coefficients is even, we can see that we can factor out the number 2
- (2) Then determine the type of polynomial
- (3) Then determine the correct or best technique
- All the techniques of factoring are [[(22) Algebra - Ch. 6 - Factoring (22 of 55) What are All the Different Types of Factoring.|here]]
