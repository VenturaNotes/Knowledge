	- Solve: Find the value(s) of x that satisfy the equation
		- A = B $\to$ $A^2 = B^2$ 
			- This may introduce extra solutions that do not satisfy the original equation 
			- Note: Always check to see if the answer is valid
				- Especially when squaring
	- General approach is to keep squaring both sides
		- Left-most equation was not completely solved.
