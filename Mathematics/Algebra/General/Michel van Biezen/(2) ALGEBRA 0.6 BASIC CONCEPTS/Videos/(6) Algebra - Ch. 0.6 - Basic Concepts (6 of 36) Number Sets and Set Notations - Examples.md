	- {2, 10} $\subseteq$ A
		- This is true since this subset are elements in set A 
	- $\varnothing$ element of B?
		- "A set can never be an element of another set. A set can be a subset of another set but it cannot be an element of another set."
			- This seems wrong. "A set can contain other sets as its elements." [^1]
		- Also doesn't contain any elements in set B.
	- A $\subseteq$ B
		- False statement
		- A is a superset of B but not a subset.
- My note
	- Using A $\subseteq$ B is it's general form (always correct as long as all elements in A are elements of B)
