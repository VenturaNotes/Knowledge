	- We can put a grouping of numbers into a set notation
	- Assign a letter to represent that particular set of numbers
	- A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
		- A is the set of numbers 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10
	- We can also describe this set
		- A = set of all even integers between 1 and 11
	- Algebraic representation
		- A = {x | $\underbrace {\text{Is an even number between I and II}}_{\text {\large The Descriptive Condition}}$}
			- A is equal to the set of all x such that x is an even number between I and II
			- When we talk about even numbers, we imply they're even integers ^a9ef07
			- x is a representation for any numbers in the set
	- Symbolism
		- 4 $\in$ A
			- 4 is an element of A
		- 5 $\notin$ A
			- 5 is not an element of A

	- The set B contains numbers 4, 6, and 8
	- {2,4,6}
		- This is a number set with 3 numbers in it
	- $\varnothing$
		- This is the null set
		- It does not have any element
		- { }
			- "Null Set" can be represented this way as well
	- This is what is meant by set notation
