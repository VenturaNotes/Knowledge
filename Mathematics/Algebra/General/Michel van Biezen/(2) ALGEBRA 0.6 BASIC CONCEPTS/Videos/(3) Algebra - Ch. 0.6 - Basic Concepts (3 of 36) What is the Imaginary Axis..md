	- This is the xy axis
	- Representation of a plane
	- Point is represented by 2 real numbers
	- 2D-Plane
	- Cartesian Coordinate system we might call it
	- 2 numbers representing the location on the plane

	- Real number and Imaginary
	- These are 2 axes that represent numbers
	- Horizontal axis (real axis) represents real numbers
	- Vertical axis (imaginary axis) represents imaginary part of any number
	- If purely on the vertical axis, there is no real number, just imaginary part.
	- Representation of a single number with a real part and an imaginary part
		- Real part: 3
		- Imaginary part: 2i
			- Better to say 2 units away from the origin
		- $i = \sqrt{-1}$
