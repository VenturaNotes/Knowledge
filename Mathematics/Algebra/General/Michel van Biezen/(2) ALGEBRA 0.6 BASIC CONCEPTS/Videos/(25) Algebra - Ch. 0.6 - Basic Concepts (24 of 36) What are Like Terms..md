	- Add or subtract expressions
	- Expressions contain letters
	- a, b, c and x, y, z typically represent constants or variables
	- 4x and 12x are multiplied together so they're called factors
		- 4 and x are factors
		- 12 and x are factors
		- Sometimes we call the number in front of the letter a [[(19) Algebra - Ch. 0.6 - Basic Concepts (19 of 36) What is an Algebraic Expression.#^64069f|numerical coefficient (or numerical factor)]]
	- Can only add terms when they're alike
		- The terms are alike when the letter portions (letter coefficients) of them are the same
	- 3xy + 4$x^2$y
		- Letter portions (x) of those two terms are not the same because the first x is raised to the first power and the second x is raised to the second power.
