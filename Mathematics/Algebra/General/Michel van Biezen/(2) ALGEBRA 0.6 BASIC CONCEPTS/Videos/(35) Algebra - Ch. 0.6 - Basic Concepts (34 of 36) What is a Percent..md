- What do we mean when we state:
	- The plane is 60% full
	- I received a 90% on my test
	- He gave 110% during the game
		- Mathematically inaccurate
	- The gas tank has 20% less gas than yesterday
- 100% = The whole thing = 1
- 1% = $\frac {1}{100}$ = 0.01
- To convert from % to a number
	- 42% = $\frac {42}{100}$ = 0.42
- To convert from a number to a percent
	- 0.2 = $\frac {2}{10}$ = $\frac {20}{100}$ = 20%
