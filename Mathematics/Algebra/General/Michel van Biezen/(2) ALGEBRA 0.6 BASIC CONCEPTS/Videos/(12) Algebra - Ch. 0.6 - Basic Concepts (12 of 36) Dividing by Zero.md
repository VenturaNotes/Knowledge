- $\frac 50$ = $\infty$ 
	- Since infinity is not a definable number, there is nothing you can assign infinity to because nothing in the universe is infinite

	- This is an indeterminate form
- $\frac {\infty} {0}$
	- Indeterminate form
- If you ever say you divide by 0, just say you don't have a valid result
