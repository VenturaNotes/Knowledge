	- (Michel made a mistake by saying $\frac {10}{9}$ on the number line instead of $\frac {10}3$)

	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Real numbers</mark> can only be found on the number line
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Imaginary numbers</mark> cannot be found on the number line. The red dots represent these imaginary numbers

## How to Deal with Imaginary Numbers

	- We have the real axis which is a representation of the number line
	- We have a vertical axis which represents the imaginary part of all the numbers
	- If a dot is found away from the number line, it cannot be a real number (imaginary number)
	- Imaginary numbers can have real parts to them
		- a + bi
			- a is the real part
			- bi is the imaginary part

	- Above is example
	- 1 unit away from the number line in the positive direction of the imaginary axis. Real part is 2 and the imaginary part is $1i$ or simply i

	- Graph representation of quadratic Equation
		- Crosses x axis at 2 points (at 0 and 2). Therefore, it has 2 real roots
		- The roots are x=0 and x=2

	- Here, quadratic equation does not cross x axis (so no real roots). There are imaginary roots though
		- Draw mirror image of graph
			- This imaginary image crosses the x axis at -1 and + 1
			- Therefore, we say it has 2 imaginary roots (not real ones) at $+i$ and $-i$
