- Write as an algebraic expression
	- (1) The number of cents in n quarters
		- $25*n \text{ or } 25n$
	- (2) The sum of two numbers is 15
		- x+y = 15
			- This is actually an equation rather than a statement / expression
	- (3) The product of two numbers is 4 times their sum
		- xy = 4(x + y)
	- (4) The sum of a number and 3 divided by twice the number
		- $\frac {x+3}{2x}$ or (x+3) $\div$ 2x
	- (5) The sum of two consecutive odd integers
		- (x) + (x+2)
			- Parentheses are not needed but makes more clear visually
	- (6) The product of three consecutive even integers
		- $(x) * (x+2) * (x+4)$
	- (7) Mary is 3 years older than David
		- Let x = Age of David
		- x + 3 = Age of Mary
