	- $P = R - C$ 
		- P represents profit
		- R represents revenue
			- This is what you take in when you sell the item you're producing and selling
		- C represents cost
			- The cost to produce the item
		- If revenue > cost, you make a profit
		- If revenue < cost, you have a negative profit (loss)
	- $C = C_F + C_V$ 
		- Cost expressed in fixed cost and variable cost
		- Fixed cost
			- What it costs everyday to run your business even if you don't sell a single thing.
		- Variable cost
			- Usually associated with the amount of money it costs for the raw product to make each item
	- $C_v = C_1 x$
		- Can express the variable cost by how much it costs to make 1 times how many we produce when x represents the quantity produced and sold
