	- A 31-foot rope is cut into 3 pieces. The length of the middle piece is one and a half times the length of the short piece. If the third piece is reduced by 2 feet it will be 3/4 the length of the middle piece. What is the length of each piece?
		- Drawing a picture helps
		- There was a mistake in the video. It says -2 for the length of the third piece even though he meant to write +2
