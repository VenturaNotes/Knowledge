	- There were 20 more than 3 times as many adult tickets sold than kids tickets and 40 less than half as many senior tickets as adult tickets. If there were 650 tickets sold, how many of each were sold? 
		- To help, phrase it like this:
			- "There were 3 times as many adult tickets sold than kids tickets". Then just add on the 20 to the adult tickets
			- "There were half as many senior tickets as adult tickets". Then just subtract the 40 mentioned earlier
