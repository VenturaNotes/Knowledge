	- Direct Variation
		- Forms
			- $y = kx$
			- $k = \frac yx$
		- Linear
		- Constant rate of change
		- Proportional relationship
		- "With direct variation, the y-intercept is 0, so you won't have the "+b" portion of slope intercept form." [^1]
	- Inverse Variation
		- Forms
			- $y = \frac kx$ 
			- $k = xy$
		- nonlinear
		- Variable rate of change
		- Showing example in quadrant 1
