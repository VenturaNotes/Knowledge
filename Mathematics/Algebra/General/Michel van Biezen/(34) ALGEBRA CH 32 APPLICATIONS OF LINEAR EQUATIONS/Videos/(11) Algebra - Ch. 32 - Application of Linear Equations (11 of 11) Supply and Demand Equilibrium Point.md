	- Part of [[(10) Algebra - Ch. 32 - Application of Linear Equations (10 of 11) Linear Supply Equation|previous video]] but At $4, the demand will be 1 pound and increase 1 pound for each $1 drop in price.
		- Finding the equilibrium point between demand and supply
			- Where the price is such that the demand will equal the supply. This is where you want to be.
				- If supply is greater than demand, there will be a surplus causing the price to fall so the demand will increase.
				- Typically, the price will always change until the amount demanded is equal to the amount supplied by the growers/producers 
	- Equilibrium point is when 2.5 pounds per customer per week would be the demand if the price was $2.5
