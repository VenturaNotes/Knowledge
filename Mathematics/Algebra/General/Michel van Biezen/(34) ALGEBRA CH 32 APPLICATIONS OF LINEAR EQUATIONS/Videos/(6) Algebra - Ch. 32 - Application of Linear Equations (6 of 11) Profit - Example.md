	- A fast food restaurant serves burgers. The fixed cost is $300 per day and the variable cost is $1.50 per burger. Find the profit as a function of number of burgers served if they are sold for $5 each, and the amount of profit if 500 are served

	- Profit is the amount of money you have left over after making a certain amount of money from a business or venture
	- You will have profit if revenue is greater than the cost. You will lose money if the cost is greater than the revenue
	- P(x=500) = 
		- Profit as a function of x being equal to 500 is equal to
