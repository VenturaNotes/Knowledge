	- You are renting a moving truck at $80 per day and 20 cents per mile driven. Find the equation representing the cost for one day, draw the graph, and find the cost if the truck was driven 200 miles
		- x = miles driven
		- $C_F$ = fixed cost
			- Cost you have to pay every single day/month/year or whatever time interval you're given
		- $C_V$ = Variable Cost
		- C(x) = 80 + 0.2x
			- Equation representing total cost for this equation
			- $C_T$ also represents total cost
	- C(x=200) is a legal way of writing a value for a variable inside a function
