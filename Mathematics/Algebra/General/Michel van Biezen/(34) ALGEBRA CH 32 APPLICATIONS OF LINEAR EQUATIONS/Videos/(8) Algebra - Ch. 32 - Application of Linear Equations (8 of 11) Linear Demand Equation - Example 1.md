	- If the price of tomatoes is $4/pound, the demand is 1 pound per customer per week. For each decrease of $1 per pound, the demand increases by 1 pound. Find the equation and graph.
		- Sometimes the quantity in demand is represented as the independent variable and the price is the dependent variable. However in real life, it's the other way around.
		- The demand is typically the result of the price so demand should be the dependent variable and the price is the independent variable.
	- The demand equation tends to be nonlinear but the portion in the middle of the curve is nearly linear.
		- The price will never go to 0 and the demand will never go to 0 as well.
	- In real life, demand is a function of price but here we'll create an equation where price is a function of demand
	- "P" stands for price and "D" stands for demand
		- As price decreases, demand increases and as price increases, demand decreases
