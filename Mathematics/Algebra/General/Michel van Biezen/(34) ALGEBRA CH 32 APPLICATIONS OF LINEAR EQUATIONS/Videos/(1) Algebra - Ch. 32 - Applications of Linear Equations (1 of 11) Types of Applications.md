	- (1) Linear Depreciation
		- Purchase Price
		- Liquidation Price
		- Depreciation (lost Value)
		- Value changes over time in years
		- Depreciation in value of car
		- Time is independent variable
		- Value is dependent variable
	- (2) Linear Cost
		- Cost (dependent variable)
			- Cost to produce hamburgers
		- Quantity (independent variable)
			- Hamburgers sold
		- Total Cost
			-  fixed cost + variable cost
		- Fixed cost
			- Will be independent to how many hamburgers you sell
	- (3) Linear Profit (Revenue - cost)
		- There is a break-even point where the fixed cost overlaps the number of hamburgers sold
		- Fixed cost
		- Quantity
		- Break-even Point
	- (4) Linear Demand
		- Price (independent variable)
		- Quantity Demanded (dependent variable)
		- This is a great example where the x-axis is not always the independent variable
		- Demand curve tends to be a second order curve
			- A linear example works fairly well for a particular range
		- As the price decreases, the quantity demanded increases
	- (5) Linear Supply
		- Supply curve tends to be a second order curve as well
		- Quantity supplied is dependent variable
		- Price is independent variable
