	- (1) Identify the term with the greatest number of decimal places
	- (2) Multiply both sides by 10, 100, 1000, ....
		- 1 Decimal Place -> x10
		- 2 Decimal Places -> x100
		- 3 Decimal Places -> x1000
	- When solving for the 10.1, you could just see that $10*80$ = 800 and $0.1*80$ = 8 and 800 + 8 = 808
