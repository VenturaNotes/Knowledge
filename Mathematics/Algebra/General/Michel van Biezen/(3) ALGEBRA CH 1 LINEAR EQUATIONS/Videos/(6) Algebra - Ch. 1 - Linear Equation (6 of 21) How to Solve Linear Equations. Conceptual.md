	- By inspection, x = 10 is the solution
	- But dow do we figure that out?
		- We just move the numbers on the opposite side change its sign to isolate x on one side
		- Faster method to isolate x on one side

	- Could use the properties of addition and subtraction to solve as well
- Overall goal is to isolate x on one side
