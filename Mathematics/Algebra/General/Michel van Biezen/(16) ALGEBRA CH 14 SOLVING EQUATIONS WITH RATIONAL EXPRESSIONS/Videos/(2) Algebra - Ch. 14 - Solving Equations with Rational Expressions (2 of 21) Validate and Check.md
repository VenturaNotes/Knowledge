	- To validate, we need to solve for x where the denominator is equal to 0. If our solutions do not make the denominator equal 0, the solutions are then valid.
	- If we're asked what all the solutions to the equation are, you say $x= -4 \text{ and } x=1$ 
	- If you have the equation (x + 4)(x-1) = 0
		- Only one solution of x will make the above valid. It can't be both at the same time. Therefore we say the solution is $x=-4 \text { or } x=1$
