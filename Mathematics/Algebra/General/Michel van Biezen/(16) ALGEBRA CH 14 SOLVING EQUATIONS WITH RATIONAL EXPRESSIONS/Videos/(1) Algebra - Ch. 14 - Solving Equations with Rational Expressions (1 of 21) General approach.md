	- Solve: 
		- Means Finding the value(s) of x that satisfy the equation (left side = right side)
	- Steps
		- Step 1: Find the LCD (may have to factor
		- Step 2: Multiply both sides by LCD
		- Step 3: Move all terms to 1 side (if quadratic)
		- Step 4: Solve for x
	- Rational expressions are fractions
	- Difference of squares ($x^2-4$)
	- Factor the quadratic equation
	- For rational expressions, the denominator cannot equal 0.
