	- Linear -> x to the first power
	- Inequality -> Not equal
		- Greater than or smaller than 
	- Circle that's not shaded in means it does not include the number on the number line.
		- Could use parentheses as well.
	- $-2 < x < 7$
		- This is an "and" condition
		- There is an infinite number of numbers between -2 and 7
		- Parenthesis means "not the endpoints"
		- (-2, 7)
			- This is written as a range of numbers
	- Sometimes we can include the endpoints (would still be a linear inequality)
