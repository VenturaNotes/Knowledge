	- $A = A_0 + 2\alpha A_0 (\Delta T)$ 
		- A = a sub-naught, + 2 times alpha A sub-naught times delta T
		- A
			- Area
				- (surface area)
		- $A_0$
			- Initial area
		- $\alpha$
			- Coefficient of thermal expansion
		- $\Delta T$ 
			- Change in temperatrue 
				- These are not 2 separate variables.
		- So the equation means that when you have an initial surface area and when you heat it up, it's going to expand which will give us the new surface area.
