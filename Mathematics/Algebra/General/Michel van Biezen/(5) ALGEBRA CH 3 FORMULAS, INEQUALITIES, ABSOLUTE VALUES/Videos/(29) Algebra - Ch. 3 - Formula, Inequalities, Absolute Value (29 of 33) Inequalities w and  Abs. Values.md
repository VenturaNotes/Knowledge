- A great way to remember an [[Inequality with Absolute Values]]
	- |x| < 5
		- -5 < x < 5
	- |x| > 5
		- -5 > x > 5
			- We need to recognize that this is an OR condition because x cannot be less than -5 and greater than 5 at the same time. It's implicitly an "OR" condition
- As a side note, the absolute value sign is then removed when solving the inequality.
