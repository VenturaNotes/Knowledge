	- When dealing with inequalities, we're typically dealing with a range of numbers.
	- Full circle includes endpoint
		- Brackets also indicates an inclusion of endpoints
	- We can never write a bracket around infinity because it is an undefined number so we can't include it. It only goes up to infinity but not including it.
