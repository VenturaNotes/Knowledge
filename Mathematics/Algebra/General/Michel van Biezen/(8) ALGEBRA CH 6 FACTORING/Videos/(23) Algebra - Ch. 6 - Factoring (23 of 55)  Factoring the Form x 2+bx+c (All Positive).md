	- Start with finding all products of "C"
	- $x^2 + bx + C$ 
	- Looking for 2 numbers
		- Product = c
		- Sum = b
	- $x^2 + 5x +3$
		- Sometimes it's claimed that it's a prime so it cannot be factored. We found all possible factors of 3 and none of the factors would add to the middle term.
	- All positives when the trinomial has all positive operators
