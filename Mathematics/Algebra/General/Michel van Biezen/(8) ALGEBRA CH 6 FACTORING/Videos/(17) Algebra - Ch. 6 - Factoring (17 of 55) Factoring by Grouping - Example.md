	- You could factor out the "$y^2$ and $1$" but you could also factor out the "$x^3$ and $-4$" out first too for the right problem.
	- The order of operations for an expression in terms of addition and subtraction does not necessarily matter.
	- Correct Example (left to right)
		- 50 - 33 + 20
		- = 17 + 20
		- = 37
	- Incorrect Example (Doing addition first but treating 33 as a positive number)
		- 50 - 33 + 20
		- 50 - 53
		- = -3
		- Corrected Example (Doing addition first but treating 33 as a negative number)
			- 50 - 33 + 20
			- = 50 - 13 
			- = 37
