	- (1) All prime numbers are odd

	- (2) All composite numbers can be divided by prime numbers or composite numbers
		- Check for divisibility by 3, 5, 10
		- 3 -> Sum of all digits 762 -> 7 + 6 + 2 = 15 -> 1 + 5 = 6 (divisible by 3)
		- 5 -> Ends in 5 or 0 (ex: 35)
		- 10 -> Ends in 0 (ex: 2100)
	- (3) Know your prime numbers
