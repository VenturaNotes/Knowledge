	- Steps
		- (1) First put into the form
		- (2) Find the boundary line
		- (3) Solid line if equal to and dashed line if strictly greater
			- Make sure to label lines
		- (4) Pick a test point from one of the regions and test the inequality (both  lines)
		- (5) Note: It is easier to shade the regions that don't satisfy the inequality but check what your teacher wants
	- When testing line 2 in region $III$, we see that it does not satisfy the inequality so we can also shade out region $II$, because it still lies on the same side as region $III$ with respect to line 2.
	- Region $IV$ satisfies the inequality
	- The colored region here does not satisfy the inequality
