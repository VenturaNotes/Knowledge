	- (1) First put into the form $y \ge mx + b$ or $y \le mx + b$ 
	- (2) Find the boundary line change
		- Change $y \ge mx + b$ to $y = mx + b$ and graph
	- (3) Solid line if $\ge$ or $\le$ and dashed line if $\gt$ or $\lt$
	- (4) Pick a test point from one of the regions and test the inequality
	- (5) Shade the region that satisfies the inequality (then later we will shade the region that doesn't satisfy the region)
	- Note
		- Graphically representing it all
		- The colored in region here satisfies the inequality
