	- Examples
		- The function $y=x^2$ is a one-to-one function when the x value can only be positive
		- The function $y = x^2$ is not one-to-one if the negative x values are not excluded. 
	- When a function is one-to-one, the inverse of the function is a function
	- When a function is not one-to-one, the inverse of the function is not a function
