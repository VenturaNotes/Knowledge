	- $x^3$ is a one-to-one function because it's odd?
	- For an even function, the number of times it can cross the y=x line can be 0, 1 or twice.
	- Wherever the y=x line is crossed, both the function and inverse of the function cross at the very same place.
		- It does this because of the mirror image concept
	- $y=x^3$ means you'll have a max of 3 crossings?
