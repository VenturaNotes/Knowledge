- You are not done simplifying if
	- (1) The power of the radicand is greater than the root

			- The radicand is the item inside the radical sign
			- 5 is greater than the root of 3
	- (2) The power of the radicand and the root have a common factor

			- 6 and 4 have a common factor of 2
			- This is simplified to $\sqrt[3]{2}$
	- (3) The Radicand contains a fraction
