	- a, b, and c are constants
	- When a > 0, the parabola opens upward ^f61eeb
	- When a < 0, the parabola opens downward
	- To find the x-coordinate of the  vertex, the equation is $\frac {-b}{2a}$ 
	- When using the quadratic formula to solve
		- If $b^2-4ac$ > 0
			- 2 solutions
		- If $b^2-4ac$ = 0
			- 1 solution
		- If $b^2-4ac$ > 0
			- No solution (real)
