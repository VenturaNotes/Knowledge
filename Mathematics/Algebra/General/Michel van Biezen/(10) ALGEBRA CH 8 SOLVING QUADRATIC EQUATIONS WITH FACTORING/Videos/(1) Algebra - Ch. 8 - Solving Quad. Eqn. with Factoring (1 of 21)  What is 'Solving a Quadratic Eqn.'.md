	- Solving a quadratic equation means finding the "roots" of the equation which means find the x-coordinates of the points where the graph of the equation crosses the x-axis.
	- Y is the dependent variable and x is the independent variable.
	- Looking for the values of x that make y = 0.
	- Where the function crosses the x axis
	- We set equation equal to 0 because of the [[(2) Solving logarithmic equations by factoring#^11dbb8|zero product property rule]]
	- Drawing a mirror image of the graph can show 2 imaginary solutions (for a quadratic equation)
		- There is no solution to the original equation.
	- Only 1 solution is possible as well
	- Will use a method of factoring to solve for a quadratic equation
