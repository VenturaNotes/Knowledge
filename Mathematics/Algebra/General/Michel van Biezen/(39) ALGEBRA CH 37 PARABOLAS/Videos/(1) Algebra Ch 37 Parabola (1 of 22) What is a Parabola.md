	- A parabola is the shape of the graph of the general equation:
		- $y=ax^2 + bx + c$ where a $\ne$ 0
	- Equation for the axis of symmetry
		- $x = -\frac {b}{2a}$
		- It goes through the vertex
	- Parabola opens upward when a > 0
		- Vertex is at the origin when b = 0 and c = 0
			- Vertex sometimes written as $x_v, y_v$ 
			- Lowest point is called the vertex
	- Parabola opens downward when a < 0
		- Highest point is called the vertex
	- x-coordinate of the vertex is always $-\frac {b}{2a}$
		- To find the y-coordinate, just plug-in that $x_v$ into the original quadratic equation
