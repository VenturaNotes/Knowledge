	- Important to put things down in a systematic fashion to avoid making mistakes
	- In a 30-60-90 degree triangle, b is opposite to the 30 degree angle
	- $sin 30\degree$ = $\frac 12$
	- Relationship in terms of "a" and "c"
		- $a = \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}c$
		- $c = \frac {2\sqrt3}{3}a$
	- Relationship in terms of "a" and "b"
		- $a = \sqrt{3}b$
		- $b = \frac {\sqrt{3}}{3}a$
	- Relationship in terms of "b" and "c"
		- $b = \frac 12 c$
		- $c = 2b$
	- Using the pythagorean theorem to find values of the sides of this type of triangle
