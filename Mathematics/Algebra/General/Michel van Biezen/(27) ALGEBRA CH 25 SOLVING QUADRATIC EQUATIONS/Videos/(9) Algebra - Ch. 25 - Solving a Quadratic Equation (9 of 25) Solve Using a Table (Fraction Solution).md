	- If there is a transition between negative and positive (-4 and 5), it may indicate that there is a solution between the 2 values
		- When we cross from negative to positive (where the line crosses the x axis), there must be a solution. Sometimes it can be a fractional solution
	- The first term $2x^2$ will become much bigger faster than $7x$ meaning that the larger the negative number, meaning the sum of the 2 will always be positive when the $x \leq 5$
