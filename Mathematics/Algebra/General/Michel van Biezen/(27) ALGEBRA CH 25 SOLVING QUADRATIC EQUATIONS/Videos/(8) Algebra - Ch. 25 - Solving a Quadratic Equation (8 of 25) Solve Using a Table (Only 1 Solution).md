	- From 0 and up, we see that the numbers are just going up in a positive direction. Therefore, we know that there can be no positive solution
	- From -3 and down, we see that the numbers are just increasing away from 0.
	- Since the solution "-2" makes the equation true and its neighboring numbers consistently increase in value away from 0, "-2" is the only solution
