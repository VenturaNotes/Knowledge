	- We get ride of terms by using inverse operations
	- What about when exponents get involved?
		- We must take the square root of both sides
	- Square root always give two answers
		- $\pm$ referred to as "plus or minus"
	- Can't take square root of negative numbers like we can with positive numbers
		- Will give no real solution otherwise
	- Let's say for now that only positive numbers can have their square roots taken
	- Taking the square root of perfect squares
		- Good to memorize the first 10 or even 20 perfect squares
			- We can still take the square root of other numbers
	- $\sqrt 2$
		- Gives an irrational number
		- Can't be expressed as a fraction
	- Simplifying radical expressions
		- We just look for factors that are perfect squares
	- Other Types of Roots
		- The cube root of 8
	- $\sqrt[3]{27}$
		- What number cubed equals 27?
		- The only answer is 27 because $(-3)^3 = -27$
	- Squares and Cubes
		- Square roots
			- Can't take the square root of a negative number
			- Positive numbers have two square roots
			- 4th root has similar rules to square roots
		- Cube roots
			- Can take the cube root of a negative number
			- Every number has one cube root
			- 5th root has similar rules to cube roots
	- Other Types of Roots
		- Odd Roots
			- Cube root, 5th root, 7th root, etc
			- One real solution
		- Even Roots
			- Square root, 4th root, 6th root, etc.
			- Two real solutions

	- Comprehension
	- Evaluate and/or simplify the radicals
