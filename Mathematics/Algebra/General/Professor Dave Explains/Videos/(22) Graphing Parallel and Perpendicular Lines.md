	- $y = mx + b$ 
		- [[Slope-intercept form]]
	- $ax + by = c$
		- [[standard form]]
	- Parallel and Perpendicular Lines
		- These lines are [[parallel]]
			- They never intersect
				- Therefore, must have same ratio of vertical change to horizontal change
		- Parallel lines have equivalent slopes
		- Equations may be different but slopes the same
	- [[Perpendicular lines]]
		- Intersect at a [[right angle]] $(90 \degree)$ 
		- Same slopes that are [[opposite]] [[reciprocal|reciprocals]]
			- Flip term and sign
	- Write the equation of any line that is perpendicular to $y = -\frac 14x + 2$ 
		- One strategy involves graphing this line first
		- Any perpendicular line will have a slope of 4
	- Write the equation of the line parallel to $y = 3x +1$ and passes through (4, 4)
	- Write the equation of the line perpendicular to $y = \frac {1}{4}x - 2$ and passes through (-2, 9)
	- What is the opposite reciprocal of $\frac 14$

	- These types of questions are very common
		- For parallel lines
			- Plug-in the slope and then solve for b with the point given
		- For perpendicular lines
			- Find the opposite reciprocal of the slope and then solve for b given the point
