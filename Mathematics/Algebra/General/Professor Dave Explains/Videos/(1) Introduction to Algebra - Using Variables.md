	- Unknown variable "x"
	- Algebra uses <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">variables</mark> 
	- [[Variable]]: A letter or symbol that represents a quantity that can <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">change</mark>
		- These can represent just about anything

	- Arithmetic equations only contain numbers
		- $12 + 7 - 4 = 15$
	- Algebraic expressions contain at least one variable
		- $4x - 5 = 27$
	- This is an algebraic expression
		- 3x + 2
			- We can evaluate the expression for any value of x
			- 3x: means three times x
	- Algebra has real-world applications
		- y = 3x
			- y: total cost
			- x: number of cheese burgers
				- We just need to know how to set up the equation
		- Whatever number of hours of TV you watch, Bobo watches twice as much plus one hour
			- y = 2x + 1
