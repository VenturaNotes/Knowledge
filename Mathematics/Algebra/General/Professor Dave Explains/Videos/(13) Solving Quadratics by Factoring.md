	- Learning how to factor polynomials
	- $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$
		- [[Standard form]] for a quadratic (second degree form)
		- Where a, b, and c are integers
		- For what value of x will this expression be equal to zero?
	- Solving polynomials by factoring
		- We must learn how to [[FOIL]] in reverse
			- multiplying binomials by the FOIL method
			- expressing a trinomial as the product of binomials
	- When factoring, you need 2 numbers that multiply together to get "c" and 2 numbers that add together to get "b"
		- Listing the factors of 10 for given example
	- Can check work by multiplying through using the FOIL method

	- 5 and 2 add to 7
	- 5 and 2 multiplied to get 10
	- We used this logic in reverse to factor
	- Given $3x^2 + 5x - 2$
		- These terms must now go in specific binomials
		- Use the guess and check method for factors of -2
	- How does this help us solve polynomials?
		- If any polynomials had been set equal to 0, then the binomials must multiply to equal zero
		- If either binomial is zero, then their product is zero
			- Those "x" values would then satisfy the equation

	- We can plug in our answers to check them
	- Now we can solve certain polynomials by factoring
