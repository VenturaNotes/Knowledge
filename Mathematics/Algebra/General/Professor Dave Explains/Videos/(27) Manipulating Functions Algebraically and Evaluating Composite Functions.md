	- function f(x)
		- Can we plug [[algebraic term|algebraic terms]] into the function?
	- Manipulating functions algebraically
		- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
	- (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)
	- $(f*g)(x) = f(x) * g(x)$
	- Domains of both f(x) and g(x) are all real numbers except with division
	- Evaluating [[composite functions]]
		- $(f \circ g)(x)$  = $f(g(x))$
			- Read as "f of g of x"
			- This is not multiplication
			- one whole function is the input for the other
			- Using output of g as input of f
