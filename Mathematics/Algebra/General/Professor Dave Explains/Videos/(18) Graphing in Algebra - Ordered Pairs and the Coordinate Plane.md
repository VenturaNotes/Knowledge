	- We can manipulate and solve various algebraic equations
		- [[Factoring]]
		- [[Complete the square|completing the square]]
		- [[Quadratic formula]]
	- Need to know how to [[graph]]
		- Graphs are visual representations of equations that help us comprehend the relationship between two variables
	- Grid is called [[coordinate plane]]
		- Has an [[x-axis]]
			- Horizontal by convention
		- Has a [[y-axis]]
			- Vertical by convention
		- Has 4 [[quadrants]]
			- I, II, III, and IV
		- [[Origin]] is where the x and y axis crosses
	- Each point has [[coordinate|coordinates]] in the form of an [[ordered pair]]
		- Ordered pairs are represented as a pair of numbers within parentheses separated by a comma
			- x value and then y value
	- The [[line]] represents all the possible solutions to the equation $y = x$ 
		- The line represents the equation itself
	- In y = 2x + 3
		- x is the [[independent variable]]
			- Choose any number we like
		- y is the [[dependent variable]]
			- See what value we get for y which depends on the value of x for its own value.
	- The graph can tell us things about this system
	- What is the [[x-intercept]]?
		- (value of x when y =0)
	- For trickier equations, it may be easier to look at the graph
	- Graphing gives us a new perspective on mathematics
	- $y = 2x + 3$ 
		- This is an equation
		- this is a line
			- A genuine geometric object determined by all points on xy plane that satisfy the relationship
	- Math is multi-faceted is both incredible and useful
		- Variety of approaches will better allow us to solve a variety of problems
