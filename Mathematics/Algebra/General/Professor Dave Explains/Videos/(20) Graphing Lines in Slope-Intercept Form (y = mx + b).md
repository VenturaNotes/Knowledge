	- We know about the [[coordinate plane]]
	- Let's continue studying lines
	- Graphing lines in [[slope-intercept form]]
	- $y = mx + b$
		- m = slope
		- b = y-intercept
	- Any two points define a [[line]]
		- We can find the equation for the line that contains these two points
	- Steps
		- Step 1: Calculate the slope
		- Step 2: Plug into $y= mx + b$ 
		- Step 3: Plug in Some Coordinates
		- Step 4: Solve for b
		- Step 5: Write the equation for the line
	- Now we can find the equation of a line given the coordinates of any two points on the line

	- What happens if you're given a point and a slope?
	- If we want to graph the line, we just need to plot two points
		- The arrows on either side of a line indicates that the line will continue forever
	- These points can be
		- Two given points
		- An intercept and a point given by the slope
		- Points given by the equation
			- $y = mx + b$
