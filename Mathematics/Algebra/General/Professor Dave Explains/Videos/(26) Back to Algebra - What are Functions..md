	- Learned Algebra I, Geometry, then Algebra II in high school
	- Back to equations with variables!
	- A [[function]] is something that relates two quantities , an input value, and an output value.
	- The function computes the sale price
		- f(x) = 0.7x
			- "f of x"
				- f is the function
				- "of x" 
					- Means the function will operate on any x value you plug in.
	- Every input will have one unique output
	- Functions have to pass the [[vertical line test]]
		- A vertical line may only intersect the function at one point at any given time
		- any x $\to$ one y

	- If a vertical line intersects at two or more spots (it is not a function)
		- We can however have the same output for multiple inputs
		- There is no [[horizontal line test]] necessary
	- [[Domain (Math)|domain]]
		- the possible x values that can be plugged in
	- [[Range]]
		- the y values that the function can possess
	- If you had the function $f(x) = \frac{1}{x-2}$, the function would be undefined at x=2 meaning x=2 is not part of the domain

	- [[Domain (Math)|domain]]
		- Very frequently all real numbers
	- [[Range]]
		- Tends to vary quite a bit
	- The [[zeroes]] of a function are the inputs that will yield an output value of zero
	- Characteristics of Functions
		- The zeroes of a function are the [[x-intercept|x-intercepts]] on the graph of that function
	- Different types of functions $\to$ different numbers of zeroes
	- Evaluating Functions
		- $f(x) = 3x^2 - 5x + 2$  
	- Let's check comprehension
		- Fill in the blanks!
			- The set of allowed input values for a function is called the [[Domain (Math)|domain]]
			- The set of possible output values for a function is called the [[range]] 
			- For every unique input, a function will have at most one output
