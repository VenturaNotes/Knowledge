	- [[Continuous function]]
		- No gaps in the function
		- Any x value can act as an input, and we get all the corresponding values for the function as a continuous curve
		- Function can be drawn without lifting pencil from paper
		- True for [[Line|lines]], [[Parabola|parabolas]] and more
	- [[Discontinuous Function|Discontinuous Functions]]
		- Some functions have [[gaps]]
		- Certain numbers are not part of the [[Domain (Math)|domain]]
	- Function is [[undefined]] at x = 1
		- $\frac {1}{x-1}$
		- x = 1 is an [[asymptotes|asymptote]] in this case
		- As x approaches 1, f(x) approaches $\pm \infty$ (depending on from left or right side)
	- Functions can be [[discontinuous]] even without any asymptotes
		- jump or hole in function can cause this
		- $x=1$ is not part of the domain as there is a hole (but the numerator was able to factor out the denominator in simplified form of function)

	- [[Piecewise function|Piecewise functions]]: These are when a function is comprised of several pieces, and we evaluate the function differently depending on the number we are plugging in
		- Some functions have pieces
		- Each piece is evaluated differently
	- Checking comprehension
		- A continuous function is one that can be drawn without lifting hand from paper.
		- A function whose value will depend on different functions according to the specific input value is called a piecewise function.
		- Any function with a vertical asymptote must be a discontinuous function
