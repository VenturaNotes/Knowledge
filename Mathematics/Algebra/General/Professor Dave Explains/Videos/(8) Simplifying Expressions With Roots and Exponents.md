	- We now understand roots and exponents
	- Examples
		- $(6x^3y)^2$
			- Read as "six x cubed y quantity squared"
			- The word <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">quantity</mark> communicates the parentheses
				- distinguishes between whole term or set of terms undergoing an operation rather than just the last thing we mentioned
			- Do exponents distribute across parenthetical terms?
				- Not for sums or differences: (a + b)
				- yes for products and quotients (ab)
	- $\frac 23$ is like squaring and taking the cube root
