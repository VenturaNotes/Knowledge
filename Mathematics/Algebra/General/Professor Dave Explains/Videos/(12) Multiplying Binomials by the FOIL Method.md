	- We know how to add and subtract polynomials
	- Multiplying monomials
	- Multiplying binomials
		- The monomial will distribute across the binomial term
	- Multiplying binomials by the FOIL method 
		- We distribute each term in one binomial across the other binomial term
	- FOIL
		- first, outer, inner, last
		- Students will frequently mix up the signs of the terms
		- Think of the binomials as lists of two terms
		- Don't think about operations in your answer. Just list each resulting term with its sign
	- Multiplying trinomials
		- As expressions get bigger, we just have more steps
	- Trinomial by trinomial will result with 9 terms and then condense from there if any like terms exist
