	- We know the basics about algebra
	- x + 3 = 8
		- equation
	- Examples
		- 3x + 7 = 16
			- Typically do addition/subtraction first before multiplication/division when solving algebraic equations
		- 4x + 3 = x - 6
			- We want just one x term so we have to combine them
				- Subtract x on both sides
				- Combine like terms
			- Combine the numbers
			- Divide
			- That was a three-step solution
		- $\frac {3-3x}{4} = 3(2x + 1)$: Solution is x = $\frac {-1}{3}$
			- The denominator of one side can be pulled up to the numerator of the other side
				- This is the same as multiplying both sides by 4 (but simpler way of thinking about it)
			- The numerator of one side can be pulled down to the denominator of the other side
	- Algebra sometimes requires that you form a strategy. Just be careful as you perform each step
