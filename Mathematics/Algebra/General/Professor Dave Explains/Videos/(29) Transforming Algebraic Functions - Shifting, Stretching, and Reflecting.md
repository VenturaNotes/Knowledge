	- We know how to graph functions
	- [[Parabola]] example: $f(x) = x^2$ 
		- Opens in positive direction with vertex at origin
	- $(x+2)^2$
		- This is read as x + 2 [[quantity]] squared
	- Graphing strategies
		- Make some tables
		- Apply [[transformations]]
	- Applying transformations to graphs of functions
		- In $x^2 + 2$
			- "+ 2" acts as a [[vertical shift]]
				- Positive shifts up and negative shifts down
				- No table necessary
		- In $(x+2)^2$
			- "+2" shifted the entire function two units to the left
			- A positive number here will produce a negative shift
			- [[Horizontal shift]]
		- $2x^2$
			- [[Vertical stretch]]
				- Stretched by that factor
				- If [[coefficient]] < 1, it will shrink in the opposite direction
		- $f(x) = (ax)^2$
			- a > 1: [[Horizontal compression]]
			- a < 1: [[Horizontal stretch]]
		- $f(x) = ax^2$
			- a > 1: [[Vertical stretch]]
			- a < 1: [[Vertical compression]]

	- For $-x^2$, $x^2$ was reflect across the x-axis
	- For $(-x)^2$, $x^2$ reflected across the y-axis making no difference
	- Let's apply some transformations to $f(x) = x^2$ 
	- These transformations apply to any type of function
		- So given $x^2$ to $x^2 - 2$ would apply to
			- $|x|$
			- $x^3$
			- $\sqrt{x}$ 
		- We just have to know the basic graph and then apply these simple transformations
	- Applying Transformations to Graphs of Functions $f(x) = a(bx - h)^n + k$
		- [[Vertical shift]]
			- positive k = shift up
			- negative k = shift down
		- [[Horizontal shift]]
			- Positive h = shift right
			- Negative h = shift left
		- [[Vertical Stretch]]
			- a > 1 = stretch
			- a < 1 = compress
			- -a = reflect on x-axis
		- [[Horizontal stretch]]
			- b < 1 = stretch
			- b > 1 = compress
			- -b = reflect on y-axis
	- Not all functions can be graphed using these transformations
		- We will learn other strategies later
	- Checking comprehension
