	- We can [[factor]] [[Polynomial|polynomials]]
		- Not all polynomials can be factored
	- A technique that will always work is called [[Complete the square|completing the square]]
	- Solving quadratics by completing the square
	- $x^2 + 2x + 1$ can be factored into two identical [[binomial|binomials]]
		- it is a [[perfect square]]
			- Since it can be generated by squaring the binomial
				-  $(x + 1)^2$ 
			- Fact is useful for polynomials that can't be factored
	- Anything multiplied by itself is by definition that thing squared
	- 4 is a perfect square because it's 2 squared 
	- We can manipulate polynomials to generate perfect squares
	- When completing the square, it may not look pretty but it's the precise solution set

	- To complete the square, we take the 6, cut it in half and square it
	- The c term has factors that multiply to give c and add to give b
		- Cut the b term in half to get the number factored
		- Square it to get the new c term

	- When a $\ne$ 1, we must divide everything by a
	- Combine the fractions on the right side (by finding the [[Least Common Denominator|LCD]])
