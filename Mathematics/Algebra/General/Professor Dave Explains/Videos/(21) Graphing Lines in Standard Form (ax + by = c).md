	- We can graph lines in $y = mx + b$ form
		- Which is known as the [[slope-intercept form]]
	- We must learn about the [[standard form]]
		- $ax + by = c$ 
			- Great for graphing a line quickly
		- We can find the [[y-intercept]] by setting x equal to zero
		- We can find the [[x-intercept]] by setting y equal to zero
	- $ax + by = c$
		- Standard form is good for getting intercepts and quickly graphing the line
	- $y = mx + b$
		- Slope-intercept form is good for identifying the slope of a line
	- To find the slope of a line written in standard form: 
		- Could take the intercepts to calculate the slope
		- We can also convert the equation into slope-intercept form (just solve for y)

	- We can also convert from slope-intercept form back into standard form
		- Let's note that in [[standard form]]
			- $ax + by = c$ 
			- $a, b, \text{ and } c$ must be integers
	- These two equations represent the same line
	- A line in standard form should have a, b, and c in the lowest [[ratio]] possible
	- This equation can be simplified to get the other equation
		- $4x + 6y = 12$ $\to$ $2x + 3y = 6$ 
			- The second one is better
			- They will still give the same intercepts
			- Now we have two forms of equations for lines
