	- [[Slope]]
		- A line's rate of change in the vertical direction
			- Can be shallow or steep (like a mountain)
		- $y = mx + b$ 
			- y is independent variable
			- x is dependent variable
		- m = slope
		- b = [[y-intercept]]
			- Point where line crosses y-axis
	- Understanding slopes and intercepts
		- For y = x
			- Every point on this line satisfies the equation
		- slope = rise over run = change in y over change in x
			- $\frac {y_2 - y_1}{x_2 - x_1}$
	- Slope greater than 1 will be steeper
	- Slope is [[undefined]] when slope is completely vertical
		- Infinity over zero is undefined
	- Slope is < 1, line tilts downwards until slope reaches 0
		- Zero over infinity equals 0
	- [[vertical line|vertical lines]] have an undefined slope
	- [[Horizontal line|horizontal lines]] have zero slope
	- Everything in-between has some slope between 0 and infinity
	- Slope < 0 creates a negative slope

	- Slope is undefined when slope approaches negative infinity
	- Any two points define a [[line]]
		- All Lines contain infinite points
			- This is because the coordinates can become infinitely precise
	- We can draw a line between any two points 
	- We can calculate the slope of the line
		- $\frac {rise}{run}$ 
	- When calculating slope, it doesn't matter which is point 1 and which is point 2
		- The coordinates of each point must remain together though
		- One point and a slope can define a line
	- Slope is rate of change
