	- Algebra involves inequalities
		- Equality: x = 2
		- Inequality
			- x > 2
				- x is greater than 2
			- x < 2
				- x is less than 2
	- Examples
		- x > 3
			- X has many values
			- Represented by a number line
			- the open circle means 3 is excluded from the solution set
		- x + 2 < 7
			- inequalities are solved just like equations
	- x $\ge$ 5
		- x is greater than or equal to 5
	- x $\le$ 5
		- x is less than or equal to five
	- x $\ge$ 4
		- the closed circle means 4 is included in the solution set
	- Big rule
		- If multiplying or dividing by a negative number, we must reverse the sign of the inequality
	- Negative numbers get larger as they approach zero
	- Multiplying by a positive number will stretch and shrink the line
	- Multiplying by a negative number will invert the number line
		- This is why we flip the sign of the inequality
