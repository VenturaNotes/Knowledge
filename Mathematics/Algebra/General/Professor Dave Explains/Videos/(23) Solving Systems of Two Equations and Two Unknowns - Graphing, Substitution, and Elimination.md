	- We know how to solve equations
		- Linear
		- quadratic
		- Higher degree
	- What about a system of two equations?
		- Are there values that can satisfy both equations?
	- Solving systems of two equations
		- Method 1Graphing
			- All the points on this line are solutions to one equation
			- All the points on this line are solutions to the other equation
			- The intersection is a solution for both equations
			- If lines cross once
				- There is one solution
			- Parallel lines never cross
				- So there is no solution
			- If two equations are describing the same line
				- There must be infinite solutions
			- We are usually looking at systems with precisely one solution
		- Method 2: Substitution
			- Solve for one of these variables
			- Now substitute this value of y into the other equation
			- Plug x = 3 into one of the original equations
		- Method 3: Elimination
			- Substitution is completely valid but there may be a quicker way
			- Let's combine these equations so as to eliminate a variable
			- Can add or subtract
				- Sometimes we have to multiply one or both equations by a constant before we can combine them
					- Might need to find [[least common multiple|LCM]] of 2 and 3 which is 6
			- Can combine and eliminate one of the variables (such as the y terms)
			- Solutions can get messy
	- Solving systems of two equations and two unknowns
		- [[Substitution]]
			- Solving for one variable in terms of the other and plugging that into the other equation
		- [[elimination method|elimination]]
			- Manipulate one or both of the equations to combine them in some manner so as to get one variable to go away
		- [[Graphing]]
			- See where the two lines cross
				- Line cross once: 
					- one solution
				- Lines don't cross: 
					- no solution
				- Lines are the same: 
					- infinite solutions
