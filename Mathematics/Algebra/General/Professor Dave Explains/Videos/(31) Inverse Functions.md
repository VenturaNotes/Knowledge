	- We know what functions do
	- What about [[inverse function|Inverse Functions]]?
		- If a function gives you some number, if you then plug that number into the inverse function of that original function, we should get the number we started with
	- If a function = f(x), the inverse function is not $\frac {1}{f(x)}$ 
	- The inverse function is determined algebraically
		- (1) Change f(x) into y
		- (2) Swap y and x
		- (3) Solve for y
	- The inverse function must undo all of the operations from the original function
	- [[Domain (Math)|domain]] of f(x) = range of $f^{-1}(x)$
	- domain of $f^{-1}(x)$ = [[range]] of f(x)
	- $f(x) = (x, y)$
		- $f^{-1}(x) = (y, x)$ 
	- If f is the set of [[ordered pair|ordered pairs]] (x, y), then f inverse is the set of ordered pairs (y, x)
	- If we can't solve after swapping, then the function has no inverse
	- If we can solve after swapping, then the function has an inverse
