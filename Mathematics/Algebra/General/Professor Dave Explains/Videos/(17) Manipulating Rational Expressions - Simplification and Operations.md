	- Let's work with [[rational expression|rational expressions]]
		- Simplification
		- addition
		- subtraction
		- multiplication
		- division
	- Simplifying rational expressions
		- Simplifying often requires factoring polynomials
			- Helps cancel terms

	- Operations with rational expressions 
	- Dividing by a fraction is the same as multiplying by its [[reciprocal]]
	- Multiplying and dividing rational expressions is a piece of cake
		- Adding and subtracting require a [[common denominator]]
	- To add fractions with different denominators, we needed to find the [[least common multiple|LCM]] of the denominators
		- Many times, that would just be the product of the denominators
	- With polynomials, we still just get the [[least common denominator]]
	- Should FOIL the [[binomial|binomials]] since that would give a bunch of [[like terms]] we could then combine

	- The numerator can't be factored so that's as far as we can go
	- Subtraction works similarly
	- When combining numerators, make sure to distribute negative signs appropriately
	- We sometimes have to factor denominators to find the LCD
		- Will just be the product of all the terms in both denominators
	- Simplifying complex rational expressions (just means there are fractions within the fractions)
	- We don't like radicals in the denominators of fractions!
		- Just multiply be the root over itself
		- When we square a radical expression, we just get rid of the radical
	- What if the [[radical]] is part of a sum or difference?
		- We must use the [[conjugate]]

	- Errata
		- First problem should be $x^2 + 9x + 14$
		- Second problem seems to be incorrect in general
