	- [[Commutative Property]]: 
		- Only applies to addition and multiplication
			- The order in which we add or multiply algebraic terms is irrelevant
		- Does not apply to subtraction or division
	- [[Associative Property]]
	- [[Distributive Property]]
		- (a+b) is a parenthetical sum
		- What is the greatest common factor for these two terms?
			- Can rewrite each term as the product of its factors
			- Find the factors that are common to both terms
			- Factor the GCF out of both terms
			- Let's distribute the 3x to check our work
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">The distributive property works in both directions</mark>
				- Generates equivalent expressions

	- Changing the way they're grouped will not matter if we are doing addition or multiplication  
	- [[Additive identity property]]: Any term added by 1 will return the same term
		- a + 0 = a
	- [[Multiplicative identity property]]: Any term multiplied by 1 will return the same term
		- $a*1 = a$
	- [[Inverse property of addition]]: Anything plus its additive inverse will equal 0
		- $x + (-x) = 0$
	- [[Inverse property of multiplication]]: Anything times its multiplicative inverse equals 1
		- $x * \frac 1x = 1$
