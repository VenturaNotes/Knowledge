	- We must undo any operations the variable is participating in
	- We can do anything we want to both sides of the equation
	- Examples
		- x + 2 = 5
			- The inverse of addition is subtraction (so subtract 2 from both sides)
		- n - 4 = 17
			- Inverse of subtraction is addition (so add both 4 to both sides)
		- 4d = 20
			- Inverse of multiplication is division (so divide both sides by 4)
		- $\frac y8 = 3$
			- Inverse of division is multiplication (so multiply both sides by 8)
		- 4 - b = 7
			- We have to get rid of the 4 and the negative sign
				- We do the reverse of PEMDAS
					- We work with addition and subtraction first and then we do multiplication and division. That's how we get the variable by itself.
