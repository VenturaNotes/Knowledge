	- Solving [[Quadratic|quadratics]]
		- [[Factor]]
		- [[Complete the square]]
		- [[quadratic formula]]
	- [[Polynomial|polynomials]] have factors just like numbers do
	- [[Prime factorization]]
		- Take some number and split it up into factors until we are left with only [[prime number|prime numbers]]
	- Are there [[Prime Polynomial|prime polynomials]]
		- Yes
	- If we have a complex polynomial, it may be prime (meaning it can't be factored)
		- it could be split up into a number of different factors
	- It's not easy to tell whether a polynomial is prime just by looking
	- $x^6 + 1$ is prime
	- $x^6 - 1$ is not prime
	- We need a special test!
		- [[Synthetic division]]
			- Can be used to test whether a polynomial is [[divisible]] by a particular expression or not
	- Synthetic division is similar to [[long division]], but with [[algebraic expression|algebraic expressions]] instead of numbers
		- We can use this technique to factor polynomials if we know one of the solutions
		- Let's see if x = 2 is a solution. that would make (x-2) a factor
	- Top row will be coefficients of equation
		- Products go here
		- sums go here
	- A zero means [[no remainder]]
	- These are the coefficients of the polynomial that remains after we factor out (x-2)
		- 1, 3, -5, -15
	- What is left will be of a degree that is one less than the original polynomial

	- Let's keep factoring until we have nothing but [[binomial|binomials]] (and therefore all the possible solutions)
	- [[Synthetic division]] is the best way to solve tricky higher-degree polynomials
	- How do we know which solutions to test for?
		- We will use the [[rational root theorem|rational roots test]]
			- This technique gives us a list of possible solutions
			- Make a fraction
				- $\frac {\text{factors of the constant term}}{\text{factors of the leading coefficient}}$
					- [[Constant term]]
					- [[leading coefficient]]
			- Now make all the possible fractions
	- Let's start with x = 1

	- This can get pretty tricky for bigger polynomials
		- Especially if the rational roots test gives a long list of possible zeros to try

	- Checking comprehension
		- Use the rational roots test and synthetic division to find all the solutions to this polynomial
