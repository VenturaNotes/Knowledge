	- Working with [[Absolute Value|absolute values]]
		- |x| $\to$ distance from 0 to x on a number line 
			- [[Magnitude]] of a number disregarding its sign
	- Properties
		- Positive numbers are unchanged
		- Negative numbers become positive
		- This applies to all [[real numbers]]
		- Absolute values can be split up across products and quotients
		- Absolute values can't be split up across sums or differences
			- $|1 + (-1) | \ne |1| + |-1|$ 
	- When solving absolute values in equations, we need to split it up
	- How do we graph equations with absolute values?
		- The result is this v-shaped graph
		- Later, we will learn about how we can transform this and other graphs
