	- Understanding polynomials
		- $2x^2 + 4x^1 + 10x^0 = 0$
			- Expressions containing an unknown raised to a series of positive whole number exponents
	- Names
		- 2x: monomial
		- 2x - 1: Binomial
		- $x^2 + 2x - 1$: Trinomial
		- $x^3 - x^2 + 2x - 1$: Polynomial
	- Usually the biggest term is something like $x^3, x^4, x^5$
	- $3x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x + 7 = 0$
		- Exponents decrease in polynomial
		- Highest power present is called the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">degree</mark> of the polynomial
	- Degrees of polynomials
		- $5x^2 - 2x + 7 = 0$
			- Second degree polynomial or quadratic polynomial
		- $3x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x + 7 = 0$
			- Third degree polynomial or cubic polynomial
		- $x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x + 7 = 0$
			- Fourth degree polynomial or quartic polynomial
		- $2x^5 + x^4 - 3x^3 + 5x^2 - 2x + 7 = 0$
			- Fifth degree polynomial or quintic polynomial
		- Beyond this, we just say "$n^{\text{th}}$ degree polynomial"
	- $4x^2 + 7 = 0$
		- Not all possible terms must be present
	- To evaluate a polynomial, we just plug in a specific value for the variable
	- Solving polynomials ($2x^2 + 4x + 10 = 0$)
		- We could solve for the values of x that make this equation true
		- None of the strategies we have learned yet will work for solving polynomials
		- We can't combine $2x^2 + 4x$ 
		- We will learn a variety of ways to solve these as we move forward
		- The really huge ones are very hard for even the smartest mathematicians
