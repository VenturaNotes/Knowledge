	- We know how to [[graph]]
		- Graphing is just a visual representation of a table we could make by plugging in x values and recording all of the corresponding y-values or values of function that result
	- We won't always be graphing [[Line|lines]]
		- We must graph higher-degree functions as well
			- Meaning there will be x terms that are raised to some exponent
	- This is called a [[parabola]]
		- $f(x)=x^2$ 
		- Function goes to positive infinity as x $\to$ $\pm \infty$ 
	- For $x^3$, it grows even faster
		- function $\to$ $\infty$ 
			- as x $\to$ $\infty$
		- function $\to$ -$\infty$
			- as x $\to$ -$\infty$ 
	- Back to $x^4$ goes to looking like $x^2$ but steeper
	- End behavior for single-term [[Polynomial|polynomials]]
		- In $f(x) = x^n$, if n is [[odd]]
			- it is an [[odd function]]
			- ($x^3, x^5,...$)
			- Graph will resemble $x^3$ 
		- If n is [[even]]
			- it is an [[even function]]
			- The graph will resemble $f(x) = x^2$
	- The [[Domain (Math)|domain]] of a function
		- The set of all allowed x values
		- Frequently the domain will be all real numbers. For most lines and curves, we can plug in any value for x. This extends infinitely horizontally
	- Some functions have domains that are not all real numbers
		- [[vertical line|vertical lines]]
			- Only one x value in domain

	- $x=0$ is an [[asymptotes|asymptote]] of the function $f(x) = \frac {1}{x}$ 
		- A value is missing from the domain and the function will go towards positive and negative infinity as it approaches this missing value
	- The range of a function will tend to vary
		- Set of allowed values for the function
		- Horizontal line will only have one value for its range
		- Many functions have a range of all real numbers: $x^3$ 
			- $- \infty \to \infty$ 
	- [[Relative Maximum|relative maxima]] and [[Relative Minimum|relative minima]] of a function are a function's hills and valleys
		- Relative maximum: point where the function changes from increasing to decreasing
		- Relative minimum: Point where the function changes from decreasing to increasing
	- Let's check comprehension
		- A point where a function changes from increasing to decreasing is called a relative maximum
		- A point where a function changes from decreasing to increasing is called a relative minimum
		- If a single-term polynomial resembles $f(x) = x^2$, it is an even function. If it resembles f(x) = $x^3$, it is an odd function
