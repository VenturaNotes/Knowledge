	- x equals the opposite of b plus or minus the square root of $b^2 - 4ac$ all over 2a
	- $x = \frac {-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}$ 
		- Just plug the coefficients of any quadratic into this formula and get the solution
			- $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ 
	- There are similar equations for solving [[Cubic|cubics]] and [[Quartic|quartics]] but they are quite tricky
	- This formula is for any quadratic
	- If the [[discriminant]] is negative, then there are no [[real solutions]]
		- (only [[imaginary numbers]])
