	- [[Numbers]]
		- [[Real numbers|real]]
			- [[Rational]]
				- The set of numbers that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers
				- All integers themselves are rational numbers
				- Anything divided by zero is undefined
				- Can be expressed as either fractions or decimals and these forms are equivalent
			- [[Irrational]]
				- Can't be expressed as the ratio of two integers
				- Have non-repeating decimals that are non-terminating
				- No matter how many digits we see, we aren't listing the precise value
				- $\sqrt{2} \approx \frac{665,857}{470,832}$
					- Very close but not equivalent
				- $\sqrt{2}$ is a real number!
					- It exists in a real sense
		- [[imaginary numbers|imaginary]]: Roots of negative numbers

	- Numbers
		- Real
			- Rational 
				- $\frac {1}{3}$ has a pattern which makes it a rational number
				- In $0.\bar{1}$, the bar means "repeating"
				- $0.\bar{9}$ = 1
					- If the 9s extend forever, then there is no number that can fit in between $0.\bar{9}$ and 1. Therefore, they must be the same number
				- [[fraction|fractions]]
					- All numbers that happen in-between the integers. Infinitely number of them in-between each integer
				- [[Integers]]
					- [[Whole numbers]]
						- 0, 1, 2, 3
					- [[Natural numbers]]
						- 1, 2, 3
			- Irrational
				- $\pi$ = $\frac {\text{circumference}}{\text{diameter}}$
				- computers can calculate pi to trillions of digits and there is no pattern whatsoever
		- Imaginary
	- Checking comprehension
		- Rational numbers are ones that can be expressed as the ratio of two integers, while irrational are ones that can't
		- The square roots of negative numbers are imaginary
		- The set of integers starting with 1 and increasing is called natural numbers
		- All irrational numbers are real
