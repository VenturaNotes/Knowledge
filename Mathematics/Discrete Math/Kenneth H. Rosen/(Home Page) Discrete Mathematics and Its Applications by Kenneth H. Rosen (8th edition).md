## (1) The Foundations: Logic and Proofs

### (1.1) Propositional Logic
- “we must understand what makes up a correct mathematical argument, that is, a [[proof]].” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=24&annotation=PRJQ4VZ9))
- “Once we prove a mathematical statement is true, we call it a [[theorem]].” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=24&annotation=XF4WKPZP))
- “automated reasoning systems have been created to allow computers to construct their own proofs.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=24&annotation=S3ZZV5H6))

#### (1.1.1) Introduction
- “The rules of logic give precise meaning to mathematical statements.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 1](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=24&annotation=M8WMIPJX))
#### (1.1.2) Propositions
- The basic building blocks of logic is propositions
- “A [[proposition]] is a declarative sentence (that is, a sentence that declares a fact) that is either true or false, but not both.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=25&annotation=AZR8M8JH))
##### Example 1
- Propositions
	- Washington ,D.C., is the capital of the U.S. and 1+1 are true propositions
	- Toronto is the capital of Canada and 2+2 = 3 are false propositions

##### Example 2
- “Some sentences that are not propositions” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=25&annotation=AR4T5K85))
	- A question or command is not a proposition
	- x + 1 = 2 Can be a proposition if we assign values to the variable
- We use letters to denote [[Propositional variables]]. Variables used to represent propositions
	- Conventional variables used are $p, q, r, s, ...$.
- The [[truth value]] of a true proposition is denoted T and a false proposition is denoted by F
- “Propositions that cannot be expressed in terms of simpler propositions are called [[atomic propositions]].” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=26&annotation=G6ZQKS6Y))
- “The area of logic that deals with propositions is called the propositional calculus or [[propositional logic]].” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=26&annotation=BDNNP7NX))
	- Developed systematically by Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] more than 2300 years ago
- The methods used to produce new propositions from ones we already have were discussed by [[George Boole]] in 1854 in his book "The Laws of Thought"
	- Mathematical statements are constructed by combining one or more propositions
	- [[Compound propositions]] are formed from existing propositions using [[logical operators]]

###### Aristotle
- 384 B.C.E. - 322 B.C.E
- Born in Stagirus (Stagira) in northern Greece
- Father was physician of King of Macedonia
	- Father died when Aristotle young
- Aristotle was an orphan (as mother died too)
- Sent to Athens at 17 to further education (joined Plato's Academy)
	- Plato died 347 B.C.E
- Joined the court of [[King Hermeas]]
	- When defeated by Persians, Aristotle moved to Mytilene and tutored Alexander the Great, son of King Philip of Macedonia
- Returned to Athens to set up his own school called [[Lyceum]]
- Aristotle's followers called peripatetics meaning "to walk about"
- Fled to [[Chalcis]] at death of Alexander the great
- Died of stomach ailment
- Wrote three types of works for
	- Popular audience
	- Compilations of scientific facts
	- Systematic treatises
		- Logic, philosophy, psychology, physics, and natural history
- Aristotle's writings preserved by a student and a wealthy book collector discovered them 200 years later and issued in editions to preserve them for posterity

##### Definition 1
- The [[negation]] of p, denoted $\neg$p (or $\overline{p}$) is the statement "It is not the case that p"
	- $\lnot$p is read "not p" and truth value of $\lnot p$ is the opposite of the truth value of $p$
- Other negation symbols
	- $\lnot p$, $-p$, $p'$, $Np$, $!p$ 

##### Example 3
- Find the negation of "Michael's PC runs Linux"
	- It is not the case that Michael's PC runs Linux
	- Michael's PC does not run Linux

##### Example 4
- Find the negation of "Vandana's smartphone has at least 32 GB of memory"
	- Vandana's smartphone does not have at least 32 GB of memory
	- Vandana's smartphone has less than 32 GB of memory

###### Truth Table for Negation proposition
- Table below displays [[truth table]] for negation of proposition $p$

| p   | p   |
| --- | --- |
| T   | F   |
| F   | T    |

- Negation of a proposition can be considered the result of the operation of the [[negation operator]] on a proposition
	- “The negation operator constructs a new proposition from a single existing proposition.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=27&annotation=CK4T3529))
- “logical operators that are used to form new propositions from two or more existing propositions. These logical operators are also called [[connectives]].” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=27&annotation=2NUCUM3Y))

##### Definition 2
- “Let p and q be propositions. The [[conjunction]] of p and q, denoted by p ∧ q, is the proposition “p and q.” The conjunction p ∧ q is true when both p and q are true and is false otherwise.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=27&annotation=QRTVIE8S))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 5.43.21 PM.png|300]]
	- Truth table for conjunction of two propositions
	- The word "but" is sometimes used instead of "and" in conjunctions

##### Example 5
- Conjunction of propositions p and q
	- p = Rebecca's PC has more than 16 GB free hard disk space
	- q = The processor in Rebecca's PC runs faster than 1 GHz

##### Definition 3
- “Let p and q be propositions. The [[disjunction]] of p and q, denoted by p ∨ q, is the proposition “p or q.” The disjunction p ∨ q is false when both p and q are false and is true otherwise.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=27&annotation=XIF8AJ5A))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 5.46.50 PM.png|300]]
	- Truth table for disjunction of two propositions
- Use of the connective "or" corresponds to the [[inclusive or]]
	- Disjunction being true when at least one of the two propositions is true

##### Example 6
- Students who have taken calculus or introductory computer science can take this call
	- p = students who have taken calculus
	- q = students who have taken introductory computer science
	- p $\lor$ q

##### Example 7
- Disjunction of p and q from Example 5
	- “Rebecca’s PC has at least 16 GB free hard disk space, or the processor in Rebecca’s PC runs faster than 1 GHz.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=28&annotation=BDJV962Q))
	- $p \lor q$
- “the [[exclusive or]] of these two propositions is true when exactly one of p and q is true; it is false when both p and q are true (and when both are false).” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=28&annotation=LTBLFM4V))

##### Definition 4
- “Let p and q be propositions. The exclusive or of p and q, denoted by p ⊕ q (or p XOR q), is the proposition that is true when exactly one of p and q is true and is false otherwise.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=28&annotation=L9G85I7N))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10.32.38 PM.png|300]]
	- Truth Table

###### George Boole
- 1815 - 1864
- Born in Lincoln, England
- Important mathematician of the 1800s
- Made discoveries in the calculus of variations (branch of analysis dealing with finding curves and surfaces by optimizing certain parameters)
- “In 1848 Boole published The Mathematical Analysis of Logic,” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=28&annotation=2MSMWKAC))
- “In 1854 he published The Laws of Thought, his most famous work.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=28&annotation=IU8J555V))
- Introduced what is now called [[Boolean algebra]]
- Died from pneumonia

##### Example 8
- ““A student can have soup or salad, but not both, with dinner.” Note that this is often stated as “A student can have soup or a salad with dinner,” without explicitly stating that taking both is not permitted.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=29&annotation=Z5CB3V4J))
	- Exclusive or

##### Example 9
- When stating: ““I will use all my savings to travel to Europe or to buy an electric car”” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=29&annotation=5W24QGIZ)). We know this to be an exclusive or. “This is clear because either option requires all his savings.) Hence, this statement can be expressed as p ⊕ q.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=29&annotation=2BEAA37L))

#### (1.1.3) Conditional Statements

##### Definition 5
- “The conditional statement p → q is the proposition “if p, then q.” The conditional statement p → q is false when p is true and q is false, and true otherwise. In the conditional statement p → q, p is called the hypothesis (or [[antecedent]] or premise) and q is called the [[conclusion]] (or consequence).” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=29&annotation=98V8KB4P))
	- "The antecedent is not a premise, and the consequent is not a conclusion" [^1]
	- “The statement p → q is called a conditional statement because p → q asserts that q is true Assessment on the condition that p holds. A conditional statement is also called an [[Implication]].” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=29&annotation=6H3LBVPB))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-09 at 10.47.32 PM.png|400]]
	- Truth table of implication
-  Ways to express implication / conditional statement
	- "if p, then q"
	- "if p, q"
	- "p is sufficient for q"
	- "q if p"
	- "q when p"
	- "a necessary condition for p is q"
	- "q unless $\lnot$p" ^9qnq5b
	- "p implies q"
	- "p only if q" ^qzfsb1
	- "a sufficient condition for q is p"
	- "q whenever p"
	- "q is necessary for p"
	- "q follows from p"
	- "q provided that p"
- Ways to remember the expressions
	- "p only if q" = "if p, then q"
		- p cannot be true when q is not true
			- "You can receive an A in the course only if your score on the final is at least 90%"
				- When p is true and q is false, condition is false because p can't be true when q is not true
				- When p is true and q is true, condition is true
				- When p is false, and q is either true or false, condition is true because our only condition is that p cannot be true when q is not true. p only if q. Any other setup doesn't matter which keeps the condition true or not false
	- "q is necessary for p " = "if p, then q"
		- p cannot be true unless q is true
			- So when p is true, q is true (condition true)
			- When p is false, q can be true or false (condition true)
			- When p is true but q is false (condition false)
	- "p is sufficient for q" = "if p, then q
		- If p is true, then q must be true
			- p is false, q can be true or false
			- p is true, p must be true or condition is false
	- "q unless $\lnot$p" = "if p, then q"
		- If $\lnot$p is false, then q must be true (so false when p is true and q is false)
		- Example: "You might have trouble understanding how "unless" is used in conditional statements unless you read this paragraph carefully"
			- Think "q unless $\lnot$p"
				- Finding propositions
					- q = You will have trouble understanding
					- $\lnot p$ = You read this paragraph carefully
						- $p$ = You did not read this paragraph carefully
				- Translation into "if p, then q"
					- p = T, q = T
						- If you did not read this paragraph correctly, then you will have trouble understanding (TRUE)
					- p = T, q = F
						- You did not read the paragraph carefully, then you will not have trouble understanding (FALSE because when $\lnot$p is false, q must be true)
					- P = F, q = T/F
						- If You read this paragraph carefully, then you will have trouble understanding / no trouble understanding (TRUE because it doesn't contradict when $\lnot p$ is false. There is no guarantee that reading carefully will make it more or less trouble understanding the conditional. It's only guaranteed that when you do not read the paragraph, you will have trouble understanding)

##### Example 10
- p = "Maria learns discrete mathematics"
- q = "Maria will find a good job"
	- "If p, then q"
		- If Maria learns discrete mathematics, then she will find a good job
	- "q when p"
		- Maria will find a good job when she learns discrete mathematics
	- "a sufficient condition for q is p"
		- For Maria to get a good job, it is sufficient for her to learn discrete mathematics
	- "q unless $\lnot$p"
		- Maria will find a good job unless she does not learn discrete mathematics
- For "If Juan has a smartphone, then 2 + 3 = 6"
	- “We would not use these last two conditional statements in natural language (except perhaps in sarcasm), because there is no relationship between the hypothesis and the conclusion in either statement.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=31&annotation=7I5A98T5))
	- “The mathematical concept of a [[conditional statement]] is independent of a cause-and effect relationship between hypothesis and conclusion.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=31&annotation=EBHHC3Z6))
	- “Our definition of a conditional statement specifies its truth values; it is not based on English usage.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=31&annotation=8CK9ZF58))
- “Most programming languages contain statements such as if p then S, where p is a proposition and S is a program segment (one or more statements to be executed).” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=31&annotation=TFEU6EVN))
	- S is not a proposition (just a set of executable instructions)
	- “When execution of a program encounters such a statement, S is executed if p is true, but S is not executed if p is false,” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 8](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=31&annotation=HAASSGAF))

##### Example 11
- What is the value of the variable x after the statement "if 2 + 2 = 4, then x := x + 1" if x = 0 before this statement is encountered?
	- “The symbol := stands for assignment.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=32&annotation=EWZJ4IRP))
	- x = 1 since 2+ 2 = 4 is true

##### Converse, Contrapositive, and  Inverse
- “The proposition q → p is called the [[converse]] of p → q. The [[contrapositive]] of p → q is the proposition ¬q → ¬p. The proposition ¬p → ¬q is called the [[inverse]] of p → q.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=32&annotation=ITUZXI28))
	- “only the contrapositive always has the same truth value as p → q.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=32&annotation=DC2RXSZP))
- “Note that when p is true and q is false, the original conditional statement is false, but the converse and the inverse are both true.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=32&annotation=GFPYZL75))
- “When two compound propositions always have the same truth values, regardless of the truth values of its propositional variables, we call them [[equivalent]].” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=32&annotation=7H6H9EEI))
	- “The converse and the inverse of a conditional statement are also equivalent,” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=32&annotation=CAN2N4RF))

##### Example 12
- The home team wins whenever it is raining
	- "q whenever p" = "p $\implies$ q"
		- Conditional
			- If it is raining, then the home team wins
		- Contrapositive

- “Only the contrapositive is equivalent to the original statement.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=32&annotation=HKP6PZUR))

##### Biconditionals
- “another way to combine propositions that expresses that two propositions have the same truth value.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=33&annotation=BPA2CRWD))

##### Definition 6
- “Let p and q be propositions. The biconditional statement p ↔ q is the proposition “p if and only if q.” The biconditional statement p ↔ q is true when p and q have the same truth values, and is false otherwise. Biconditional statements are also called bi-implications.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=33&annotation=YJ6C7N3D))

	- Truth Table
- ““if and only if” to express this logical connective” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=33&annotation=5II928I4))
- Alternatives to writing $p \iff q$
	- "p is necessary and sufficient for q"
	- "if p then q, and conversely"
	- "p iff q." 
	- "p exactly when q"
- Same truth value as “(p → q) ∧ (q → p).” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=33&annotation=4M8DH62W))

##### Example 13
- “You can take the flight if and only if you buy a ticket.”” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=33&annotation=R4F248E5))

##### Implicit use of Biconditionals
- “Instead, biconditionals are often expressed using an “if, then” or an “only if” construction. The other part of the “if and only if” is implicit. That is, the converse is implied, but not stated.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=33&annotation=2QNGBJP4))
- ““If you finish your meal, then you can have dessert.” What is really meant is “You can have dessert if and only if you finish your meal.”” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=33&annotation=KX5G6H4F))
- “Because precision is essential in mathematics and in logic, we will always distinguish between the conditional statement p → q and the biconditional statement p ↔ q.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=33&annotation=GBRXQL2E))

#### (1.1.4) Truth Tables of Compound Propositions
- “We have now introduced five important logical connectives—[[conjunction]], [[disjunction]], [[exclusive or]], [[Implication]], and the [[biconditional operator]]—as well as [[negation]].” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=34&annotation=7YP2GLPR))
- “The truth values of the compound proposition for each combination of truth values of the propositional variables in it is found in the final column of the table.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=34&annotation=7JY5SN6V))

##### Example 14
- Construct truth table of compound proposition
	- $(p \lor \lnot q) \implies (p \land q)$
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 12.06.25 AM.png]]
	- Truth table shown

#### (1.1.5) Precedence of Logical Operators
- “We can construct compound propositions using the negation operator and the logical operators defined so far.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=34&annotation=NJDCKRW5))
- “We will generally use parentheses to specify the order in which logical operators in a compound proposition are to be applied.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=34&annotation=2HI3T8I7))
- “It is generally the case that unary operators that involve only one object precede binary operators.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=34&annotation=7QRCF4PR))
- “Another general rule of precedence is that the conjunction operator takes precedence over the disjunction operator,” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=34&annotation=P9PQ6RX3))
	- p $\lor$ q $\land$ r means $p \lor (q \land r)$
- “Finally, it is an accepted rule that the conditional and biconditional operators, → and ↔, have lower precedence than the conjunction and disjunction operators, ∧ and ∨.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=34&annotation=NQXRCKJD))
- “the conditional operator has precedence over the biconditional operator.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=34&annotation=BWQRMNQ2))

	- Precedence levels of [[logical operators]]

#### (1.1.6) Logic and Bit Operations
- “Computers represent information using bits. A [[bit]] is a symbol with two possible values, namely, 0 (zero) and 1 (one).” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=35&annotation=KU6E6WRI))
- “bit comes from binary digit, because zeros and ones are the digits used in binary representations of numbers.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=35&annotation=ZC9ERFBC))

- “bit can be used to represent a truth value, because there are two truth values, namely, true and false.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=35&annotation=KVDLYR99))
- “1bit to represent true and a 0 bit to represent false.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=35&annotation=8RVAJXR2))
- “[[variable]] is called a [[Boolean variable]] if its value is either true or false. Consequently, a Boolean variable can be represented using a bit.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=35&annotation=PVS3QKW2))
- “Computer [[bit operations]] correspond to the logical connectives.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=35&annotation=GVZPH57C))

	- Truth value for bits
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-10 at 12.22.32 AM.png]]
	- “We will also use the notation OR, AND, and XOR for the operators ∨, ∧, and ⊕, as is done in various programming languages.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=35&annotation=AKXJ3Y82))
- “Information is often represented using [[bit string|bit strings]], which are lists of zeros and ones. When this is done, operations on the bit strings can be used to manipulate this information.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=35&annotation=MAJD5IH6))

##### Definition 7
- “A [[bit string]] is a sequence of zero or more bits. The length of this string is the number of bits in the string.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=35&annotation=TTRDSY4S))

##### Example 15
- “101010011 is a bit string of length nine.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=35&annotation=C9PM6PZJ))

- “Software systems based on the rules of logic have been developed for constructing some, but not all, types of proofs automatically.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=40&annotation=56YKQ39N))

#### (1.2.2) Translating English Sentences
- “There are many reasons to translate English sentences into expressions involving propositional variables and logical connectives.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=40&annotation=48FGUMFX))
	- English often ambiguous
- Translating sentences to compound statements removes ambiguity
	- “we can use [[rules of inference]] (which are discussed in Section 1.6) to reason about them.” ([Rosen, 2019, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/7U457C8R)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/SSBAAPX5?page=40&annotation=J9E437SX))

##### Example 1
- Translating English sentence to logical expression
	- "You can access the Internet from campus only if you are a computer science major or you are not a freshman"
		- a: You can access the Internet from campus
		- c: You are a computer science major
		- f: You are a freshman
	- $a \to (c \lor \lnot f)$
		- "p only if q" [^2]
##### Example 2
- You cannot ride the roller coaster if you are under 4 feet tall unless you are older than 16 years old 
	- p: you can ride the roller coaster
	- q: You are under 4 feet tall
	- r: You are older than 16 years old
	- t
		- "q unless $\lnot$p" [^3]
