- Foundation of discrete math course is the idea of a set
- A SET is a collection of objects

	- This is a set with a collection of 3 objects
- What about a set of NO objects?

		- This is a set of no objects
		- Notation: {} or $\varnothing$ 
- What is {$\varnothing$}

		- The above looks like this
		- The element that it has is itself a set. The empty set.
- Is $\varnothing$ $\subset$ {1, 2, 3}?

		- Recall: A $\subset$ B means: If x $\in$ A, then x $\in$ B
		- This is vacuously true!
			- Everything in the empty set is inside the set {1,2,3}. It is vacuously true because there is nothing for us to check to verify that this does occur. It is just true in this trivial or vacuous way.
