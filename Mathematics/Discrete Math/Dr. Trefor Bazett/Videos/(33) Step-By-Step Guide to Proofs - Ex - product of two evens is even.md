	- Theorem: an even integer times an even integer is another even integer
	- Step 1: Define Terms
		- Informal Definition: n is an even integer if n can be written as twice an integer
		- Formal Definition: For n an integer:
	- Step 2: State Theorem Formally
	- Format: $\forall x \in D, P(x) \implies Q(x)$
	- Step 3: Intuitive idea
