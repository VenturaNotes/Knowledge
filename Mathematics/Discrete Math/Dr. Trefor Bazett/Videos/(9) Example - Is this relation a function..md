- Example: Consider the relation C where (x, y) $\in$ C if $x^2 + y^2 = 1$. Is this a function?
	- This is the equation of a circle
	- Represents the set of points along the circle of radius 1 centered at the origin

		- Make the qualification from `[-1,1]` to `[-1,1]`
			- (1) For every single input, there will be an output.
				- It is a function from the intervals and not a function for the entire real numbers
			- (2) (0, 1) $\in$ C and (0, -1) $\in$ C
				- It is not a function because it fails the vertical line test
				- It is a relation and not a function because it has more than 1 output with a single input

		- If we took the condition of only positive values, then it would pass the vertical line test and would be a function. Sometimes what you're given is not a function but if you can make some restrictions, then we recover that it is indeed a function.
