	- [[Generalization]] is an argument of the form: (just need one of two things)
		- p
		- Therefore, p $\lor$ q
	- Example
		- I'm a Canadian
		- Therefore, I'm a Canadian or I'm a unicorn
	- [[Specialization]] is an argument of the form
		- p $\land$ q
		- Therefore, p.
	- Example
		- I'm a Canadian and I have a PhD
		- Therefore, I'm a Canadian
	- [[Contradiction]] is an argument of the form:
		- Example ^bc0652
			- $\lnot p \implies q$
			- Therefore, p.
		- If assuming statement was false which leads to nonsensical contradiction, then initial statement must be true
