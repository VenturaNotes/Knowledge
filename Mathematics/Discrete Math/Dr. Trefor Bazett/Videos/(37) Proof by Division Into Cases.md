	- Theorem: The square of an integer has the same [[parity]] (this theorem is true)
		- Parity means even or odd
	- Case 1: Assume n is [[even]]
		- $\exists k_1 \in \mathbb{Z}, n = 2k_1$
			- There exists a $k_1$ in the set of integers where n is even
	- Case 2: Assume n is [[odd]]

	- [[Division into cases]]
		- To prove P(x) $\lor$ Q(x) $\implies$ R(x)
	- Since we have demonstrated for all of the different ways that the hypothesis could possible be true, we therefore have demonstrated for the entire disjunction implying the conclusion
