## Functions
- Ex: f(x) = $x^2$ 
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-31 at 11.53.11 AM.png]]
		- For every input value x spits out a value y
		- To be a function, you have to pass the vertical line test.
			- If there is 1 input, there needs to be at most 1 output
		- The domain is the input values which is all the real numbers

## Functions Intuitively
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-31 at 11.55.07 AM.png]]
	- $x^2$ machine (squaring machine)
		- Input come from my domain (set of possible inputs)
			- domain will be input values of a set of possible inputs
		- Output is in range
			- Set of possible outputs
	- Properties
		- Do something to every input in my domain. If the set is numbers, it will do something to every number
		- One output for each input
