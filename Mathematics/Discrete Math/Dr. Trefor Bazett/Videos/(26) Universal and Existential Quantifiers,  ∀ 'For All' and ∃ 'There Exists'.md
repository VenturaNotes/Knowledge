	- The [[Universal Quantifier]] $\forall$ means "for all" ^656027
		- The "for all" quantifies some properties about the [[predicate]] 
		- Main Use: "quantifying" predicates:
			- $\forall$x $\in$ D, P(x)
			- For all x in the domain, P(x) is true
		- Ex: Every dog is a mammal
			- "Every" is synonymous "for all"
		- D = dogs; P(x): x is a mammal!
			- D is the set of dogs
	- The [[Existential Quantifier]] $\exists$ means "there exists"
		- Main Use: "quantifying" predicates:
			- $\exists x \in D, P(x)$
			- There exists x in the domain, such that P(x) is true.
		- Example: Some person is the oldest in the world
		- There exists a person in the world that has this particular predicate being true (x is the old person in the world)

	- Important to keep in mind the difference between logical statements and predicates which depend on the input variable x that lives in some domain.
	- Statement
		- P: "Roofus is a mammal"
	- Predicate
		- P(x): "x is a mammal"
	- Statement
		- Q: $\forall x \in D, P(x):\text{"every dog is a mammal"}$
			- This is a true statement
			- Every dog is a mammal is a true statement
	- When quantifying a predicate, it turns it into a logical statement
