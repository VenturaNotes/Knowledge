	- Theorem: an even integer plus an odd integer is another odd integer
	- Will be shown the basic scaffolds on creating a formal and direct proof
	- Before you even get started proving a theorem, you have to have a precise definition of the concepts in that particular theorem
	- QED box is used at end of proof 
	- Proof
		- Assumption & Conclusion Make up the theorem
		- Definitions
		- Manipulations 
	- Direct proofs of $\forall x \in D, P(x) \implies Q(x)$
		- (1) State the Assumptions
		- (2) Formally Define the Assumptions
		- (3) Manipulate
		- (4) Arrive at Definition of Conclusion
		- (5) State the Conclusion
