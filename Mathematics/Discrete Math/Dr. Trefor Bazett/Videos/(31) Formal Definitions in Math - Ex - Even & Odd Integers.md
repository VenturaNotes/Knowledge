	- Goal: Precisely define even & odd integers
	- Even Integers
		- Informal Definition: n is an even integer if n can be written as twice an integer.
		- Form definition: n is an even integer if $\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n = 2k$
	- Odd Integers
		- Informal definition: n is an odd integer if n is an integer that is not even
		- Formal Definition: n is an odd integer if $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n = 2k + 1$
