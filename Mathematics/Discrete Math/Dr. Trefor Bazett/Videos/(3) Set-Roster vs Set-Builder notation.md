## Set-Roster Notation
- {0, 2, 4, 6,...}
	- Ellipses indicates the pattern continues
- We can have a very large number of elements in our set
- {..., -6, -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, 6, ...}
	- Pattern can be clearly established both ways
	- The pattern which is evident can continue

## Set-Builder Notation
- General Form: {x | P(x)}
	- x is a variable
	- | means "such that"
	- x is a property that we want to be true
- Above is read as "the set of the variables "x" such that the "x" has some particular property"
	- Example: Even Integers
		- {x | x = twice an integer}
		- 6 is an element of the set because it's twice the integer of 3
	- Example: Numbers whose square root is an integer
		- $\{x | \sqrt x \in \mathbb{Z}\}$
			- The set of numbers such that the square root is an integer
			- Translates the above set
