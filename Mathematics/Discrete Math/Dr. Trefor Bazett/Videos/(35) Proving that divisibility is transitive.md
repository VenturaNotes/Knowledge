	- [[Divisibility]]
	- Definition (of divisibility): For n and d integers, d $\ne$ 0, $d\mid n$ $\iff$ if $\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n = dk$
		- $d | n$ this claim is saying that n is divisible by d
			- d is the divisor multiplied by "k" the new integer
		- $d |n$
			- d divides n
			- n is divisible by d
			- n is a multiple of d
			- d is a factor of n
	- Sometimes referred to as transitivity of divisibility
