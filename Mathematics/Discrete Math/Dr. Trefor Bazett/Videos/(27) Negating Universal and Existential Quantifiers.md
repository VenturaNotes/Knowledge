	- Negate "$\forall x \in \mathbb{Z}^+, x > 3$"
		- For all x in the positive integers, x will be greater than 3
	- If it is not the case that everything is true, there must be something where it's false
	- Negating a universal
		- Starts with "for all x's in the domain, some property is true"
		- There is at least one value where the property is false when negating a universal
		- Turns the universal into an existential and negate the predicate
	- Negate "Someone in our class is taller than 7 feet"
	- $\exists x \in D, P(x)$
		- Existential quantifier on a predicate
	- "Everyone in our class is shorter than 7 feet"
	- Negating an existential
		- Turns the existential to a universal and negates the predicate
