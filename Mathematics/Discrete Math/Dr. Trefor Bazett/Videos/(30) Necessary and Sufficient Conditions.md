	- Quadrilaterals are just shapes with 4 sides
	- All squares are rectangles
		- If x is a Square, then x is a Rectangle
			- If A(x), then B(x)
				- If given the first thing, it must be the case that we get the second. If we wanted to conclude the second, it is sufficient for me to conclude the first
		- A(x) is a [[sufficient]] condition for B(x)
			- If I have the first one, I automatically get the second
				- i.e. "x being a square is sufficient to conclude x is a rectangle"
					- However, I don't need it to be a square to be a rectangle. It could be something else but still might be a rectangle. That's why it's a sufficient property

	- If x is a Rectangle, then x is a Quadrilateral
		- If B(x), then C(x)
	- Contrapositive
		- If x is not a Quadrilateral, then x is not a Rectangle
			- If $\lnot C(x)$, then $\lnot B(x)$
				- C(x) is a necessary condition for B(x)
					- i.e. "x being a quadrilateral is necessary to conclude x is a rectangle"
	- Sufficient to have a square if we want a rectangle
	- But necessary to have a quadrilateral if we want a rectangle
	- If we're interested in concluding the middle thing, the former one is going to be the sufficient condition and the latter one is going to be the necessary one.
	- A(x) $\implies$ B(x)
		- A(x) is a sufficient condition for B(x)
			- This is when the goal is to deduce the B(x)
			- If we want to get the B(x), it is sufficient for me to have the A(x)
				- Being a square is a sufficient condition for being a rectangle
		- B(x) is a necessary condition for A(x)
			- Goal is to deduce the A(x)
			- If we want to get the A(x), we need the B(x) as necessary 
				- Being a rectangle is a necessary condition for being a square
