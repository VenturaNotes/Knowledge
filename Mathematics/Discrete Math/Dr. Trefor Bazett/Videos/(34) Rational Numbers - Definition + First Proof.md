	- Goal: Prove Theorems about Rationals
	- Informal Definition: n is a rational number if i is a fraction. Ex: $3/7$
	- Formal Definition: n is a rational number if $\exists p \in \mathbb{Z}, \exists q \in \mathbb{Z}\backslash \{0\}$ such that $n = \frac pq$
		- $\mathbb{Z}\backslash \{0\}$
			- The nonzero integers
			- All of the integers minus the set that only contains 0 (the slash means minus)
	- Theorem: The sum of two rational numbers is another rational number
	- Five step process for direct proofs
		- Assumption
		- Definition of assumption
		- Manipulation
		- definition of conclusion
		- Conclusion
