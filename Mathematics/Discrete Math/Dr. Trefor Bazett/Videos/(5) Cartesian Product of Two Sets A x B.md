## Ordered Pairs (a, b)
- Order Matters
- (a, b) = (c, d) if a=c & b=d
	- First two components must be equal to the second two components
	- It is important to tell us what makes the mathematical object equal
- a & b could come from different sets
	- (3, apple)
- Definition: The [[Cartesian Product]] A $\times$ B is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) where a $\in$ A and b $\in$ B
	- Example: Cartesian Plane

		- In the ordered pair (2, 1), the first component tells me the X coordinate and the second component tells me the height. 
			- (2, 1) $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$ x $\mathbb{R}$ 
				- The first $\mathbb{R}$ is the real numbers for the X component and the second $\mathbb{R}$ is the real numbers for the y component. 
				- It is read as $\mathbb{R}$ crossed $\mathbb{R}$
					- It represents the entire cartesian plane. It tells us every possible pairing where we're told the x and y coordinates
	- Example {a, b} $\times$ {0,1}
		- A = {a, b}
		- B = {0, 1}
		- A $\times$ B = {(a,1), (a,0), (b,1), (b,0)}
			- We have list of 4 different elements
			- That forms the cross product
			- Every element is an ordered pair
			- The above would be your cartesian product
