## Relations
- Example: a < b
	- Compares two integers
	- Some pairs have this relationship
		- 2 < 5
	- Some pairs don't
		- 5 $\nless$  2
			- It is not the case that 5 is less then 2
- Example 2
	- We often visually depict a set as a circle and then write elements in circle

		- Set that contains a bunch of humans
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-31 at 11.43.54 AM.png|100]]
		- This is the set of pets
	- The human that owns the pet is a relationship
		- First human owns the first dog
		- Second human owns the cat
		- Third human owns the first dog

		- It tells you which ordered pairs is going to have relationships
		- ($h_1$, $d_1$ ) means human $h_1$ owns $d_1$ 
- Definition: A Relation R between A and B is a subset of A $\times$ B
	- ie ordered pairs
		- (a, b) $\in$ A $\times$ B
			- The capital letters are donating the sets that the lowercase letters are coming from.
		- Example
			- {2,5} $\in$ A $\times$ B
				- 2 is l s than 5 so this is true
			- {5, 2} $\notin$ A $\times$ B 
				- 5 is not less than 2 so this is not true for the real numbers of A and B that represent the set A to contain numbers less than the elements in B. 
				- There is some collection of ordered pairs in $A \times B$ (the cartesian product), but is not going to be necessarily the entirety so its a subset
