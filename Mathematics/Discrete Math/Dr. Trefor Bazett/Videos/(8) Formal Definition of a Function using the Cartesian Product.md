- Definition: A function F between A and B is a relation between A and B such that:
	- A relation is a subset of $A \times B$ 
	- Properties
		- (1) For every element x $\in$ A, there is an element y $\in$ B such that (x, y) $\in$  F
			- For every input, there is going to be some output that my function is giving
			- For every input x, there is some output y, F(x) = y
		- (2) If (x, y) $\in$ F and (x, z) $\in$ F then y = z
			- This is the analog of the vertical line test
