- A [[set]] is a collection of objects
	- Examples
		- A = Students in this class
		- B = {1, 3, 4, 7}
			- 3 $\in$ B
		- $\mathbb{Z}$ = Integers
			- 3 $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$ 
			- $\pi$ $\notin$ $\mathbb{Z}$
	- Elements of Sets
		- John $\in$ 
			- John is an element of the set A (students taking the class)
- Order and repetition Don't matter
	- {1, 3, 4, 7} = {4, 7, 3, 1} = {4, 4 , 4, 7, 7, 3, 1}
- Subsets
	- Every element of A is also in B
		- A is a subset of B if it's the case that everyone of the elements of A is also going to be in B. B is the larger set, A is the smaller set
	- A $\subseteq$ B means "A is a subset of B"
		- Example
			- {1,3} $\subseteq$ {1, 3, 4, 7}
				- First set is A and second set is B
			- A = {1, 8} $\not \subseteq$ B
			- Even integers $\subseteq$ $\mathbb{Z}$
