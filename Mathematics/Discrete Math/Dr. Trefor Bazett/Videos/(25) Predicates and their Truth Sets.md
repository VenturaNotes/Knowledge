	- Errata
		- I believe the $\subseteq$ symbol is wrong since TS does not contain every element of $\mathbb{Z}^+$
	- Recall: A statement is either TRUE or FALSE
		- "x>5" is not going to be a logical statement
	- A [[predicate]] is a sentence depending on variables which becomes a statement upon substituting values in the domain
	- Example
		- P(x): x is a factor of 12 with domain $\mathbb{Z}^+$
			- Every predicate needs to be paired with a specific domain
				- Domain is where the x's live (the allowable inputs)
	- The [[Truth Set]] of a predicate P(x):
		- {x $\in$ D | P(x)}
			- [[Set-builder notation]]
			- The set of all values of x in the domain such that the predicate is true
				- all things in the domain such that some property is true
			- i.e All values x in the domain where P(x) is true
		- Example
			- P(x): x is a factor of 12 with domain $\mathbb{Z}^+$
			- TS = {1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12}
				- Truth set
				- $\subseteq$ $\mathbb{Z}^+$ 
					- Subset of the positive integers?
						- Should be $\subset$? (proper subset)
