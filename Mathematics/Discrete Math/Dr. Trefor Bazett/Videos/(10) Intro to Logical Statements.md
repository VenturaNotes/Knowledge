- A statement is a sentence that is either True or False
	- Examples
		- p: "5 > 2"
			- True
		- q: "2 > 5"
			- False
		- r: "x > 2"
			- Not a statement
	- Helps give a shorthand by saying "p" is the statement 5 > 2.

## New statements from old
- $\lnot$ p
	- Not p
- $p \land q$ 
	- p and q
- $p \lor q$ 
	- p or q

## Examples
- "My shirt is gray but my shorts are not"
	- p: "my shirt is gray"
	- q: "my shorts are gray"
- "But" as well as "And" are the same logically
- $p \land \lnot q$ 
	- This is the logical form that the sentence has
