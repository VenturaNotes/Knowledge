- What is logic?
	- Logic is the science of reasoning. It helps us to understand and reason about different mathematical statements.
	- With the rules of logic, we would be able to think about mathematical statements and finally we would be able to prove or disprove those mathematical statements precisely.
	- Example 1
		- Rules of logic enable us to reason about the mathematical statements like: "For every positive integer n, the sum of positive integers not exceeding n is n(n+1)/2". <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Either it is a valid mathematical argument or it is an invalid argument.</mark>
	- Purpose of logic is to construct valid arguments (or proofs). Once we prove a mathematical statement is true, then we call it a Theorem and this is the basis of whole mathematics.
		- Example 2:
			- Famous Knights and Knaves Puzzle
				- "In an Island there are two kinds of inhabitants, Knights, who always tell the truth, and their opposites, Knaves, who always lie. You encounter two people Alice and Bob. Who are Alice and Bob if Alice says "Bob is a Knight" and Bob says "The two of us are opposite types?"
					- These types of problems can be very easily solved using an area of logic called [[propositional logic]]

## Propositional Logic:
- What is proposition?
	- Proposition is a declarative sentence (a sentence that is declaring a fact or stating an argument) which can be either TRUE or FALSE but cannot be both.
		- For example:
			- (1) Delhi is the capital of India
			- (2) Water Froze this morning
			- (3) 1 + 1 = 2
		- Sentences which are not propositions
			- (1) What time is it?
			- (2) x + 1 = 2 (can be both TRUE or FALSE)
			- (3) Send us your resume before 11 PM
			- (4) I request you to please allow me a day off
			- (5) Fetch my umbrella!
