- Target Audience
	- Students who are preparing for GATE and other competitive exams
	- Students who want to learn competitive programming
	- College going students who have Discrete Mathematics in their syllabus
	- Everyone who wants to learn Discrete Mathematics as a whole or may be a small subset of this subject
- Why Study Discrete Mathematics?
	- (1) It develops your mathematical thinking
	- (2) Improves your problem solving ability.
	- (3) If you are computer science student, then no need to go anywhere else because Discrete Mathematics is for you. Discrete Mathematics is important to survive in subjects like: compiler design, databases, computer security, operating system, automata theory etc.
	- (4) Many problems can be solve using Discrete Mathematics
		- For example:
			- Sorting the list of integers
			- Finding the shortest path from your home to your friend's home.
			- Drawing a graph with two conditions:
				- (1) You are not allowed to lift your pen
				- (2) You are not allowed to repeat edges

			- How many different combinations of passwords are possible with just 8 alphanumeric characters
			- Encrypt a message and deliver it to your friend and you don't want anybody to read that message except your friend.


## What is Discrete Mathematics?
- Discrete mathematics is the study of discrete objects
	- Discrete means: "distinct or not connected".
- It is not a branch of Mathematics. It is rather a description of set of branches that have one common property - that they are "discrete" and not "continuous".
- Discrete vs continuous
- The whole world of mathematics is divided in two realms: 
	- (1) Discrete
		- (1) Natural Numbers are discrete
			- For Example: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

				- Observe the gaps
				- y = x, x $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$, y $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$ 
		- (2) Digital clock is "discrete" in nature.
			- There is no continuous time,
			- Transition from one time to another is sharp

	- (2) Continuous Objects:
		- (1) Real numbers are continuous
			- For example: between 0 and 1 - 0, 0.001..., 0.000001..., 0.10001..., and so on
				- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-02 at 5.58.00 PM.png]]
					- Continuous line, no gaps
					- $y=x, x \in \mathbb{R}, y \in \mathbb{R}$ 
		- (2) Analog clock is continuous in nature. In Analog clock - hour, minute and second hands move smoothly over time.
			- Consider the clock where minute hand, hour hand and second hand sweeps around the time smoothly
