- Sometimes, we want a collection of ordered pairs. 
- Let's say we are interested in finding all possible combinations of X and Y coordinates where X and Y values should not exceed 3.
	- Interested in pairs
- {(1,1), (1,2), (1,3), (2,1), (2,2), (2,3), (3,1), (3,2), (3,3)}
	- This is what the collection looks like
- Here, (a, b) for any a and b is called an ordered pair.
- Note: 
	- (a, b) and (b, a) are not equal

			- This is an example for why order matters
	- Therefore, in an ordered pair, order does matter.
- Definition of Cartesian Product:
	- Let A and B are two sets. The cartesian product of A and B, denoted by AXB, is the set of all ordered pairs (a, b), where a $\in$ A and b $\in$ B. $$A \times B = \{(a,b)| \in A \text{ \& } b \in B\}$$
- Example 1: What is the cartesian product of A = {1,2} and B = {a, b , c}?
	- Solution: $A \times B$
