- There are 6 logical operators that we will focus on:
	- Our focus in this lecture
		- Negation
		- Conjunction
		- Disjunction
	- Exclusive OR
	- Implication
	- Biconditional

## Negation
- Let p be a proposition. $\lnot$ p is called negation of p which simply states that "It is not the case that p" if p is true then $\lnot$ p is false. if p is false then $\lnot$ p is true.

## Conjunction
- Let p and q be two propositions. Conjunction of p and q is denoted by p $\land$ q. When both p and q are true then only the compound proposition p $\land$ q is true.
- "but" as well as "and" are the same in propositional logic

## Disjunction
- Let p and q be propositions. Disjunction of p and q is denoted by p $\lor$ q. When both p and q are false then only the compound proposition p $\lor$ q is false.
