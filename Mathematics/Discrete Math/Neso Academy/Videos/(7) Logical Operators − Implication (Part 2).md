## Representations
- Different ways to represent conditional statements
	- All of them should be represented as p $\rightarrow$ q
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-03 at 11.09.16 AM.png]]
		- "if p then q"
		- "p implies q"
		- "q when p"
		- "q whenever p"
		- "q follows from p"
		- Important / Difficult
			- "p only if q"
			- "q is necessary for p"
			- "p is sufficient for q"
			- "q unless $\lnot$ p"
- "p only if q"
	- How "if p then q" and "p only if q" can be the same?
	- Example
		- "I will stay at home only if I'm sick"
			- Above statement is of the form "p only if q"
			- According to the above statement, becoming sick is the necessary condition that will make you stay at home.
			- This means "if you're not sick then, you cannot stay at home at any cost."
			- In order to falsify the above statement, q must be FALSE and p must be TRUE i.e. you are not sick and you still stay at home.
		- Proof idea: truth value of p and q must be same in order to falsify the statement.
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-03 at 10.44.24 AM.png]]
		- This is proved because in both cases, p must be TRUE and q must be FALSE for both statements to be falsified.
		- Why "p only if q" is not equivalent to "if q then p"?

			- "I'm sick" is the necessary condition
