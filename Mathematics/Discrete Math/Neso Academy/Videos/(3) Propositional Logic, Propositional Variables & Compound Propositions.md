- Propositional Logic
	- Area of logic that studies ways of joining and/or modifying propositions to form more complicated propositions and it also studies the logical relationships and properties derived from these combined/altered propositions.
		- What does this definition really mean?
			- Statement 1 - "Adam is good in playing football"
			- Statement 2 - "Adam is good in playing football and this time he is representing his college at National level."

				- Proposition 2
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-02 at 6.33.25 PM.png]]
				- Modifying the statement using negation
			- Fact: propositional logic is sometimes called as "sentential logic" or "statement logic"

## Why do we need compound propositions?
- because most of the mathematical statements are constructed by combining one or more than one propositions. As simple as that!
- Propositional variables:
	- Which one of the following is convenient to express:
		- "Adam is good in playing football and this time he is representing his college at National level"
		- OR
		- if p = Adam is good in playing football
			- q = this time he is representing his college at National level.
			- $p \land q$ 
				- This is called and operator in propositional logic
				- p and q
		- Definition: variables that are used to represent propositions are called propositional variables
