- Definition
	- Let p and q be propositions. The proposition "if p then q" denoted by p $\rightarrow$ q is called implication or conditional statement.

		- Truth table
	- p is called [[hypothesis]] (or premise) and q is called [[conclusion]] (or consequence)

## Examples
- Example 1

		- Because you can make the compound proposition false only when you satisfy the first condition itself i.e. p. If that itself not satisfied then we cannot make compound proposition False. Not False means True.
- Example 2 and Example 3

	- You can't argue that the compound statement is false because your premise is false which will say nothing about the conclusion. Since we can't say that it's false, it will be assumed true. We won't be able to argue for it.
	- The compound proposition remains true for example 3 if p is false because you cannot falsify it. Not being able to falsify it means that it remains true. 
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If you cannot prove something is false, then we consider it is true</mark>
- Remember this golden point: If p is false then it doesn't matter what will be the truth value of q, $p \rightarrow q$ is always TRUE.
