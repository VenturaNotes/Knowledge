	- Dropdown box
	- The set we're picking from is either yes or no (unique and distinct items)
		- Show toolbar
		- Lock Toolbar
	- Font Size (Perhaps 5 distinct elements from small to large)
	- Default Zoom (set of integers perhaps less than 800)
	- Each item is referred to as an element or a member
		- The set which is defined by the backpack in the example is said to contain its elements
			- Elements are distinct and separate
			- Membership is binary (member of set or not member of set)
			- No set order
	- A set can be a member of a set
		- Can mix sets and items in set
			- Curly brackets define or encapsulates items inside set
	- Use capital letters to define sets
		- When referring to generic element, use lowercase letter 
	- $\in$ is a member or is an element of
	- $\notin$ is not a member or an element of
	- Elements in a set must be distinct
		- S = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3} = {1, 2, 3}
			- |S| = 3

	- Sets
		- $\mathbb{N}$ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
			- Set of [[natural numbers]]
		- $\mathbb{Z}$
			- Set of integers
		- $\mathbb{Z}^+$
			- Positive integers
		- B = {0, 1}
			- Binary set
		- $\varnothing$ = {}
			- empty set
			- Uses Greek letter "phi"
		- S = {{}}
			- Set can contain the empty set
	- [[Set-builder notation]]
		- X = { x | x satisfies one or more requirements}
			- All x such that x satisfies one or more requirements
		- S = {x | x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}^+$ $\text{and}$ x < 100}
			- Some people use colon (:) instead of a vertical pipe (|)
			- $x \in \mathbb{Z}^+$
				- The universe from which the requirements are being applied
	- Q = {p/q | p $\in$ z, q $\in$ z, and q $\notin$ 0}
		- [[Rational numbers]]. A ratio of an integer to an integer as long as the integer on the bottom is not equal to 0.
	- $\mathbb{R}$ = {x | x is a real number}

	- [[Cardinality]]
		- Number of distinct members of S
		- |S|
	- [[Finite set]] vs [[infinite set]]
		- A finite set is a cardinality not equal to infinity
		- Natural numbers, positive integers, negative integers, whole set of integers, real, irrational numbers, rational numbers, those are all infinite sets [^1]
	- A and B are equal if
		- A = B if $\forall$ x$(x \in A \iff x \in B)$
	- [[Subset]]
		- Everything in one set is contained inside of another set
			- A is a subset of B if every element in A is also an element of B.
			- A $\subseteq B$
				- A is a subset of B or is equal to B
				- A $\nsubseteq$ B (for not)
			- A $\subset$ B
				- A is a subset of B but not equal to B
				- A $\not\subset$ B (for not)
