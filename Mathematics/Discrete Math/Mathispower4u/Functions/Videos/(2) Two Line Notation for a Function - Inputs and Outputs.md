	- Interpreting a two-line function
		- Consider the function f: {1, 2, 3, 4} $\to$ {1, 2, 3, 4} given by f(n)
			- (1) Find f(3)
				- 4
					- We can say here that 4 is the image of the element of 3 from the domain
			- (2) Find an element $n$ in the domain such that f(n) = 3
				- 1
			- (3) Find an element $n$ in the domain such that $f(n) = n$
				- 2
					- Image equals input here
			- (4) Find an element of the codomain that is not in the range
				- 1
		- Notes
			- To specify the rule for a function with small domain, use [[two-line notation]] by writing a matrix with each output directly below its corresponding input
