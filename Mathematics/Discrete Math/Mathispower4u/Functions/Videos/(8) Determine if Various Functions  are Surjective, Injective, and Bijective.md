	- The following functions all have {1, 2, 3, 4} as both their domain and codomain. For each, determine whether it is only injective, only surjective, bijective, or neither injective nor surjective
	- Notes
		- A function is injective provided every element of the codomain is the image of at most element from the domain (one-to-one)
			- Injective functions do not have repeated elements from the codomain in the range, but may miss elements
		- A function is surjective provided every element of the codomain is the image of at least one element from the domain. (onto)
			- Surjective functions do not miss elements from the codomain in the range, but may have repeats
		- A function is bijective if it is injective and surjective
