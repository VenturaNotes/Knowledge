		- A function is a rule that assigns each element from an input set to exactly one element of the output set. A function f maps X to Y is usually written as F: $X \to Y$.
			- The set of all inputs for a function is called the [[Domain (Math)|domain]]
			- The set of all allowable outputs is called the [[codomain]]
			- The set of all actual outputs is the [[range]]
			- The output is called the [[image]] of the input
		- Eamples:
			- $f: \mathbb{Z} \to \mathbb{Z}$ defined by $f(n) = 3N$. The domain and codomain are both the set of integers. However, the range is noly the set of inte
