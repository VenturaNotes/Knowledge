	- Propositional Logic: Deduction Rule
		- Decide whether this is a valid deduction rule
		- Make a truth table which contains all the lines of the argument form. 
		- Find the rows in which all of the premises are true. Then see if the conclusion is also true.
		- Look at the second to last row. Here all three premises of the argument are true, but the conclusion is false.
		- This is not a valid deduction rule. 
	- Propositional Logic: Deduction Rule
		- While we have the truth table in front of us, look at rows 1, 3, and 5. These are the only rows in which all of the statements $P \to R, Q \to R, \text{ and } P \lor Q$ are true. It also happens that $R$ is true in these rows as well. Thus, we have discovered a new deduction rule we know is valid:
			- A valid deduction rule.
