	- Propositional Logic: Deduction Rule
		- Show that this is a valid deduction rule
			- Parts: Conclusion, Premise, Premise
		- Make a truth table which contains all the lines of the argument form
		- Find the rows in which all of the premises are true. Then see if the conclusion is true.
		- Both $P \to Q$ and $\lnot P \to Q$ are true in rows 1 and 3. In those rows $Q$ is also true.
		- It is a valid deduction rule
		- Sometimes you'll see the truth table with some extra columns. The last 3 columns in the second table are in the same order of the argument. This is nice because it makes the table easier to read.
