	- Propositional Logic: Logically Equivalent Statements and De Morgan's Laws
		- Notice that the final column in the truth table for $\lnot P \lor Q$ is identical to the final column in the truth table for $P \to Q$
		- This says that no matter what P and Q are, the statements $\lnot P \lor Q$ and $P \to Q$ either are both true or both false. We therefore say these statements are [[logically equivalent]]
		- Two [[molecular statement|(molecular) statements]] P and Q are logically equivalent provided P is true precisely when Q is true. That is, P and Q have the same truth value under any assignment of truth values to their atomic parts. To verify that two statements are logically equivalent, you can make a truth table for each and check whether the columns for the two statements are identical
		- Recognizing two statements is logically equivalent can be very helpful. Rephrasing a mathematical statement can often lend insight into what it is saying, or how to prove or refute it. By using truth tables, we can systematically verify that two statements are indeed logically equivalent
