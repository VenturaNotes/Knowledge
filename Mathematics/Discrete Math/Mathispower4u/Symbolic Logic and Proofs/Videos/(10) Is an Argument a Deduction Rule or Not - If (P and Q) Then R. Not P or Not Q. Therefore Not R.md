	- Deduction Rule Using a Truth Table
		- Determine if the following is a valid deduction rule:
		- Looking at rows 3, 5, or 7, in each of these (one would be enough) both premises are true. However, the conclusion ($\lnot R$) is false. Thus, this is NOT a valid deduction rule.
		- Note: $(P \land Q) \to R$ and $\lnot P \lor \lnot Q$ are also not logically equivalent (columns are not identical)
		- For two statements to be logically equivalent, the columns in the truth table would have to be identical
