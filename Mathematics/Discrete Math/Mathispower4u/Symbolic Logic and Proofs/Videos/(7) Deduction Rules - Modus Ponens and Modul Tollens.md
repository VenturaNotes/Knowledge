	- Deduction Rules: Modus Ponens and modus Tollens
		- A valid argument is a list of premises from which the conclusion follows. How do we know the following argument is valid? If Jon earns $300, then he will buy a new phone. Jon earns $300. Therefore, Jon will buy a new phone.
		- Let's look at the form of the statements. Let P denote "Joe earns $300" and Q denote "Jon will buy a new phone." The logical form of the argument is then:
		- This is an example of a deduction rule, an argument form which is always valid. This one is a famous rule called [[modus ponens]]. To show this deduction rule is always valid, consider the truth table to the right.
		- Notice that all the lines in the deduction rule have their own column in the truth table. An argument is valid provided the conclusion must be true given that the premises are true. The premises in this case are $P \to Q$ and $P$. Which rows of the truth table correspond to both of these being true? P is true in the first two rows, and of those, only the first row has $P \to Q$ true as well. And thus, in this one case, $Q$ is true as well. When all premises are true, the conclusion is true. Therefore, we have a valid deduction rule.

		- Consider the following argument. If you have a current password, then you can log onto the network. You can't log onto the network. Therefore, you don't have a current password. The logical form of the argument is then:
		- This is another example of a [[Deduction rules|deduction rule]], an argument form which is always valid. This one is a particularly famous rule called [[modus tollens]]. To show this deduction rule is always valid, consider the truth table to the right.
		- Notice that all the lines in the deduction rule have their own column in the truth table. Remember that an argument is valid provided the conclusion must be true given that the premises are true. The premises in this case are $P \to Q$ and $\lnot Q$. Which rows of the truth table correspond to both of these being true? $\lnot Q$ is true in the second and fourth rows, and of those, only the fourth row has $P \to Q$ true as well. And thus, in this one case, $\lnot P$ is true as well. We have a valid deduction rule because the conclusion is true when all premises are true.
