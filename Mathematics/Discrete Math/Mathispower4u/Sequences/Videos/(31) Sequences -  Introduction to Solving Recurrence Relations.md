	- Sequences: Solving [[Recurrence Relation|recurrence relations]]
		- A recurrence relation is a recursive definition without the initial conditions.
		- Example: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... The [[fibonacci numbers]] (or [[Fibonacci Numbers|Fibonacci sequence]]), defined recursively by $F_n = F_{n-1} + F_{n-2}$. Including initial conditions (e.g., $F_0 = 0, F_1 = 1$) makes it a recursive definition
