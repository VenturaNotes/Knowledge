	- Sequences: Recursive Definitions
		- Consider the sequence. Determine the following terms
		- Find a recursive formula for the sequence
	- This is why it's always so important to give the initial condition when giving a recursive definition of a function. Here we have two examples of different sequences with the same recurrence relation but the reason they're different is because the initial conditions are different
