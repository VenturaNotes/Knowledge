	- Sequences
		- Given the sequence is $0, 2, 2, 4, 6, 10, 16, 26, 42, ...$ (where $a_n = a_{n-1} + a_{n-2}$ with $a_0 = 0$ and $a_1 = 2)$ 
			- (a) Determine the first few terms of the sequence of the partial sums
			- (b) Determine a formula for $S_n$ expressed in terms of a single term from the sequence given by $a_n$
