	- Arithmetic Sequences
		- Consider the sequence 10, 14, 18, 22, ..., (4n-2)
			- (a) How many terms are there in the sequence? Your answer will be in terms of n
				- In general to find the number of terms in the sequence, take the index of the last term, subtract the index from the first term, and then add 1.
			- (b) What is the second-to-last term (in terms of n)?
			- (c) Find the sum of all the terms in the sequence, in terms of $n$. Use the reverse and add method
