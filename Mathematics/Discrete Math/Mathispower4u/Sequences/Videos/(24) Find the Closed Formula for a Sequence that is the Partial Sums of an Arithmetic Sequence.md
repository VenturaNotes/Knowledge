	- Sequences
		- Consider the sequence 2, 7, 15, 26, 40, 57, ... with $a_0 = 2$. By looking at the differences between terms, express the sequence as a sequence of partial sums $b_n$. Then find a closed formula for the sequence by computing the nth [[partial sum]]
	- Sequences
		- Arithmetic sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14
		- The partial sums give us the terms in the original sequence
