	- Sum of a [[geometric series]]
		- Show that 0.33333.... = $\frac 13.$ Recall $0.\overline{3}$ = $0.33333...$ 
		- You can think of 0.3 repeating as an infinite sum
	- Sum of a geometric series
		- 0.33333.... is a sum of a geometric sequence or geometric series
		- Find the sum using the multiply, shift, and subtract method. Write the sum as an equation. Form another equation by multiplying the first equation by the common ratio. Shift over the products on the right to get the subtraction to mostly cancel out. Subtract and solve for S
