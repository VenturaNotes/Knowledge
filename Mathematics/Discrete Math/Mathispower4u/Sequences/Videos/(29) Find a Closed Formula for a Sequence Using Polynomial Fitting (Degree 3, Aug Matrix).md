	- Polynomial Fitting
		- Use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the nth term of the sequence $(a_n)_{n \ge 0}$, which starts with 3, 6, 12, 22, 37, 58
	- Polynomial Fitting
		- The sequence is cubic: $a_n = an^3 + bn^2 + cn + d$
			- How do you want to solve the system? By hand or with technology?
		- Using augmented matrix to solve the system
			- Don't need to include where the equation $d = 3$
