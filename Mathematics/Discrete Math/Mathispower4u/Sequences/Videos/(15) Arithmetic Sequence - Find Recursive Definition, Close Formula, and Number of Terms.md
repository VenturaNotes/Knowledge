	- Arithmetic Sequences
		- Consider the sequence 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, ... with $a_1 = 5$
		- (a) Give a recursive definition for the sequence.
			- For [[recursive definitions|recursive definition]], we need recurrence relation as well as the initial condition
		- (b) Give a closed formula for the nth term of the sequence
		- (c) Is 2627 a term in the sequence?
			- Since the $n$ found is a natural number, the term is in the sequence
		- (d) How many terms are in the sequence: 5, 8, 11, 14, 17, 20, 23, .., 1568?
		- Notes
			- Arithmetic ($d = a_n - a_{n-1}$)
				- Recursive Definition: $a_n = a_{n-1} + d$
				- Closed Formula: $a_n = a_0 + dn$ or $a_n = a_1 + d(n-1)$
				- Partial Sum: $S = \frac {n+1}{2}(a_0 + a_n)$ or $S = \frac {n}{2} (a_1 + a_n)$
			- Geometric ($r = \frac {a_n}{a_{n-1}}$)
				- Recursive Definition: $a_n = ra_{n-1}$
				- Closed Formula: $a_n = a_0*r^n$ or $a_n = a_1*r^{n-1}$
				- Partial sum: $S = a_0(\frac {1-r^{n+1}}{1-r})$ or $S = a_1(\frac {1-r^{n}}{1-r})$
		- Formula for [[common difference]]: $d = a_n - a_{n-1}$
			- It means we have an arithmetic sequence to find the common difference. We can select any term except the first term and subtract the term before it.
