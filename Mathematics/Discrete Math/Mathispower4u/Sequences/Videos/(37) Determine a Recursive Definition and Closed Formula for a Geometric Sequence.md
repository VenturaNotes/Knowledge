	- Recursive and Closed Formulas for a Geometric Sequence
		- A YouTuber decides to give out free money and make a video of people's reactions. The YouTuber gives out $1 to the first person, $2 to the second person, $4 to the third person, $8 to the fourth person, $16 to the fifth person and so on. Give a recursive definition and a closed formula for how much money the $n^{th}$ person will receive
		- Sequence: $1, 2, 4, 8, 16$
		- $(a_n)_{n \ge 1}$
		- Recursive:
		- Closed:
		- [[Geometric Sequence]]
			- Common ratio: $r = \frac {a_n}{a_{n-1}}$
			- Recurrence Relation: $a_n = a_{n-1} *r$
			- Closed Formulas
				- $a_n = a_0*r^n$ ($a_0$ is the first term)
				- $a_n = a_1*r^{n-1}$ ($a_1$ is the first term)
