	- Recursive and Closed Formulas for a Sequence
		- Consider the sequence $(a_n)_{n \ge 1}$, that starts 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21
		- (a) Give a recursive definition and a closed formula for the sequence
		- (b) Write out the sequence $(b_n)_{n \ge 2}$ of the [[partial sum|partial sums]] of $(a_n)$
		- (c) Write a recursive definition and a closed formula for $(b_n)$ 
	- Key
		- Recursive: $a_n = a_{n-1} +d$
		- Closed: $a_n = a_0 + dn$
		- $a_n = a_1 + d(n-1)$ 
	- No common difference for $(b_n)$
