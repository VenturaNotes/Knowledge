	- Sequences: Recursive Definitions
		- What are the first 5 terms (starting with $a_0$) of the sequence described below? Then determine a closed formula for the sequence
	- Be careful when using one of the closed formulas below since some of them start with $n \ge 1$ while our sequence starts with 0. A solution would be to just start on the $a_1$ term and see which sequence may match up
