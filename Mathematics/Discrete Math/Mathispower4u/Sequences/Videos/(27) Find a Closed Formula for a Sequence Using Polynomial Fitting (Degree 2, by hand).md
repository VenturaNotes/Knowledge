	- Polynomial Fitting
		- Use the polynomial fitting to find the formula for the nth term of the sequence $(a_n)_{n \ge 0}$, which starts with 1, 2, 8, 19, 35
		- Can solve the system of equations using a variety of methods
			- Elimination, substitution, matrix equation, augmented matrix, and graphing
			- Used elimination here
		- Found closed formula for original sequence
