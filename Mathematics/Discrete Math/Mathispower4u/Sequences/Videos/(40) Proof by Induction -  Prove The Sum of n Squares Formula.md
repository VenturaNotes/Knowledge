	- Proof by induction
		- Prove that the sum of n squares can be found as follows
			- (for all natural numbers $n \ge 1$)
		- Proof: For each n, let $P(n)$ be the statement
		- If we can show the right side of the equation of $k$ is in the exact same form as the right side of the equation of $k+1$ instead, we can conclude that P(k+1) is true
	- Proof by Induction
		- Thus P(k+1) is true, completing the inductive case
		- Therefore, by mathematical induction, the statement P(n) is true for all natural numbers $n \ge 1$. QED
