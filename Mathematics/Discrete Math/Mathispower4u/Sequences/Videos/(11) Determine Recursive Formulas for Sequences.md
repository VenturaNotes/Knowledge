	- Sequences: Recursive Definitions
		- Consider the sequences below. For each, find a recursive definition. Are the sequences related?
	- We can define the recurrence relation as the same for all three. So they are all somewhat related since all 3 sequences have the same recurrence relation but different because the initial conditions are different
