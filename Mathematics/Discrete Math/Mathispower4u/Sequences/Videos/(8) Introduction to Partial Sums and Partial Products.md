	- Partial Sums and Partial Products
		- Some sequences naturally arise as the sum of terms of another sequence. Given any sequence $(a_n)_{n \ge 0}$, we can always form a new sequence $(b_n)_{n \ge 0}$ by $$b_n = a_0 + a_1 + a_2 + \cdot\cdot\cdot + a_n$$
		- Since the terms of $(b_n)$ are the sums of the initial part of the sequence $(a_n)$, we call $(b_n)$ the sequence of partial sums of $(a_n)$. Soon we will se that it is sometimes possible to find a closed formula for $(b_n)$ from the closed formula for $(a_n)$. To simplify writing out these sums, we will often use [[sigma notation]]:
			- We do need to pay close attention to the index as this one starts at 1 instead of 0
		- This means add up the $a_k's$ where $k$ changes from 1 to $n$
		- Note that $b_n = b_{n-1} + a_n$
		- If we want to multiply the $a_k's$ instead, we have a partial product and use [[pie notation]]
