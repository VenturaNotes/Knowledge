	- Polynomial Fitting
		- Use polynomial fitting to find the formula for the nth term of the sequence $(a_n)_{n \ge 0}$ which starts 0, 3, 8, 15, 24, 35
		- If the sequence is $\Delta^k$-constant, this means that there is a kth sequence of differences is constant
	- Polynomial Fitting
		- Using augmented matrix to solve a system of equations
