	- Stars and Bars
		- [[Two-line notation]] of function f
			- We have elements of domain in first row. Elements from range in second row which come from codomain. 
		- Consider the function f:
			- (1) How many total functions are there
				- [[Multiplicative Principle]]
			- (2) How many of these functions are strictly increasing? (A function is strictly increasing provided if a < b, then f(a) < f(b))
			- (3) How many of these functions are non-decreasing? (A function is non-decreasing provided if a < b, then f(a) < f(b). Hint: Use Stars and bars)
