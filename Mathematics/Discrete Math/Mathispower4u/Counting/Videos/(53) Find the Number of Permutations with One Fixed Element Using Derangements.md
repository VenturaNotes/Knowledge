	- Permutation with 1 fixed element using derangement
		- How many permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} leave exactly 1 element fixed?
		- Strategy: Find the product of the number of ways to select 1 of the 6 elements to be fixed and the number of derangements of the remaining 5 elements using [[principle of inclusion-exclusion|PIE]]
			- Start with number of permutations first
