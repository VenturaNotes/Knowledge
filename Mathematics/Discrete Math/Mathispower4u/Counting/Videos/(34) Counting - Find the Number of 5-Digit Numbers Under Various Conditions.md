	- Permutations and Combinations
		- Using the digits 2 through 8, find the number of different 5-digit numbers with the given conditions.
			- (1) The digits can be used more than once
				- This is an example of which? Permutation, Combination, or Multiplicative Principle (Counting Principle)
					- Permutation and combination never allow items to be used more than once. So this is the multiplicative principle
				- We know repetition is allowed here
			- (2) The digits cannot be repeated but can be in any order
				- This is an example of which? Permutation, Combination, or Multiplicative Principle (Counting Principle)
					- Since repetition is not allowed but it matters to change order of digits, this is permutation
			- (3) The digits can not be repeated and must be in increasing order.
				- This is an example of which? Permutation, Combination, or Multiplicative Principle (Counting Principle)
					- This is a combination
