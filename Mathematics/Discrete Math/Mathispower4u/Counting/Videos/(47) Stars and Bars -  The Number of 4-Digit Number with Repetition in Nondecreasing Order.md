	- Stars and Bars
		- Using the digits 2 through 8, find the number of different 4-digit numbers under the given conditions. Possible digits: $\{2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8\}$
			- (1) Digits cannot be repeated and must be written in increasing order. For example, 2367 is okay, but 3267 is not.
			- (2) Digits can be repeated and must be written in non-decreasing order. For example, 2448 is okay, but 2484 is not.
