	- A group of college students were asked about their TV watching habits. Of those surveyed, 39 watch `The Walking Dead`, 32 watch `The Blacklist`, and 29 watch `Game of Thrones`. Additionally, 8 watch `The Walking Dead` and `The Blacklist`, 12 watch `The Walking Dead` and `Game of Thrones`, and 11 watch `The Blacklist` and `Game of Thrones`. There are 8 students who watch all three shows. How many watch at least one of the shows?

		- Would pretty much work backwards using the Venn Diagram
	- 77 students watch at least one of the three shows
