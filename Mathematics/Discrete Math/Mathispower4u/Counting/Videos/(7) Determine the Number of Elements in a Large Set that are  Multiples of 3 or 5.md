		- Cardinality of a Union (2 sets): For any finite sets A and B, $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$ 
		- Example: For how many n $\in$ {1, 2, 3, ..., 500} is n a multiple of 3 or 5?
			- If the quotient involves a decimal, always round down
			- There are 233 elements in the given set that are multiples of 3 or 5
