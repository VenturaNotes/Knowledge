	- Cardinality of Unions (Not Disjoint)
		- The cardinality of a set is the number of elements in a set
		- [[Cardinality]] of a [[union]] (2 sets): For any finite sets A and B, $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$ 
			- This still works for disjoint sets but $|A \cap B|$ is just 0
		- The process of adding in, then taking out, then adding back in, and so on is called the [[principle of inclusion-exclusion]], or simply PIE
		- Example: For haw many n $\in$ {1, 2, 3, ..., 30} is n a multiple of 2 or 3?

		- Cardinality of a union (2 sets): For any finite sets A and B,
			- $| A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = |A| + |B|$ 
	- Cardinality of Unions
		- [[Cardinality]] of a [[union]] (2 sets): For any finite sets A and B, $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$.
		- Example: For haw many n $\in$ {1, 2, 3, ..., 30} is n a multiple of 2 or 3?
			- Let A = the set containing multiples of 2 from the set
				- $\frac {30}{2} = 15$
			- Let B = the set containing multiples of 3 from the set
				- $\frac{30}{3} = 10$
			- $A \cap B$ = the set containing multiples of 2 and 3 or multiples of 6
				- $\frac{30}{6} = 5$ 
			- $A \cup B$ = the set containing multiples of 2 or 3
				- So there are 20 elements in the set that are multiples of 2 or 3
