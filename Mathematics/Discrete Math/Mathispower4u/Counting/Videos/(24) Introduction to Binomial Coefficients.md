	- Binomial coefficients
		- [[binomial coefficient|binomial coefficients]] are the coefficients in the expanded version of a binomial, such as $(x+y)^5$. Let's expand $(x+y)^n$ for various values of $n$. Each of these are done by multiplying everything out and then collecting like terms
			- To find the coefficient of $x^3y^2$ is equivalent to asking for the number of bit strings of length 5 with weight 3, when "x" represents the "1" and "y" represents the "0".
				- $n \choose k$ = $|B^n_k|$ is the number of n-bit strings of weight k
				- $n \choose k$ is the coefficient of $x^ky^{n-k}$ in the expansion of $(x+y)^n$
