	- Permutations and Combinations
		- In an attempt to clean up your room, you have purchased a new floating shelf to put some of your 15 books you have stacked in a corner. These books are all by different authors. The new bookshelf is large enough to hold 12 books.
			- (1) How many ways can you select and arrange 12 of the 15 books on the shelf? The books are allowed to be in any order
				- Order matters so using permutations
			- (2) How many ways can you select and arrange 12 of the 15 books on the shelf if you insist they be arranged alphabetically by author?
				- Using combination as no item is used more than once and order does not matter
				- Every group of 12 will only result in one successful outcome in terms of the order of the books (as they need to be arranged alphabetically). Plus we know the books are all by different authors
