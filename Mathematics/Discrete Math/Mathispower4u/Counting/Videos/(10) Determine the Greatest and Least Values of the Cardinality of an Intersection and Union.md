	- Cardinality of Sets
		- Suppose you have sets A and B with |A| = 12 and |B| = 9
		- What is the largest possible value for |A $\cap$ B|?
			- This would happen when B is a [[subset]] of A
			- The Venn diagram that gave us the smallest or least possible value for the cardinality of the intersection is the same diagram that gave us the greatest possible value for the union cardinality
		- What is the smallest possible value for $|A \cap B|?$
			- This means when the sets are [[disjoint]] meaning that they don't share any common elements.
			- The Venn diagram that gave us the greatest possible value for the cardinality of the intersection is the same diagram that gives us the least possible value for the union cardinality
		- What are the possible values for $|A \cup B|?$ 
			- Number of elements in A or B
			- Because of the [[compound inequality]] $x \le |A \cup B| \le y$, we're looking for the greatest or largest possible value on the right and the least or smallest possible value on the left
