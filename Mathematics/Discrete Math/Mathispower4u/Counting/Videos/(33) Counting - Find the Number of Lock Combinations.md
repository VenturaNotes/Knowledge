	- Permutations and Combinations: Combination Lock
		- A combination lock consists of a dial with 30 numbers on it. To open the lock, you turn the dial to the right until you reach a first number, then to the left until you get to the second number, then to the right again to the third number. The numbers must be distinct. How many different lock combinations are possible?
			- Should be called a permutation lock
		- Could use [[multiplicative principle]]
			- The numbers must be distinct
			- #question is this true for all combination locks?
