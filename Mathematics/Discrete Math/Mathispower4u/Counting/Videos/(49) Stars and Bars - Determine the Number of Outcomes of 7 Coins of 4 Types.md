	- Stars and Bars
		- Your friend tells you she has 7 coins in her hand (just pennies (P), nickels (N), dimes (D), and quarters (Q)). If you guess how many of each kind of coin she has, she will give them to you. If you guess randomly, what is the probability that you will be correct? 
			- Every time you form a string of length 10, with the 7 stars and 3 bars, it represents one possible outcome for the 7 coins.
			- Could think this in terms of bit strings where the stars are 0s and the bars are 1s, the number of bit strings of length 10 with 3 1s is $10 \choose 3$
