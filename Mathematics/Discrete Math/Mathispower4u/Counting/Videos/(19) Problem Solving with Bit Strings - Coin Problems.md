	- You break your piggy bank to discover lots of pennies and nickels. You start arranging these in rows of 8 coins.
		- (1) You find yourself making rows containing an equal number of pennies and nickels. For fun, you decide to lay out every possible such row. How many coins will you need?
			- (Hint: You can think of each row as a 8-bit string of weight 4)
			- Will say 0 is a penny and 1 is a nickel
		- (2) How many coins would you need to make all possible rows of 8 coins (not necessarily with an equal number of pennies and nickels)?
