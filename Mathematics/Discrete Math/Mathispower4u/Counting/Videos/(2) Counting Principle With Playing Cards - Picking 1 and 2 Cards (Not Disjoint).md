	- Counting: Additive and Multiplicative Principles with Inclusion/Exclusion
		- (1) How many ways can you select a card which is either red or a face card?
		- (2) How many ways can you select a card which is both red and a face card?
		- (3) How many ways can you select two cards so that the first one is red and the second one is a face card?
			- If A = set of red cards (|A| = 26), B = set of face cards (|B| = 12),
			- $A \cup B$ = set of cards that are red or a face card, $(|A \cup B| = 32)$
			- A $\cap$ B = set of cards that are red and a face card $(|A \cap B| = 6$)
		- 1. Number of cards that are red or a face card $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| = 26 + 12 - 6 = 32$
			- Notice A and B are not disjoint. (not mutually exclusive)
	- Venn Diagram example
		- Need to subtract $A \cap B$ as we've counted the cardinality of the intersection of sets A and B twice. 
	- (2) Number of cards that are red and a face card = $| A \cap B| = 6$ 
	- (3) Number of ways a red card and then a face card ?
		- There are 2 cases to consider
			- Case 1: First red card is not a face card
			- Case 2: The first red card is a face card
		- So we have
			- $20 \cdot 12$ or $6 \cdot 11$ = 240 + 66 = 306
			- 
				- Case 1
					- 20 = Red not a face card
					- 12 = face card
				- Case 2
					- 6 red face cards
					- 11 face cards (after choosing one of the face cards)
			- Using additive principle here
		- Solution is 306 for number of ways of selecting a red card and then a face card
			- #question is this a combination or permutations or separate idea entirely?
