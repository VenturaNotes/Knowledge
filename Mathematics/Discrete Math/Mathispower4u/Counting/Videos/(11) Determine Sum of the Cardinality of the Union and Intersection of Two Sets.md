	- Cardinality of Sets
		- Suppose |A| = 18 and |B| = 9, what is $|A \cup B| + |A \cap B|$
			- We can just manipulate the equation below to answer this question simply using this formula: $|A \cup B| + |A \cap B| = |A| + |B|$
		- There are 3 cases to verify this solution
			- When A and B are disjoint
			- When $B \subseteq A$ 
			- A and B are not disjoint

Equation below: $$|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B| \to |A \cup B| + |A \cap B| = |A| + |B|$$
- For any 2 finite sets A and B, the cardinality of their union is: $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$
- We found that
