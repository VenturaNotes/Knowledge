	- Additive and Multiplicative Principles
		- We usually write numbers in decimal form (or base 10), meaning numbers are composed using 10 different "digits" {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Sometimes though it is useful to write numbers [[hexadecimal]]  or base 16. Now there are 16 distinct digits that can be used to form numbers: {0, 1, ...., 9, A, B, C, D, E, F}. For example, a 3-digit hexadecimal number might be 2B8. How many 2-digit hexadecimals are there in which the first digit is A, B, or C?
