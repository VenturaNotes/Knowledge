	- Problem similar to previous one
	- Additive and Multiplicative Principles
		- We usually write numbers in decimal form (or base 10), meaning numbers are composed using 10 different "digits" {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}. Sometimes though it is useful to write numbers [[hexadecimal]]  or base 16. Now there are 16 distinct digits that can be used to form numbers: {0, 1, ...., 9, A, B, C, D, E, F}. For example, 2B8 is a 3-digit hexadecimal string. How many 2-digit hexadecimals strings start with C-F?
			- Calculate your answer using both the additive and multiplicative methods
			- Additive method (using [[additive principle]])
				- 16 + 16 + 16 + 16
			- Multiplication method (using [[multiplicative principle]])
				- $4*16$
	- Assume 000-FFF are all valid strings
		- How many 3-digit hexadecimal strings start with C-F and end with 2-6?
			- Finding possibilities for each digit
		- How many 3-digit hexadecimal strings start with C-F and end with 2-6?
			- (Start with C-F) + (End with 2-6) - (Start with C-F and End with 2-6)
		- $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$ 
			- A and B are not disjoint
