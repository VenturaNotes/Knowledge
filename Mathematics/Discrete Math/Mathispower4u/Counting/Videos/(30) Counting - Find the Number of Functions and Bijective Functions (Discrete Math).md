	- Permutations and Combinations: Number of Bijective Functions
		- Given $f: \{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\} \to \{a, b, c, d, e, f\}$, how many total functions are there? How many are [[bijective]]?
			- Shows a mapping a set
		- Recall: A bijective function is injective and surjective. which means each element in the codomain must be an image of exactly one element of the domain
		- Let's set up this function using [[two-line notation]]
			- Inputs or elements of domain in the first row
			- Second row has outputs or elements in range which must come from elements in codomain which is the set of elements $\{a, b, c, d, e, f\}$
		- Number of total functions = 
			- Could use [[multiplicative principle]]
				- There were no restrictions here when doing $6*6*6....$ 
		- Number of bijective functions = 
			- P(6,6)
				- Permutation of six items selected 6 at a time or "6 permute 6"
		- Details
			- A function is bijective (injective and surjective) if every element of the codomain is the image of exactly one element from the domain.
			- Bijective functions do not have repeated elements and do not miss elements from the codomain in the range.
			- Combination
				- $n \choose k$ = $C(n,k) = _nC_k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!k!}$ 
				- No item is used more than once
				- The order of items does not matter
			- Permutation
				- $P(n, k) = _nP_k = \frac{n!}{(n-k)!}$
				- No item is used more than once
				- The order of arrangement does matter.
				- $n! = n*(n-1)*(n-2)*...*2*1 =$ permutations of $n$ distinct elements.
