	- Equal Versus Equivalent Sets
		- [[Equal]] sets are identical to each other, meaning they contain the same elements, without regard to order.
		- [[Equivalent]] sets have the same number of elements or same cardinality
			- We use the symbol $A \sim B$ for equivalence
	- Equal Versus Equivalent Sets
		- Determine if the following pairs of sets are equal, equivalent, or neither
			- (1) The set E = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10} and the set F = {fork, spoon, knife, meat thermometer, can opener}
			- (2) The set A is the empty set and set B is the set of prime numbers less than 2
				- The set of [[prime number|prime numbers]] consists of the set of counting numbers greater than one that only have two factors, one and itself. 
					- There are no prime numbers less than two
					- primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, ...}
				- So set A equals set B
				- Also true the two sets are equivalent
					- Equal sets are always equivalent
					- But stating two sets are equal is giving more information
			- (3) The set M is the set of vowels in the word happiness and the set N is the set of consonants in the word happiness
