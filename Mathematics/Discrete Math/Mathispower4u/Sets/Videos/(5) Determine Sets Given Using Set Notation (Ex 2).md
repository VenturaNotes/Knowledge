	- Sets
		- List a few elements in the sets below and describe them in words. The set $\mathbb{Z}$ is the set of integers; positive and negative [[whole numbers]]
			- $\mathbb{N}$ The set of natural numbers. That is $\mathbb{N}$ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
			- $\mathbb{Z}$ The set of integers. That is $\mathbb{Z}$ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
	- Sets
		- First
			- The set of integers such that their square is a natural number. Every integer, when you square it, gives you a non-negative integer, so a natural number. Thus $A = \mathbb{Z}$
		- Second
			- Here we are looking for the set of all $x^2$s where $x$ is a natural number. So this set is simply the set of the squares of the natural numbers. B = {0, 1, 4, 9, 16,...}
			- Another way we could have written this set, using more strict set builder notation, would be as B  = {x $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$: x = $n^2$ for some n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$}
