	- Relationship Between Sets
		- Let A, B, C, and D. Determine which of the following are true, false, or meaningless
			- (1) False
				- False. For example, 1 $\in$ A but 1 $\notin$ B
			- (2) True
				- True. Every element in B is an element of A
			- (3) False
				- False. The set {2, 4, 6} is not an element in C
			- (4) False
				- A has exactly 6 elements, and none of them are the empty set
			- (5) True
				- Everything in the empty set (nothing) is also an element of A. Notice that the empty set is a subset of every set.
			- (6) Meaningless
				- A set cannot be less than another set
			- (7) True
				- 3 is one of the elements of the set C
			- (8) Meaningless
				- 3 is not a set, so it cannot be a subset of another set
			- (9) True
				- 3 is the only element of the set {3}, and is an element of C, so every element in {3} is an element of C
