	- Relationships Between Sets
		- Let A = {1, 2, 3}. Find $\mathcal{P}(A)$
			- Then determine the cardinality of $\mathcal{P}(A)$
		- $\mathcal{P}(A)$ The [[power set]] of any set A is the set of all subsets of A
		- $\varnothing$ The [[empty set]] is the set which contains no elements. Also, denoted by {}. The empty set is a subset and proper subset of every set
		- $|A|$ or $n(A)$: The [[cardinality]] (or size) of A is the number of distinct elements in A
	- Relationships Between Sets
		- Notice that while 2 $\in$ A, it is wrong to write 2 $\in$ $\mathcal{P}(A)$ since none of the elements in $\mathcal{P}(A)$ are numbers! On the other hand, we do have {2} $\in$ $\mathcal{P}(A)$ because {2} $\subseteq$ A.
		- Now let's consider the cardinality of P(A). How many elements are in P(A)? The elements are sets.
			- $|P(A)| = 8$
