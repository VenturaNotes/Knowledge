	- Sets: [[Intersection]], [[Union]], [[Difference]]
		- Let A = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8} and B ={2, 3, 4, 6, 7}. Find each of the following sets
		- $\cap$ 
			- A $\cap$ B is the intersection of A and B: the set containing all elements which are elements of both A and B
		- $\cup$
			- A $\cup$ B is the union of A and B: is the set containing all elements which are elements of A or B or both
		- $\backslash$
			- A $\backslash$ B is A [[set-minus]] B: The set containing all elements of A which are not elements of B
				- #question is set-minus symbol significant?
