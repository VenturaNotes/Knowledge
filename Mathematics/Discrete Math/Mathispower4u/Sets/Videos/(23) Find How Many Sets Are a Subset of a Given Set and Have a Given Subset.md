	- Sets: Subsets
		- Given A and B, how many sets C exist such that C $\subseteq$ A and B $\subseteq$ C
			- Notice that all of the elements of B are elements of A. If this was not the case, C would not exist. If B did have an element not an element of A and B $\subseteq$ C then C $\nsubseteq$ A.
			- Since B $\subseteq$ C, all of the elements of B must be elements of C. 2, 4, and 5 must be elements of C. We also have C $\subseteq$ A. In order to satisfy both conditions, we need to find the subsets of A that always contain the elements 2, 4, 5
