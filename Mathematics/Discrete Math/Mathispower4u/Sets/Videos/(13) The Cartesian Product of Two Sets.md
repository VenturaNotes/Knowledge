	- Cartesian product of two sets
		- Let A and B. Find A $\times$ B and $A \times A$. How many elements do you expect to be in $B \times B$?
			- The cartesian product of A and A ($A \times A$) is sometimes referred to as A squared
		- $\times$ 
			- $A \times B$ is the [[Cartesian product]] of A and B: the set of all ordered pairs (a, b) with a $\in$ A and b $\in$ B
				- $A \times B = \{(a,b): a \in A \land b \in B\}$
		- $|B \times B|$ = $3*3$ = 9
			- The cartesian product of B squared would be a set containing 9 ordered pairs or 9 elements
