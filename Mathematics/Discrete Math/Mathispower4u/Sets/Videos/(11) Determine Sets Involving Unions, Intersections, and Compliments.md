	- Operations on Sets
		- Let A, B, C, and D. If the universe $u$, find below
			- (1) {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
				- Can think of union of two sets as combining both sets but we don't list elements more than once
			- (2) {2, 4, 6}
			- (3) {2}
			- (4) {}
			- (5) {5,7,8,9,10}
			- (6) {1,3,5}
				- A $\setminus$ B is the same as A $\cap$ $\overline B$ 
			- (7) {1,3,5,7,8,9,10}
			- (8) {1, 2, 3}
			- (9) {}
