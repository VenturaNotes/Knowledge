	- [[Rooted Trees]]
		- If we designate $f$ as the root, then $e, h, \text{ and } i$ are the children of $f$, and are siblings of each other.
			- Among the other things we can say that $a$ is a child of $c$, and a descendant of $f$
			- The vertex $g$ is a descendent of $f$, in fact, is a grandchild of $f$
			- Vertices $g$ and $d$ are siblings, since they have the common parent e
		- Notice how things change if $a$ is the root. The lone child $c$, which also has only one child, namely $e$
			- We would then have $f$ the child of $e$ (instead of the other way around), and $f$ is the descendant of $a$, instead of the ancestor.
			- $f$ and $g$ are now siblings
