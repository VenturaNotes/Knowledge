	- Graph Theory: Trees
		- Consider the tree drawn below
		- Suppose $e$ is not chosen as the root. Does our choice of root vertex change the number of children $e$ has? The number of grandchildren? How many are there of each?
		- If $e$ is the root, $e$ has 2 children. However, if $e$ is not chosen as the root, $e$ will always have 1 child. As a result, the number of children $e$ has will not change if $e$ is not the root
			- #comment I think it's trying to say that the number of children $e$ has will not change no matter what the root is aside from $e$ being the root.
		- Similarly, if $e$ is not chosen as a root, it will not change the number of grandchildren $e$ has. $e$ will always have 3 grandchildren
