	- Graph theory: Trees
		- Consider the tree drawn below
			- (a) Suppose we designate vertex $e$ as the root. List the children, parents, and siblings of each vertex. Does any vertex other than $e$ have grandchildren?
		- If two vertices are adjacent, then we say one of them is the [[parent]] and the other is the [[child]]. The parent vertex is always closer to the root. [[Sibling|Siblings]] are vertices with the same parent. Siblings are never adjacent. A [[grandchild]] is a child of a child
		- Only root $e$ has grandchildren. It is the only vertex whose children have children
