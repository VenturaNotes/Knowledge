	- [[Planar Graph|planar graphs]]
		- When a connected graph can be drawn without any edges crossing, it is called planar. When a planar graph is drawn in this way, it divides the plane into regions called [[faces]]
		- Even if a graph does not look like it is planar, it still might be. Perhaps we can redraw it in a way in which no edges cross. For example, the graph below is planar because it can be redrawn as the graph on the right.
