	- Largest Number of Edges in a Graph
		- What is the largest number of edges possible in a graph with 7 vertices?
			- Degree sum
			- $K_7$ can be said as "k seven" or "k sub-seven"
			- When looking for largest, we want complete graph
		- What is the largest number of edges possible in a bipartite graph with 7 vertices?
			- Degree sum
			- When looking for largest, we want complete bipartite graph
			- The number of edges in $K_{1, 6}$ is 6 which is not the largest number possible
		- What is the largest number of edges possible in a tree with 7 vertices?
			- Degree sum
			- In this case, it doesn't really matter which tree we sketch
			- The number of edges in a tree with n vertices is always n-1 edges.
	- [[Handshake Lemma]] (degree sum formula)
		- In any graph, the sum of the degrees of vertices in the graph is always twice the number of edges
		- A graph is complete if every pair of vertices is connected by one edge and only 1 edge
		- A graph is bipartite if the vertices can be divided into two sets, A and B, with no two vertices in A adjacent and no two vertices in B adjacent. $K_{m, n}$, where |A| = m and |B| = n
		- In a complete bipartite graph, each vertex in A is adjacent to every vertex in B
		- A connected graph with no cycles is a [[tree]].
			- Recall, a [[cycle]] is a path that starts and stops at the same vertex
