	- Which graphs are trees?
		- Which of the following graphs are trees?
			- A [[tree]] is a connected graph containing no cycles (acyclic)
				- e = v -1
					- The number of edges is equal to the number of vertices - 1
					- If equation is not true, then graph not a tree
						- If true, then we need to make sure graph is connected and has no cycles 
			- Recall:  A graph is connected if you can get from any vertex to any other vertex by following some path of edges
			- Recall: A cycle is a path that starts and stops at the same vertex
	- Solving
		- (a) Not a tree because $e = v-1$ not true
		- (b) Tree because satisfies equation, is connected, and no cycles
		- (c) Tree similar to reasons of (b)
		- (d) Not a tree similar to reason of (a)
