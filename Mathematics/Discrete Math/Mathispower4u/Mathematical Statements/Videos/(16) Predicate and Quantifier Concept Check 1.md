	- Predicates and Quantifiers
		- For question B, we can say true because even though we don't know the domain of discourse for x, we do know that one of the values is 5 which will make the statement true as an `x` exists to make the statement true. 
		- For question C, we don't know the domain of discourse so it could be true or it could be false. True if the domain is just 5. False if the domain was the set of natural numbers since `x=2` would make the statement $P(2)$ false
	- Universal and Existential Quantifiers
		- The existential quantifier is $\exists$ and is read "there exists" or "there is"
		- The universal quantifier is $\forall$ and is read "for all" or "every"
