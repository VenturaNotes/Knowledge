	- What is [[discrete math|discrete mathematics]]?
		- Discrete mathematics is the branch of mathematics dealing with objects that can assume only countable or otherwise distinct separated values. For example, the number of integers from 1 to 5.
		- In contrast, [[continuous mathematics]] is the branch of mathematics dealing with objects that assume uncountable values. For example, the number of real numbers from 1 to 5.
		- [[Discrete]] objects are often characterized by integers. [[Continuous]] objects require real numbers
		- We will study four main topics: [[combinatorics]] (the theory of ways things combine; in particular, how to count these ways), [[Sequence|sequences]], [[symbolic logic]], and [[graph theory]]. However, there are other topics that belong under the discrete umbrella, including computer science, abstract algebra, number theory, game theory, probability and geometry. Some of these, particularly the last two, have both discrete and non-discrete variants.
	- Here is a specific example
		- In an algebra or calculus class, you might have found a particular set of numbers (maybe the set of numbers in the range of a function). You would represent this set as an interval: $[0, \infty)$ is the range of $f(x) = x^2$ since the set of outputs of the function are all real numbers 0 and greater. This set of numbers is NOT discrete. The numbers in the set are not separated by much at all. In fact, take any two numbers in the set and there are infinitely many more between them which are also in the set.
		- Discrete math could still ask about the range of a function, but the set would not be an interval. Consider the function which gives the number of children of each person reading this. What is the range? I'm guessing it is something like {0, 1, 2, 3}. Maybe 4 is in there too. But certainly, there is nobody reading this that has 1.32419 children. This output set is discrete because the elements are separate. The inputs to the function also form a discrete set because each input is an individual person.
