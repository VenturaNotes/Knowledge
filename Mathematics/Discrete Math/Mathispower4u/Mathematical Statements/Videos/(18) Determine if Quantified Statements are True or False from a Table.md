	- Suppose $P(x, y)$ is some binary predicate defined on a very small domain of discourse, just the integers 1, 2, 3, and 4. For each of the 16 pairs of these numbers, $P(x,y)$ is either true or false, according to the following table (x values are rows, y values are columns). For example, $P(1, 3)$ is false, as indicated by the F in row 1, column 3
	- Use the table to decide whether the following statements are true or false
		- (a) This is just asking to find at least one true in each row
		- (b) Checking that each column has a true
		- (c) checking if there is a row for all true
		- (d) Entire column true
			- Or there is a false at least once in each column which shows the negation true (shown in image)
