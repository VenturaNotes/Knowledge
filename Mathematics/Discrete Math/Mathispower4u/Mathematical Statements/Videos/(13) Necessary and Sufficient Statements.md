	- Necessary and Sufficient Statements
		- [[Necessary]] and [[Sufficient]]
			- "P is necessary for Q" means $Q \to P$
				- "P is a necessary condition for Q"
			- "P is sufficient for Q" means $P \to Q$
			- If P is necessary and sufficient for Q, then $P \leftrightarrow Q$
		- Example 0.2.9
			- Recall from calculus, if a function is differentiable at a point c, then it is continuous at c, but that the converse of this statement is not true. As an example, consider f(x) = |x| at (0, 0). Restate this fact using "necessary and sufficient" language
				- Converse: If a function is continuous at c, then it is differentiable at c
					- This converse statement is not true
			- Continuity does not imply differentiability but differentiability implies continuity 
		- It is true that for a function to be differentiable at a point c, it is necessary for the function to be continuous at c. However, it is not necessary that a function be differentiable at c for it to be continuous at c
		- It is true that to be continuous at a point c, it is sufficient that the function be differentiable at c. However, it is not the case that being continuous at c is sufficient for a function to be differentiable at c.
