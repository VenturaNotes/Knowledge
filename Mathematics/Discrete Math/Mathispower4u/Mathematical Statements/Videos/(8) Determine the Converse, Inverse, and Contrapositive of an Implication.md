	- Converse, Inverse, and Contrapositive of an Implication
		- Consider the statement "If Trina runs, then she drinks a sports drink"
			- (1) What is the [[converse]] of the original statement?
				- If Trina drinks a sports drink, then she runs
			- (2) What is the [[contrapositive]] of the original statement?
				- If Trina does not drink a sports drink, then she does not run
			- (3) What is the [[inverse]] of the original statement?
				- If Trina does not run, then she does not drink a sports drink
		- [[Inverse]] is obtained by implying that the negation of the hypotheses implies the negation of the conclusion: $\lnot P \to \lnot Q$.
			- The inverse is not logically equivalent to the original implication. It is logically equivalent to the converse.
