	- Converse and Contrapositive of an Implication
		- Note first that whenever $P \to Q$ and P are both true statements, Q must be true as well. For this problem, take P to mean "Sue gets a 93% or greater on her final" and Q to mean "Sue will get an A in the class"
		- (1) We have P $\to$ Q and P, so Q follows. Sue gets an A in the class
		- (2) We have $P \to Q$ and Q. Nothing follows by knowing Q is true. Sue could have gotten the A because she did extra credit. We do not know (Q $\to$ P) that if Sue gets an A in the class, then she gets a 93% or greater on her final. That is the converse of the original implication, so it might or might not be true
		- (3) Here we have P $\to$ Q and $\lnot P$. $\lnot P$ states Sue does not get a 93% or greater on the final. $\lnot P$ does not imply $\lnot Q$. Again, we can conclude nothing. Sue many get an A in the class by doing extra credit. Sue may also not get an A in the class. We can not conclude anything
		- (4) Here we have $P \to Q$ and $\lnot Q$. $\lnot Q$ is the negation of the conclusion of the original implication. We know the contrapositive of the original implication $(\lnot Q \to \lnot P)$ has the same truth value as the original implication $(P \to Q)$. As a result, we know $\lnot Q \to \lnot P$ is true as well. If Sue does not get an A in the class, we can conclude she did not get 93% or greater on her final.
