	-  Predicates and Quantifiers
		- Question B is true or false because we don't know the domain of discourse for x
			- We don't know this because we haven't found an `x` yet where P(x) is true
		- Question C is false
			- $\forall x P(x)$ is saying that all values of `x` will make $P(x)$ true which is false since $P(5)$ is false
			- A common way to show that a given quantified statement is false is to show that the negation is true
				- The negation is that there exists an x such that P(x) is false
					- $\exists x \lnot P(x)$ 
				- Since the negation is true, we know the original quantified statement is false
