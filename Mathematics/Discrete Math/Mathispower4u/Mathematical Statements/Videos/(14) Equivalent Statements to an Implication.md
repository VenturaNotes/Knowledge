	- Rephrasing an implication
		- Rephrase the implication in equivalent ways.
			- If it is raining, then I use an umbrella
				- $P \to Q$
			- All of the following are equivalent
				- if P then Q
				- If P, Q
					- If it is raining, I use an umbrella
				- P is sufficient for Q
					- It is raining is sufficient for me to use an umbrella
				- Q if P
					- I use an umbrella if it is raining
				- Q when P
					- I use an umbrella when it is raining
				- Q whenever P
					- I use an umbrella whenever it is raining
				- Q is necessary for P
					- I use an umbrella is necessary for it to be raining
				- A necessary condition for P is Q
					- A necessary condition for it to be raining is that I use an umbrella
				- Q unless $\lnot P$
					- I use an umbrella unless it is not raining
				- P implies Q
					- It is raining implies I use an umbrella
				- P only if Q
					- It is raining only if I use an umbrella
				- P is sufficient for Q (duplicate)
					- It is raining is sufficient for me to use an umbrella
				- P is a sufficient condition for Q
					- It is raining is a sufficient condition for me to use an umbrella
				- Q follows from P
					- I use an umbrella follows from it is raining
				- $\lnot Q \to \lnot P$ (contrapositive)
					- If I don't use an umbrella, then it is not raining
				- $P \to Q \equiv \lnot P \lor Q$ 
					- It's not raining, or I use an umbrella
		- [[Implication]]: $P \to Q$
		- [[Converse]]: $Q \to P$
		- [[Contrapositive]]: $\lnot Q \to \lnot P$
		- An implication is true unless P is true, and Q is false
