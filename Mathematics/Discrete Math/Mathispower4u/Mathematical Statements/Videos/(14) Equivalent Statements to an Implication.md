	- Rephrasing an implication
		- Rephrase the implication in equivalent ways.
			- If it is raining, then I use an umbrella
				- $P \to Q$
			- All of the following are equivalent
				- if P then Q
				- If P, Q
				- P is sufficient for Q
				- Q if P
				- Q whenever P
				- Q is necessary for P
				- A necessary condition for P is Q
				- Q unless $\lnot P$
				- P implies Q
				- P only if Q
				- P is sufficient for Q
				- P is a sufficient condition for Q
				- Q follows from P
				- $\lnot Q \to \lnot P$ (contrapositive)
				- $P \to Q \equiv \lnot P \lor Q$
