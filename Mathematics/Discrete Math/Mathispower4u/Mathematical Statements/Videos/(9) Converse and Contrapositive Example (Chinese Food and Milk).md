	- Converse and Contrapositive of an Implication
		- Consider the statement "If Oscar eats Chinese food, then he drinks milk"
		- (1) If Oscar drinks milk, then he eats Chinese food
		- (2) If Oscar does not drink milk, then he does not eat Chinese food
		- (3) The contrapositive has the same truth value of the original implication. If the original implication is false, then the contrapositive is false
		- (4) Knowing Oscar drinks milk does not give additional information. Knowing $P \to Q$ and Q does not indicate the converse $Q \to P$ is true. $Q \to P$ can be true or false
		- (5) We can conclude that Oscar does not eat Chinese food. $P \to Q$ is true then $\lnot Q \to \lnot P$ is also true. If Oscar doesn't drink milk, then he doesn't eat Chinese food
