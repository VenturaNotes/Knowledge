	-  Determining Truth Values from an Implication
		- In my safe is a sheet of paper with two shapes drawn on it in colored crayon. One is a square, and the other is a triangle. Each shape is drawn in a single color. Suppose you believe me when I tell you that if the square is blue, then the triangle is green. What do you therefore know about the truth value of the following statements?
			- P = The square is blue
			- Q = The triangle is green
				- P $\to$ Q
			- (a) False
			- (b) Not enough information
				- Knowing the square is not blue is not enough information to determine that the square and triangle are both green. We cannot make a conclusion about statement 2
			- (c) True
				- Contrapositive (has same truth value of original implication)
			- (d) Not enough information
				- Converse (may or may not have the same truth value as the original implication)
			- (e) True
				- So either the first or second statement is true and therefore the disjunction is true
		- Terms
			- [[Implication]]
			- [[Converse]]
			- [[Contrapositive]]
		- Here we have 3 cases. Let's consider all 3
			- If the square is blue, then the triangle is green
			- If the square is not blue, then the triangle is green
			- If the square is not blue, then the triangle is not green
			- False: If the square is blue, then the triangle is not green
