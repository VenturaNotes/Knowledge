		- [[Implication|Implications]]
			- An implication or conditional is a molecular statement of the form $P \to Q$ where P and Q are statements. We say that
				- P is the [[hypothesis]] (or antecedent)
				- Q is the [[conclusion]] (or consequent)
			- An implication is true provided P is false or Q is true (or both), and false otherwise. In particular, the only way for $P \to Q$ to be false is for P to be true and Q to be false
	- Implications and Truth Conditions for Implications
		- Examples
			- [[Pythagorean Theorem]]
				- Note: Q $\to$ P ([[converse]]) is also a true statement. If follows $P \iff Q$
		- [[Implication]]
			- True if P is false or Q is true or both
			- False only when P is true and Q is false
	- Implications and Truth Conditions for Implications
		- It is important to understand the conditions under which an implication is true not only to decide whether a mathematical statement is true, but in order to prove that it is. Proofs might seem scary, but all we are really doing is explaining (very carefully) why a statement is true. If you understand the truth conditions for an implication, you already have the outline for a proof.
		- [[direct proof|Direct proofs]] of [[Implication|implications]]:
			- To prove an implication $P \to Q$, it is enough to assume P, and from it, deduce Q
		- Example
			- Prove: If a number a is even, then $a^2$ is even
			- Proof: A number is even, if 2 is a factor of the number. Since it is given that a is even, then a = 2k for some integer k. We thus have $a^2$ = $(2k)^2$ = $4k^2$ = $2(2k^2)$. Since 2 is a [[factor]] of $a^2$, then $a^2$ is even. QED
				- #question Not sure if the "2 is a factor of $a^2$ is said correctly but maybe
				- [[QED]] usually stands for the latin phrase quod erat demonstrandum, which translates to "which was to be demonstrated"
