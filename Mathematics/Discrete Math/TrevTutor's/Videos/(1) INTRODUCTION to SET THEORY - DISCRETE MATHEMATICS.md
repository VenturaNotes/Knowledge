- Set Theory
	- A set is a collection of objects called elements
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 4.40.56 AM.png]]
			- Sets can be represented visually or with list notation
	- Sets can be finite or infinite.
		- A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
		- $\mathbb{Z}^+ = \{1, 2, 3, 4, ...\}$
			- This is a set of positive integers where the 3 dots means it's an implied pattern that goes on forever.
- Additional Points
	- Repeated elements are listed once
		- {a, b, a, c, b, a} = {a, b, c}
			- Both are the same sets
			- Visual

	- There is no order in a set.
		- {3, 2, 1} = {1, 2, 3}
- Common Sets
	- Natural Numbers
		- $\mathbb{N}$ = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...} OR {1, 2, 3, ...} => $\mathbb{Z}^+$ 
	- Integers
		- $\mathbb{Z}$ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
			- Set of whole numbers that are positive or negative
	- Rational Numbers
		- $\mathbb{Q}$ = {..., 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, ...}
			- They can be negative
			- Real numbers are both rational and irrational
- Elements and cardinality
	- Let C = {yellow, blue, red}
		- "yellow is an element of C"
			- yellow $\in$ C
		- "Green is not an element of C"
			- Green $\notin$ C
		- "The cardinality of C is 3"
			- |C| = 3
	- The $\in$ is an epsilon symbol
- The empty set
	- $\varnothing$ = { }
	- $|\varnothing|$ = 0
	- $|\{\varnothing\}| = 1$ 
		- |{ }| = 0
	- For {$\varnothing$}
		- $\varnothing$ is an element of the set above
	- Sets can have sets as elements
- Set-Builder Notation (predicate notation)
	- Q = {..., 1/1, 1/2, 1/3, 2/3, ...} (below is a better way to express the entire set)
		- = {$\frac mn$ | m, n $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, n $\ne$ 0} 
			- The left of | is the form that it takes and the right side is the rule
			- Define elements as variables. Set containing elements $\frac mn$ such that m and n have to be integers and n $\ne$ 0. This expresses entire set of rational #'s.
	- Even Integers
		- $2\mathbb{Z}$ = {..., -4, -2, 0, 2, 4, ...}
			- = {2n | n $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$ }
				- If we take "n" to be 1, we get 2 back. If n=2, then we get 4. If n=-1, we get -2
- Desk = {drink, laptop, microphone}
	- {x | x is on my desk}
- Exercises
	- Given D = {x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}^+$ | x < 6}
		- List the elements of D
			- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
		- What is the cardinality of D?
			- |D| = 5
		- What is the cardinality of {$\varnothing$ , {a,b}}
			- Stuff inside boxes in a cardinality question doesn't matter
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-22 at 5.02.51 AM.png]]
			- |{$\varnothing$ , {a,b}}| = 2
		- A few more cardinality examples
