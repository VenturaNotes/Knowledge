- Cartesian Products
	- An ordered pair (a,b) is a set
		- {{a}, {a,b}}
		- {a} is a singleton in the set
		- Ordered pair is a definition that will be used for proofs
	- You've seen ordered pairs as graph coordinates
		- (1,2) = {{1}, {1,2}}
		- (2,1) = {{2}, {2,1}}
		- (-2, 0)
		- Visual

- The Cartesian Product, A $\times$ B, is the set $$\{(a,b) | a \in A \text{ and } b \in B\}$$
