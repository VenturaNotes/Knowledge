- Quantifiers we've learned
	- Let P(x) be the statement "x has taken a course in programming" for the domain of students in your class.
	- $\forall x P(x)$ 
		- Every student in my class has taken a course in programming
	- $\exists x P(x)$ 
		- There is a student in my class who has taken a course in programming
- Negating Quantifiers
	- Let P(x) be the statement "x has taken a course in programming" for the domain of students in your class
	- $\lnot \forall x P(x)$ 
		- There is a student in my class who hasn't taken a course in programming
			- $\exists x \lnot P(x)$ 
	- $\lnot \exists x P(x)$ 
		- All students in my class have not taken a course in programming
			- $\forall \lnot P(x)$ 
- De Morgan's Law for quantifiers
	- $\lnot \exists x P(x) \equiv \forall x \lnot P(x)$ 
		- True when P(x) is false for every x
		- False when there is an x for which P(x) is true
	- $\lnot \forall x P(x) \equiv \exists x \lnot P(x)$
		- True when there is an x for which P(x) is false
		- False when P(x) is true for every x
- Translating and Negating
	- Negate the statements
		- "There is an honest politician"
			- H(x) represents "x is honest" for domain of all politicians
				- $\exists x H(x)$ 
					- There exists a politician such that politician is honest
			- $\lnot \exists x H(x) \equiv \forall x \lnot H(x)$ 
				- Every politician is dishonest
		- "All Americans eat cheeseburgers"
			- C(x) represents "x eats cheeseburgers" for domain of all Americans
				- $\forall x H(x)$
			- $\lnot \forall x C(x) \equiv \exists \lnot C(x)$ 
				- Not every American eats cheeseburgers
- Translating
	- Some student in this class has visited Mexico
		- Domain
			- Students in class
				- M(x) represents "x has visited Mexico"
				- $\exists x M(x)$ 
		- Domain
			- All people
				- M(x) represents "x has visited Mexico"
				- C(x) represents "x is a student in this class"
				- $\exists x (M(x) \land C(x))$
	- Domain or universe
- Practice
	- Every student in this class has visited Canada or Mexico.
		- Domain
			- Students in this class
				- M(x) represents "x has visited Mexico"
				- C(x) represents "x has visited Canada"
				- $\forall x (C(x) \lor M(x))$
		- Domain
			- All people
				- S(x) represents "x is a student in this class"
				- $\forall x(S(x) \implies (C(x) \lor M(x)))$
