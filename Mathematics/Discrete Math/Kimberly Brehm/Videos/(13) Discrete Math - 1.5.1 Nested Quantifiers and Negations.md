- Every real number has an additive inverse
	- $\forall x \exists y (x + y = 0)$
		- Is this true?
		- Domain - all real #'s
			- x = {0, 1, 2}
		- reasoning & proof
			- 0 + 0 = 0
			- 1 + -1 = 0
			- 2 + -2 = 0
- Let P(x, y) denote "xy=yx". Assume the domain is the real numbers
	- 1) is $\forall x \forall y P(x,y)$ true?
		- Read as "for all real number x and for all real numbers y"
		- xy = yx
		- True
	- 2) Is $\forall y \forall x P(x,y)$ true?
		- Read as "for all real numbers y and for all real numbers x"
		- True
	- The first statement is true because of the commutative property of multiplication. Not through a formal proof though. Order doesn't matter.

		- $\forall x \forall y P(x,y)$
			- Just need a counterexample
		- $\forall x \exists y P(x,y)$ 
			- The y in $\exists y$ does not need to be the same # for $\forall x$
