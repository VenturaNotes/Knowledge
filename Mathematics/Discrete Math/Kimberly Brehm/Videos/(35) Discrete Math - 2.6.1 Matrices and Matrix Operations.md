- Matrices
	- A rectangular array of numbers. A matrix with m rows and n columns is called an $m\text{ x }n$ matrix.

- Matrix Addition (and Subtraction)
	- Matrices of the same size can be added by finding the sum of elements of the same address.

- Matrix multiplication
	- Matrices M and N can be multiplied if M is a $m \text{ x } k$ matrix and N is a $k \text { x } n$ matrix. The resulting product matrix will be an $m \text{ x } n$ matrix

		- 2B is scalar multiplication
- Identity Matrix ($A * I = A$ )
	- The identity matrix is a square matrix $I_n = \delta_{ij}$ where $\delta_{ij} = 1$ if i=j and $\delta_{ij} =0$ if i $\ne$ j. (First diagonal is 1's and all other elements are 0).

		- $\delta$ is lowercase delta
- Transpose of Matrices
	- The transpose of $A_{m\text{ x }n}$ denoted $A^t$ is the $n \text{ x }m$ matrix obtained by interchanging the rows and columns of A - If A=$A^t$ the A is symmetric.
