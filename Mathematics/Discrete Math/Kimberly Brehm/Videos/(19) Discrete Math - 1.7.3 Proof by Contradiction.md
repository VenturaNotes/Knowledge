- Proof by contradiction
	- In this method of proof, we assume a proposition is not true, then through that premise and logic find a contradiction that shows our original premise must have been incorrect, and therefore, the proposition was true.
	- For one proposition, p, assume $\lnot$ p is true, then find a contradiction that shows $\lnot p$ is false, so p is true
	- For an implication, p $\implies$ q assume p and $\lnot$ q are true, then find a contradiction that shows either $p \implies q$ or $\lnot q \implies \lnot p$

		- When writing proofs, looking at definition of terms can help you solve such as for a rational #.
		- In $2b^2 = a^2$, we know $2b^2$ is even because 2 multiplied by any # gives an even. And any squared # that's even has a base even # so a is even
		- The reason "no common factors" is mentioned is b/c coprime guarantees that 4/2 can't be simplified to 2. No further simplification possible.
