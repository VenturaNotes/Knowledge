	- Slide 1
		- Conversion between binary, octal and hexadecimal
			- Going from binary expansion to octal and hexadecimal
			- Find the octal and hexadecimal expansions of $(11 1110 1011)_2$
			- Octal is base 8 which is $2^3$
			- Hexadecimal is base 16 which is $2^4$
			- If you end up with some values that needs 0s to the left, add them
				- For octal, want to split binary into groups of 3
				- For hexadecimal, can keep binary in groups of 4
	- Slide 2
		- Conversion between binary, octal and hexadecimal
			- Going from octal expansion to binary and decimal
			- Find the binary expansion of $(37274)_8$
				- Binary is $2^1$ 
				- Octal $2^3$ Represents 3 binary values.
			- Find the hexadecimal expansion of $(37274)_8$
				- Need to go from octal to binary to hexadecimal to solve above question.
	- Slide 3
		- Conversion between binary, octal and hexadecimal
			- Converting hexadecimal to binary and octal. 
			- Find the binary expansion of $(A8D)_{16}$
			- Find the octal expansion of $(A8D)_{16}$
				- Have to go from hexadecimal to binary to octal
	- Slide 4
		- Operations on base `n` numbers
			- Find the sum and product of $(1011)_2$ and $(011)_2$
