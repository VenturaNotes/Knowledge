- Premises are always true?
	- A valid argument cannot have all true premisses and a false conclusion. So if a valid argument does have a false conclusion, it cannot have all true premises [^1]
- Argument
	- A sequence of propositions $P_1, P_2 ...$ 
		- The above are premises
		- $(p_1 \land p_2 \land p_3 ... \land p_n) \implies q$
			- This is the conclusion
- Valid argument
	- The premises imply the conclusion
	- If it is a tautology (always true), it is a valid argument
- Example

		- If it is raining, I will need an umbrella. 
			- It is raining
			- $\therefore$ I will need an umbrella
				- $\therefore$ means therefore
- Rules of Inference
	- Modus Ponens
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-17 at 7.38.23 PM.png|300]]
		- The solution is written as a tautology
	- Modus Tollens
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-17 at 7.38.39 PM.png|300]]
	-  Hypothetical Syllogism
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-17 at 7.39.52 PM.png|300]]
		- It is like the transitive property
	- Disjunctive Syllogism

	- Addition
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-17 at 7.41.28 PM.png]]
			- Solution is a corresponding tautology
	- Simplification

	- Conjunction

	- Resolution

- Examples
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-17 at 7.43.27 PM.png]]
		- The rules of inference are for building a valid argument
		- Must show conclusion is true
