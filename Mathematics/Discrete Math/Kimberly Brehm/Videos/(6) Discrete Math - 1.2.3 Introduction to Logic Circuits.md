- Course doesn't cover a lot from this topic
- Great way to present visually a propositional logic statement
- What is a logic circuit?
	- A circuit designed to perform complex tasks designed in terms of elementary logic functions. Three 'gates' are used implementing a boolean function on one or more binary inputs producing one output.

				- Line is curved
		- And Gate

				- Line is Straight
	- A logic gate is a device is a device that acts as a building block for digital circuits. They perform basic logical functions that are fundamental to digital circuits. [^1]
- Determine the output of each logic gate in the circuit

			- To do this correctly, you need to make sure you give the output for each logic gate in the circuit.
- Construct a logic circuit for $(p\land\lnot r) \lor (\lnot q \land s)$

			- When drawing yourself, you don't need to put the outputs like in our last example. Just helpful.
			- All the parts in blue and orange are necessary. Not the parts in white. Just looking for drawing more
