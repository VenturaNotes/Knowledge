- Methods of Identity Proof:
	- 1) Prove each set in the identity is a subset of the other
	- 2) Use propositional logic - 2 column
	- 3) Use a membership table showing the same combination of sets do or don't belong to the identity

- Example

		- De Morgan's Second Law
		- Steps
			- By assumption
			- Definition of complement
			- Definition of intersection
			- De Morgan for Propositional Logic
			- Definition of negation
			- Definition of complement
			- Definition of Union 
		- "Union" is the same as "or"
			- $\cup = \lor$ (in terms of symbols)
		- Next image does it in the opposite direction

		- was only able to prove it because of both directions
		- Steps
			- By assumption
			- Definition of union
			- Definition of complement
			- Definition of negation
			- de Morgan's Law propositional logic
			- Definition of intersection
			- Definition of Complement

		- Can go from "intersection" to "and" symbol using definition of intersection
		- Steps
			- Definition of Complement
			- Definition of not an element of
			- Definition of intersection
			- De Morgan for propositional logic
			- Definition for not an element of 
			- Definition of complement
			- Definition of union

		- When showing complement of union operator, do $\overline A \cup \overline B$ and for intersection, do $\overline {A \cap B}$ w/ single line on top
- Generalized Union and Intersection

	- Different notation dealing with different sets either you're taking union or intersection of.
