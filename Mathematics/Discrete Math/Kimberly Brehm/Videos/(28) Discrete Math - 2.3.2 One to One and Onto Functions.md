- Injective (one-to-one) functions
	- Each value in the range corresponds to exactly one element in the domain
	- It would not be a one-to-one function if D mapped to 3 since C already maps to 3
	- A contrapositive statement is negating the terms of a converse statement
		- A conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive

- Surjective (onto) Functions
	- Every element in the codomain maps to at least one element in the domain.

- Bijective (one-to-one correspondence) Functions
	- Functions that are both one-to-one and onto, or both surjective and injective
	- (my notes)
		- There are no elements in the codomain that aren't mapped to from an element in the domain
		- Only one line (mapping) from each element of the domain
