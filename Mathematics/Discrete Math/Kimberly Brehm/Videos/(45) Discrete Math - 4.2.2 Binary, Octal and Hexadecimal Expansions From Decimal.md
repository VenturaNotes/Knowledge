	- Slide 1
		- Finding an octal expansion
			- Find the octal expansion of $(12543)_10$
		- Dealing essentially with division algorithm: $a = dq + r$
			- a = some value
			- d = divisor
			- q = quotient
			- r = remainder
		- Octal expansion means we're dealing with a `mod 8` number.
		- When dealing with `mod` something, we're very interested in the remainders.
		- For octal values when going from decimal
			- Will use divisor of 8 since dealing with octal
				- `1567` is found by doing `12543 / 8`
				- `7` is found by doing `12543 % 8`
			- Then repeat the process taking the quotient until the quotient is 0.
	- Slide 2
		- Finding a hexadecimal expansion
			- Find the hexadecimal expansion of $(19472)_{10}$
				- A = 10, B = 11, C = 12, D = 13, E = 14, F = 15
	- Slide 3
		- Finding a binary expansion
			- Find the binary expansion of 141.
			- When writing things in binary, keep it in groups of 4.
