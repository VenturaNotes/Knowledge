		-  mod 4 gives you 4 possible remainders: {0, 1, 2, 3}
		- 2 $\equiv$ 6 (mod 4)
			- This is true because you can do 4 | (2-6) = 4 | -4 = -1 (since 4 divides -4, we know that 2 is congruent to 6. The differences in their remainders is divisible by 4)
				- The "|" symbol means to divide by 
		- 24 $\equiv$ 14 (mod 4)
			- This is false because 6 does not divide 10

		- We find that 4|2 = 4(`some number` ) + 2. The `some number` here is 0 because $4(0) + 2 = 2$. This also means that 2 = 2mod 4.
		- Same can be applied for 4|6
		-  24 $\equiv$ 14 (mod 6) is incongruent because the remainder found are not equal between 24 and 14. 
- The integers a and b are congruent modulo m iff there is an integer x such that a=b + km

- Arithmetic modulo m
	- We can define operations on $\mathbb{Z}_m$ the set of non-negative integers less than m, {0, 1, 2, ..., m-1}.
	- Addition (denoted + m): a + $_m$ b = (a + b) mod m
	- Multiplication (denoted $*$ m): a $*$ $_m$ b = (a $*$ b) mod m
