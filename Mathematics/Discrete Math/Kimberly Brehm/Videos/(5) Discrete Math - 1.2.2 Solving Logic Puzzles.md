- Solving Logic puzzles
	- Application of propositional logic
- An island has two knights of inhabitants, knights, who always tell the truth, and knaves, who always lie. You go to the island and meet A and B. A says "B is a knight." B says, "The two of us are of opposite types." What are A and B? Let p represent that A is a knight and q represent that B is a knight.

		- Knave: A dishonest or unscrupulous man
		- Modified truth table?
		- $p \land \lnot q$ is faulty logic. Knight is lying
	- Truth Table

		-  T/F values for possibilities of p are put in. 
			- A says "B" is a knight. q is put in "B says the two are of opposite types"
		- Knight = T and Knave = F
- "When planning a party, you want to know whom to invite. Among the people you would like to invite are three touchy friends. You know that if Jasmine attends, she will become unhappy if Samir is there, Samir will attend only if Kanti will be there, and Kanti will not attend unless Jasmine also does. Which combinations of these three friends can you invite so as not to make someone unhappy?"

		- There are 3 solutions
	- Solving the above problem step by step
		- Propositions
			-  j: Jasmine attends
			- s: Samir attends
			- k: Kanti attends
		- Each of the 3 "groups" are possibilities for each person to be happy. If they all match, all will be happy.
			- If Jasmine attends, she will become unhappy if Samir is there.
				- Therefore, $J \implies \lnot s$ so that Jasmine will be happy.
			- Samir will attend only if Kanti attends.
				- Therefore, $S \implies K$ so Samir will be happy. 
			- Kanti attends only if Jasmine attends.
				- Therefore, $K \implies J$ so Kanti will be happy

		- Implications need to be true for people to be happy
