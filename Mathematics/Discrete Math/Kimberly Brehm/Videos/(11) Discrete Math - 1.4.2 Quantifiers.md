- Quantifiers
	- As we know, a propositional function P(x) is not a proposition until it has truth value. Up to this point, we could only do this by assigning a value to our variable
		- Ex. If P(x) represents "x > 0", find the truth value for P(4).
			- 4 > 0 TRUE
	- Now we will turn a propositional function into a proposition using a quantifier.
	- Let's focus on the two most widely used quantifiers
		- "For all" $\forall$
			- Universal Quantifier
			- $\forall x P(x)$ 
				- For every x, P(x) is True
		- "There Exists" $\exists$ 
			- Existential Quantifier
			- $\exists x P(x)$
				- There exists some x, such that P(x) is True
- The universal quantifier "$\forall$"
	- The statement, $\forall x P(x)$ tells us that the proposition P(x) must be true for all values of x in the domain of discourse/universe
	- Example
		- Let P(x) represent "x > 0". Find each truth value for $\forall x P(x)$ 
			- U is $\mathbb{Z}$  - Integers
				- -3 $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$ ?
					- -3 > 0 False (counterexample)
			- U is $\mathbb{Z}^+$ - Positive integers 
				- TRUE

			- The set of all x
			- x is an element of the set of real numbers
			- but x is not 17
- The existential quantifier $\exists$ 
	- The statement, $\exists x P(x)$, tells us that the proposition P(x) is true for some value(s) of x in the domain of discourse/universe
	- Example
		- Let P(x) represent "x > 0". Find each truth value for $\exists x P(x)$
			- U is $\mathbb{Z}$
				- 7 $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$
					- 7 > 0
						- True
			- U is $\mathbb{Z}^-$ 
				- False
- The Quantifiers
	- Universal
		- $\forall$ 
		- "For all"
		- When True?
			- When P(x) is true for every x in the domain
		- When false?
			- Thee is an x in the domain for which P(x) is false
		- $\forall x P(x) \equiv P(x_1) \land P(x_2) \land ... \land P(x_n)$ 
	- Existential
		- $\exists$
		- "There exists"
		- When true?
			- Three is an x in the domain for which P(x) is true
		- When false?
			- When p(x) is false for every x in the domain
		- $\exists x P(x) \equiv P(x_1) \lor P(x_2) \lor ... \lor P(x_n)$
- Practice

		- If you find a counter-example, thew hole statement is false
		- By cycling through values, you can test the truth table
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-17 at 6.58.48 PM.png]]
		- Good to give counterexample when saying false
- The uniqueness Quantifier $\exists !$ 
	- The statement, $\exists ! x P(x)$, tells us that the proposition P(x) is true for exactly one value of x in the domain of discourse/universe.
	- Give the truth value for $\exists ! x P(x)$ for each proposition in the domain of all integers
		- P(x) represents "2x = 4"
			- x = 2
				- TRUE
		- P(x) represents "2x > 4"
			- x > 2
				- FALSE since x = 3,4
		- P(x) represents "2x = 3
			- x = 1.5
				- FALSE because not a unique `integer`
	- My notes
		- E! means there exists exactly 1. Exists solution and it is unique
