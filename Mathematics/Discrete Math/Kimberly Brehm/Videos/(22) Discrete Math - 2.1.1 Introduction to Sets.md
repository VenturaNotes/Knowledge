- Set Vocabulary and Notation
	- Set
		- Unordered collection of objects
		- B = {Eric, Adam, Kevin}
	- Elements
		- An object in set
			- Adam $\in B$ 
			- Larry $\notin$ B
	- $\in and \notin$ 
		- Contained in or an element in. $\in$ or $\notin$ 
- Sets you should know
	- $\mathbb{N}$ - Natural
		- Counting #'s
		- {1, 2, 3, ...}
	- $\mathbb{W}$ - Whole
		- 0, $\mathbb{N}$ 
		- {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
	- $\mathbb{Z}$ - Integers
		- $\pm \mathbb{W}$ 
		- {... -2, -1, 0, 1, 2 ...}
		- $\mathbb{Z}^+$ are positive integers
		- $\mathbb{Z}^-$ are negative integers
	- $\mathbb{Q}$ - Rational
		- $\frac ab, a,b \in \mathbb{Z}, b\not= 0, \frac ab \text{is in lowest terms}$
	- $\mathbb{R}$ - Real
		- Includes all the sets above
	- $\mathbb{C}$ - Complex
		- a + bi
		- a is a real # but bi represents imaginary portion of that #

		- Just listing elements in sets.
	- Set-Builder Notation

		- Can be used for continuous or discrete
		- S= {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
			- Set S is all elements x such that x is an element of the natural numbers and also that x <= 5.
	- Interval Notation

		- is what we're going to do with continuous sets
		- is the best/clearest/easiest
		- implies that it's continuous.
