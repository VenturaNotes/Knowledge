- Modular arithmetic deals with bases of numbers. Mod 3 addition is base 3
- Let $b \in \mathbb{Z}$ and $b>1$ . Then if $n \in Z^+$, it can be expressed uniquely in the form $$n = a_kb^k + a_{k-1}b^{k-1} + ... + a_1b + a_0$$ where k is a non-negative integer, $a_0$, $a_1$ ... $a_k$ are non-negative integers less than b, and $a_k \ne 0$. Write the $\underset {\text{base 10}} {\underline{\text{decimal expansion}}}$ of 10,456.
