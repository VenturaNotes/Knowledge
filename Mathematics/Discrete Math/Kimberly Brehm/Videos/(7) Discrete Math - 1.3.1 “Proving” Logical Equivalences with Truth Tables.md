- No mathematical proof, just equivalence

	- Some terminology
		- Tautology
			- A proposition which is always true(yellow highlight)
			- Example
				- $p \lor \lnot p$ 
		- Contradiction
			- A proposition which is always false. (blue highlight)
			- Example
				- $p \land \lnot p$ 
		- Contingency
			- A proposition which is neither a tautology nor a contradiction. (purple highlight)
			- Example
				- p
	- We would take $2^n$ (where n is the # of propositions), to find the number of rows.
- Logical Equivalences
	- Two compound propositions p and q are logically equivalent if $p \iff q$ is a tautology, meaning they have the same truth value in all possible cases.
	- We write this as $p \equiv q$ where p and q are compound propositions.
	- Let's use this truth table to show that $\lnot p \land q \equiv p\implies q$

		- The compound proposition in this case is that p is $\lnot p$ and q is $p\implies q$. The p and q variables are substitutions for actual compound proposition.
		- The compound proposition p is not the same p as $\lnot p \lor q$

		- We have shown by a truth table that they are logically equivalent
