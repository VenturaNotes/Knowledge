		- Write the result and then the reason why
		- Steps
			- 2nd De Morgan Law
			- 1st De Morgan Law
			- Double Negation Law
			- 2nd Distributive Law
			- 2nd Negation Law
			- Commutative Law for Disjunction
			- Identity Law
		- You don't really need to specify which # of the negation law (Ayushe)
- Example

		- Whatever steps you go through, it must be equivalent to true
		- You should specify 1st or 2nd De Morgan Laws but you don't need to specify negation law
- Practice
	- Use Logical equivalence to show:
