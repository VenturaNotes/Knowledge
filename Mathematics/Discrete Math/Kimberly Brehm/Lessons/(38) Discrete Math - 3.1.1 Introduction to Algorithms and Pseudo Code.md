- Algorithms
	- The specified steps of a procedure that takes a valid input and produces the desired output.
	- Example - Describe an algorithm for finding the maximum value in a finite sequence of integers
		- 1) Set the first value equal to our temp max
		- 2) Compare the $2^{nd}$ integer to our temp max. If the integer is greater than our temp max, set it as our new temp max. Otherwise ignore.
		- 3) Repeat until no more integers exist
		- 4) When algorithm terminates, the temp max is the max integer
- Pseudocode
	- An intermediate language between English and a programming language like C++ or Java

- More on pseudocode (Appendix 3)
	- procedure algorithm name (list description of input variables)
	- {comments}
	- variable:= expression
	- if condition then statement or block of statements
	- if condition then statement 1
	- else statement 2 or
	- else if condition 2 then statement 2
	- else if condition 3 the statement 3 ...
- More on pseudocode
	- For variable := initial value to final value statement or block of statements
	- for 
		- elements with a certain property statement
	- while  
		- condition statement or block of statements
	- return
		- output of algorithm
- Types of Algorithm Problems
	- 1) Searching Problems
		- Looking through list that meets a specific characteristic
	- 2) Sorting Problems
		- sort things from greatest to least or least to greatest
	- 3) Optimization Problems
		- look for the least or greatest. Trying to optimize by maximizing profit or minimizing cost
