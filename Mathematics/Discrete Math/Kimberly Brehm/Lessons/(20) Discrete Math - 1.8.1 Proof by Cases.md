- Methods of proof
	- Proof by cases (Exhaustion)
- Proof by cases
	- In a proof by cases, we must cover all possible cases that arise and cover all of the domain

		- 0 is not considered even or odd
		- For mathematicians the answer is easy: [[Zero|zero]] is an even number. [^1]

		- Without loss of generality
		- WLOG: Going to assume something is true and it's not going to affect outcome
		- WLOG, I would assume x is odd.Just going to show case 1 and case 2

		- If x and y are integers and both $x*y$ and $x+y$ are even, then both x and y are even. This was a proof by contradiction and contraposition.
