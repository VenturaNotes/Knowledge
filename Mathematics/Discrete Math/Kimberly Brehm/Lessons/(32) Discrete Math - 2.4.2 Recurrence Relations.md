- Recurrence Relation
	- An equation that expresses $a_n$ in terms of one or more of the previous terms of the sequence. Initial conditions are required to specify terms that precede the first term where the relation takes effect.

- Solving Recurrence Relations
	- Finding a non-recursive formula to calculate $a_n$ is called solving the recurrence relation. The solution is called a closed formula.
	- One method for solving is called iteration, involving substitution.
