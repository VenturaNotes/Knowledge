- Sorting Algorithms
	- An algorithm that sorts the elements of a list into increasing order (numerical, alphabetical, etc.)
		- Used often for large data bases like sorting customer or part numbers, prices, etc.
		- Phone directories
		- Over 100 sorting algorithms have been devised.
- Bubble sort
	- A simple algorithm that successively compares adjacent elements, interchanging them if they are in the wrong order. This may require several passes.

- Insertion Sort
	- Another simple sorting algorithm that begins with the second element, comparing it to the first and ordering it appropriately. The third element is then compared with the first and, if necessary, the second to order it. This pattern repeats.
