- Searching problems
	- The goal is to locate an element x in the list of distinct elements or determine that it is not in the list.
	- The solution is the location of the term that equals x or 0 is x is not in the list
	- Example
		- spell check
- Linear Search

- Binary Search
	- In a list of items in increasing order, the binary search algorithm begins by comparing the desired element x with the middle value.
	- The algorithm then chooses the upper or lower half of the data by comparing the desired value with the middle value. the process continues until a list of size 1 is found
