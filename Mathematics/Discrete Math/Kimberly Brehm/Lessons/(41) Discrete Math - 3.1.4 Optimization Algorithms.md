- Greedy Algorithms
	- These algorithms makes the "best" choice at each step. We must specify what that "best" choice is.
		- Finding shortest path between two points
		- Connect network using least amount of fiber-optic cable
		- Scheduling
- Design a greedy algorithm for making change of n U.S. cents with quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies

- We have several proposed courses to schedule in the MathX lab with start and end times given. No two courses can meet at the same time, but one can start when another ends. How do we make the best choice to schedule as many classes as possible?
