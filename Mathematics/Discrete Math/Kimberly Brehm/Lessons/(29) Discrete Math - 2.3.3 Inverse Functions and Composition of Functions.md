- Inverse functions
	- let f be a bijection (both one-to-one and onto) from set A to B. The inverse of f, $f^{-1}$, is the function from B to A defined as $f^{-1}(y)=x$ iff $f(x) = y$

		- Because it is both one-to-one and onto it is a bijection and therefore invertible
		- Inverse just has to undo whatever our original function is
- Composition of Functions
	- Let f: A $\rightarrow$ B and g: B $\rightarrow$ C. The composition of g with f, g$\circ$f, is the function from A to C defined by g$\circ$f(x) = g(f(x))
