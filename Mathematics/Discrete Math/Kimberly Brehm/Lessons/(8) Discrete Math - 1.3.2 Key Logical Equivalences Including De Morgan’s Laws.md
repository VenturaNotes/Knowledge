			- First equivalence above is a tautology because it's always true
			- Second equivalence above is a contradiction because it's always false

		- The left are conditional statements and the right are biconditional statements
		- If you use these in a logical equivalence proof, you're just going to have to write out what the law says as opposed to writing the name of the law which is what we'll do for any of the ones on the previous slides
