	- The [[Binomial Theorem]]
		- Used to help solve complex binomials in a quick manner
		- The formula: If n $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}^+$ (positive integers), then
			- $(x+y)^n = \Sigma_{k=0}^n$$n \choose k$$x^{n-k}y^k$ 
				- where $n \choose k$ is called the [[binomial coefficient]]
				- Can be proven with mathematical induction (we will cover this topic later on)
	- n choose k is a combination
	- Basic Example: Consider $(x + y)^2$ and expand it using normal methods, then using the binomial theorem
		- When doing n choose n, it will always equal 1
	- Practice
		- Expand $(a + b)^6$ using the binomial theorem
		- Will learn [[pascal's triangle]] which will show why the coefficients are symmetrical
