	- Introduction to [[propositional logic]]
		- [[Proposition]]: A declarative sentence that is either true or false (but not both)
		- Examples:
			- 2 is less than 4
			- 7 is greater than 9
			- The world is centered around me
		- Non-examples
			- Do your homework (These commands are called imperatives)
	- Syntax:
		- Propositions are denoted with capital letters: P, Q, and R
			- P = I eat McDonalds every night for a month
			- Q = I will exercise
		- Lowercase letters p, q, and r, ... are used for general propositions that have no meaning (almost like variables)
			- These are what we use for general proofs
	- [[Connectives]]
		- Connectives are used for making compound propositions.  [^1]
			- Negation, Conjunction, Disjunction, Exclusive Or, Implication, Biconditional 
	- Practice: Interpret the following and translate the statement into English
		- P = I eat McDonalds every night for a month
		- Q = I exercise
		- R = I will be obese
		- S = I will go to the hospital
	- Practice 2: Translate the following sentence into propositional logic
