	- Proofs using [[truth table|truth tables]]
		- Review of truth tables
			- All [[Proposition|propositions]] have a truth value and the truth value of a compound proposition depends on the values of its components
				- [[Connectives]] take one or more truth values and output another truth value
			- Truth tables are used to show all possible combinations of statements and connectives along with their truth values
	- Proofs Using Truth Values
		- Formulas p and q are logically equivalent if and only if the truth conditions of p are the same as the truth conditions of q
			- This means that the truth values must be equivalent in all cases
		- [[Tautology]]: A logical statement that is always true
		- [[Contradiction]]: A logical statement that is always false
	- Practice
		- (1) Show that
			- [[logically equivalent]] ($\equiv$)
			- Proved [[De Morgan's law]]
		- (2) Show that
		- Note: Those two laws we just proved are called DeMorgan's Laws
		- (3) Determine if it's a [[tautology]] ()
