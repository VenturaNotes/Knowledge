	- [[Proof by contradiction]]: We assume the logical negation of the result we want to prove; then reach some kind of contradiction
		- Often used to prove the impossibility of something, you assume it is possible then reach a contradiction
	- (1) Prove the following:
		- Show that $\sqrt{2}$ is [[irrational]]
	- (2) Prove: 
		- If 3n + 2 is an odd integer, then n is odd
		- Contradiction should be a third option. Second option should be contraposition (as shown in second example)
