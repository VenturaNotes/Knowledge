	- [[Set-builder notation|Set Builder Notation]]
		- We can create rules and use variables when describing and building a set
		- This can allow our sets to be more flexible, and more easily understood
	- Example:
		- Consider the set for [[rational numbers]]
	- Practice:
		- Example 1: Consider creating a set for things on your bedside table, write the set with builder notation
			- Bedside table = {Alarm clock, phone, wallet}
		- Example 2: Create a subset containing the positive odd integers using set builder notation
