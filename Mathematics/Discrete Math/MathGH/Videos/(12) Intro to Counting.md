	- Introduction to [[Counting]]
		- Often labeled the most difficult part of [[discrete math]]
		- Using formulas is not enough, you must really think about what the question is asking and then be creative to determine how to use/modify a formula for that unique situation
	- [[Principle of Addition]] (Sum Rule of Counting)
		- For two separate tasks, if task A can be done n ways and task B can be done m ways, then A and B can be done in n + m ways.
		- Example 1: How many different ways can you draw a jack or an ace in a standard deck of cards?
	- [[Product Principle]] (Product Rule of Counting)
		- In a list, A through B, if there are n ways of choosing A, and m ways of choosing B, then there are n$*$m ways of choosing AB
		- Example 2: How many different ways can I customize my phone?
			- Assume there are 6 different storage options, 8 different colors, and 2 different firmware's I can choose from.

	- Practice
		- (1) How many different ways can I roll a 2 or a 4?
			- {1 ,2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
				- 2 ways
				- Using principle of addition
		- (2) How many different ways can I customize a license plate that has 5 letters, then 2 numbers
			- Using product principle
