	- [[Proof by contraposition]]
		- (1) Proof by contraposition: We are trying to prove if p, then q. We can do this with contraposition by proving not q implies not p
			- Remember that contrapositive truth values are equivalent to the truth values of the original statement
		- When doing proofs this way, we start off by assuming the opposite of our conclusion is true, we then use that to show that our hypothesis statement must be false as well.
	- Example 1
		- Prove the following
			- Let x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$
			- If $x^2 - 6x + 5$ is even, then x is odd
		- If k is an integer and you square, subtract or add  another integer, it's still going to be an integer
		- If $\lnot a \to \lnot p$, then $p \to a$ based on [[logical equivalence]]
	- Example 2
		- Prove the following
			- Let x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$
			- Then $x^2$ is even, if and only if x is even
		- Need to show both sides
