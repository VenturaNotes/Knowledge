	- Review of [[Set operations]]
		- Each and every [[subset]] A is in a [[universe]] U
			- A $\subseteq$ U
		- [[Complement]] of A: Everything in the universe that is not in A (Notated by $A^C$ or $\overline A)$
			- $A^{C}$ = U - A = {x|x $\notin$ A}
		- [[Intersection]] of A and B: A $\cap$ B is the intersection of A and B
			- A $\cap$ B = {x|x $\in$ A and x $\in$ B}
		- [[Union]] of A and B: A $\cup$ B is the union of A and B
			- $A \cup B$ = {x|x $\in$ A or x $\in$ B}
		- [[Difference]] of A and B: A - B is the difference of A and B
			- A - B = {x| x $\in$ A and x $\notin$ B}
