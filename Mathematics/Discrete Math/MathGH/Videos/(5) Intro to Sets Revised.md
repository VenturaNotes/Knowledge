	- Introduction to [[Set|sets]]
		- A set is a collection of unordered, distinct objects (could be numbers, could be something else) that we call elements
		- There are multiple ways to represent sets in mathematics
	- Important points
		- There is no order in a set: {0, 1, 5} = {1, 5, 0}
		- Repeated elements are listed once in a set: {0, 0, 0, 1, 5, 5} = {0, 1, 5}
		- Sets can be [[finite]] or [[infinite]]
			- A = {0, 1, 5}
				- Finite means countable
			- $\mathbb{Z}$ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
				- The dotted lines implies a repeated pattern
				- [[Set of integers]]
					- $\mathbb{Z}$
	- Important Sets
		- (1) [[Natural numbers]]: Set of positive integers (sometimes includes 0)
			- $\mathbb{N}$ = {1, 2, 3, 4, ...}
			- Same thing as "counting numbers"
		- (2) [[Integers]]: Includes all positive and negative integers
			- $\mathbb{Z}$ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
		- (3) [[Rational Numbers]]: Include any number you can write as a fraction
			- $\mathbb{Q}$ 
	- Elements and Cardinality
		- Symbol for [[inclusion]] is $\in$ (Epsilon)
			- For [[exclusion]], simply put a dash through the epsilon
		- [[Cardinality]]: The size of a set (number of elements)
			- Notated by straight lines on both sides
	- Example: Let B = {Square, Rectangle, Pentagon}
