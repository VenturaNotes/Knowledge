	- Practice with [[Subset|subsets]] and [[Power Set|power sets]]
		- [[Subset|subsets]]
			- B is a subset of A if every element in B is also in A
				- We write this as B $\subseteq$ A
				- If B is not a subset of A, we put the dash through the subset symbol
				- The [[empty set]] is a subset of any and all sets <- Commonly Tested!
		- [[Power Set|power sets]]
			- The set of all possible subsets
				- Notated by P(A)
			- To determine the power set by hand, you can use the tree method
				- Begin with the empty set then move down one element at a time, either adding the element, or keeping the element out of your set
				- After doing this for all elements, the bottom row will be your power set
			- To determine [[Cardinality]] of power set
				- If |A| = n, then |P(A)| = $2^n$
				- Reasoning behind this, each element can be in a subset, or not(so, you have two options for each of the n elements)
	- Practice
		- (1) Find the power set of set A where A = {1, 2, 3}
		- (2) Let A = {1, {1}, {2}}. Determine which of the following is true
			- T
			- F
			- T
			- For 1 $\subseteq$ A, this is false because 1 is not a set
			- T
			- F
			- T
