	- Rule of Sum and Product Practice
		- [[Principle of Addition]] (Sum Rule of Counting)
			- For two separate tasks, if task A can be done n ways and task B can be done m ways then A and B can be done in n + m ways
		- [[Product Principle]] (Product Rule of Counting)
			- In a list, A through B, if there are n ways of choosing A, and m ways of choosing B, then there are $n*m$ ways of choosing AB
	- (1) How many ways can I customize a license plate that contains 2 odd numbers, 2 vowels, and 3 numbers? (Assuming they have to be in this order)
	- (2) Assume there are 7 men and 8 women in a race. How many different ways could we choose first place and a male second place finisher?
	- (3) Question
		- I am buying an ice cream cone and have the following options
			- a. Three different cone types
			- b. Eight different flavors
			- c. Four different sizes
		- Q1: How many ways can I make a cone if I do not mix flavors (only 1 flavor)?
		- Q2: How many different ways can i order a cone if I choose to mix three flavors?
			- Note: For Q2 we are assuming that order does matter: so a cone with strawberry at the top, chocolate in the middle, and vanilla at the bottom is different than one with vanilla at the top, chocolate in the middle, and strawberry at the bottom!
			- We are also assuming no flavor can be chosen twice
