- Strings
	- Let A be any set
		- Definition $A^n = \{\langle a_1,...,a_n\rangle : a_i \in A\}$ the set of n-tuple of elements from A.
			- $<a_1,..., a_n >$ is known as an [[n-tuple]]
				- It has n elements from A (one after each other)
		- $\langle \rangle$ is the empty string
	- $A^{<\omega}$ is read as "A to the less than omega" to denote the set of all strings
