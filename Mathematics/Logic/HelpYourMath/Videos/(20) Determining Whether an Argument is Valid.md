- Turning sentences into symbols
	- If the sentence is written as a simple or compound statement, then assign a variable to each simple statement
	- If the sentences uses a universal quantifier, rewrite it as a conditional statement
		- We don't have a thing for $\forall$ in logic
	- For example: "all squares have four sides" using symbols
		- First, we need to write the statements in logic form. This type of sentence is a conditional sentence:
		- If a shape is a square, then it has four sides
		- Now we assign variables. You can either stick with p and q or use letters that are appropriate for the situation
			- Let S = A shape is a square
			- Let F = A shape has four sides
		- Then "all squares have four sides" becomes s $\rightarrow$ f

- Some helpful steps for determining the validity of an argument
	- (1) Identify all statements
		- These should not have negations (not or no)
		- Label them appropriately
			- If today is cloudy, might represent that with "c"
	- (2) Rewrite each premise and the conclusion in symbols in a similar set up to an addition problem.
	- (3) Set up a truth table including all necessary statements
	- (4) Determine if the argument is valid (we'd need a tautology at the end)

- Tell whether each argument is valid (<mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">valid</mark>)
	- If it rains, then I will watch The Simpsons marathon. I did not watch The Simpsons. Therefore, it did not rain.
		- Step 1: Identify (and label) the simple statements
		- Step 2: Write arguments in symbols
		- Step 3: Write the argument as a conditional statement

	- Either I did not study or I passed the exam. I did not study. Therefore, I did not pass the exam.

	- Every time I hit the snooze button, I get 10 more minutes of sleep. I get 10 more minutes of sleep or I miss the buss. I missed the bus. Therefore, I hit the snooze button.
