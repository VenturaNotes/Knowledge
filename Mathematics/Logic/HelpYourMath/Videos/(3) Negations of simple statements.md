- Negations
	- The negation of a statement is a corresponding statement with the opposite truth value. (that is, both statements cannot be true.)
		- Example: The negation of: "I like the Red Sox" would be "I don't not like the Red Sox."
			- You cannot say "I hate the Red Sox" as the negation because then there creates a middle ground of "ambivalence". You can hate something, you can like something, and you can be indifferent about something. 
			- Saying I like vs do not like makes it so only 2 choices are possible (binary)
		- Another example: The negation of: "My shirt is not striped" would be "My shirt is striped."
	- These are considered simple negations

- Write the negation of each statement
	- New York City is the cleanest city in the world
		- New York City is not the cleanest city in the world.
	- Holy Grail is one of Jay Z's albums
		- Holy Grail is not one of Jay Z's albums.
	- I do not like green eggs and ham
		- I like green eggs and ham (or I do like green eggs and ham.)

- Special Cases
	- Usually inserting or removing the word "Not" makes the negation of the statement. In some cases, we do not
		- The negation of "X is a number less than 12" would be "X is a number greater than or equal to 12."
		- The negation of "F > -5" would be "F $\le$ -5"
