- Determining the validity of an argument using truth tables
	- Step 1: Write the argument as a conditional statement
	- Step 2: Set up a truth table similar to the following
		- Columns for simple statements and premises
		- Premise $\land$ Premise $\implies$ Conclusion
	- Step 3: If all truth values under $\rightarrow$ are T's (trues) (i.e. a tautology), then the argument is valid; otherwise it is invalid.

- More about step 1:
	- Use a conjunction between the premises and the implication for the conclusion.
	- Notation: Implication is $\implies$ (It's the same as $\rightarrow$ but will only be used for to separate the premises from the conclusion)
		- Seems like "$\rightarrow$" is used for conditionals while "$\implies$" is used for implication
	- Notation: Using symbols, "therefore" is $\therefore$

- Since we have a single false in the implication at the right-most part of the table, the argument is no good and we would need to fill in the rest of the table. <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">invalid</mark>
