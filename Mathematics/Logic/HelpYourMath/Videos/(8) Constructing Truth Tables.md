- Truth Tables
	- To construct a truth table, we create columns for each simple statement and negation needed, add to it compound statements, and then the complete statement.
		- We consider truth values for each simple statement and base the truth values of negations and compound statements from these.

- Constructing a Truth Table
	- Let's look at Dr. L's suggested steps
		- (1) Decide how many rows you need
			- $2^n$ where n is the number of simple statements
				- If you have 3 simple statements, you'd need 8 rows
				- If you have 2 simple statements, you'd need 4 rows
		- (2) Fill in the simple statements!
		- (3) Create a column for any negation needed.
		- (4) Fill in any compound statements
		- (5) Lastly, fill in the truth value for the given statement.

	- Another example!
		- Construct a truth table
		- Pre-plan! What statements are we considering here?
		- How many rows do I need?
			- $2^3 = 8$
		- How many columns do I need?
			- 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 6
