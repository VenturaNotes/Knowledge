	- If you fall asleep in class, I would be very sad.
	- Someone who has at least $1,000,000 is a millionaire

- Rewriting statements into conditional statement form
	- We could rewrite the last statement in if..., then form
		- Every integer that is a factor of 4 is also a factor of 8
			- If an integer is a factor of 4, then it is a factor of 8
		- No sociopath is normal (2 correct answers)
			- If you're a sociopath, then you're not normal
			- If you are normal, you're not a sociopath

- Parts of a conditional statement
	- The statement following the "IF" is called the [[hypothesis]] or [[antecedent]]
	- The statement following the "THEN" is called the [[conclusion]] or [[consequent]]
	- A statement is basically a promise that if p occurs then q will too. The conditional statement is true unless a true hypothesis leads to a false conclusion

- Conditional Statements
	- The use of the conditional connective does not necessarily imply a cause-and-effect relationship, although they make much more sense when they do!
	- For example: If I buy a house, then the sun will rise in the east.
