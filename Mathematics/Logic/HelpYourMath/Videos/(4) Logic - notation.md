- Notations
	- Simple statements are usually denoted with single lowercase letters, traditionally p and q. (Next would be "r")
		- Simple statements do not have negations in them
			- If there was a sentence such as "I do not like coffee", the simple sentence would be "I like coffee."
- Let p be the statement: I get paid Friday
- Let q be the statement: I will go dancing this weekend

- Notation time!
	- Naturally, all the connectors have logic symbols associated with them:
	- Connective, Symbol, Name
		- And, $\land$, Conjunction
		- Or, $\lor$, Disjunction
		- Not, ~, Negation
		- If...then, $\implies$, conditional
		- ... if and only if... $\iff$ biconditional

- Notation in Action!
- If p is the statement: I get paid Friday and q is the statement: I will go dancing this weekend, then:
	- $\lnot$p: I do not get paid Friday
	- $p \lor q$: I get paid Friday or I will go dancing this weekend
	- $p \land q$: I get paid Friday and I will go dancing this weekend
	- $p \implies q$: I get paid Friday, then I will go dancing this weekend
	- $q \implies p$: If I go dancing this weekend, then I get paid Friday.
	- $p \iff q$: I get paid Friday iff I go dancing this weekend
