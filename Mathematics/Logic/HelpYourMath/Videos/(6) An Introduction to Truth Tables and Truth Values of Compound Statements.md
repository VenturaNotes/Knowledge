	- A [[truth table]] is a table in which we consider all the possible combinations of truth values for two or more statements
	- A truth value of a statement is True or False
	- Sometimes we are told the truth value of the statement, sometimes we have to make the determination, and sometimes we have to create a table to consider all truth values of the simple statements.

- [[Conjunction|Conjunctions]]
	- Recall a conjunction of two statements implies both or all statements must be true.
	- In symbols: $p \land q$ 
	- A truth table would look like this

- Finding the Truth value of a conjunction
	- Let p represent "The earth is round." and let q represent "The earth rotates around the su." Find the truth value of $p \land q$
		- I'm surprised the word "rotates" is being used. Shouldn't it be "revolves"? My 8th grade middle school teacher suggested that.

	- Recall a disjunction of two statements implies at least one of the statements must be true.
	- In symbols: $p \lor q$

	- Recall a negation of a statement is a statement with opposite truth value
	- In symbols: $\textasciitilde p$
	- A truth table would look like this
