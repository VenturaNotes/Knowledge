- Variations of the conditional statement
	- A conditional statement is of the form:
		- If p, then q or p $\implies$ q
	- p is called the hypothesis or the antecedent
	- q is called the conclusion or the consequent
	- Three other related statements can also be formed
		- The [[Converse|converse]]
		- The [[inverse]]
		- The [[Contrapositive]]

- He said/she said
	- Abbylou tells her boyfriend: If you cheat on me, then I'm leaving you. (True)
	- What is the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of this statement? Also think about the truth value of each statement, assuming Abbylou is telling the truth
		- Converse: If I leave you, then you cheated on me
			- not necessarily true
		- Inverse: If you do not cheat on me, then I will not leave you
			- not necessarily true
		- Contrapositive: If I did not leave you, then you did not cheat on me 
			- True!

- Another example
	- What is the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of this statement? Also think about whether they are true or false. "If I study, then I will pass."
		- Converse: If I passed, then I studied. (not necessarily true)
		- Inverse: If I do not study, then I will not pass (not necessarily true)
		- Contrapositive: If I did not pass, then I did not study (true)

- State the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of the statement "If it rains, then it pours"
	- Converse: If it pours, then it is raining (not necessarily true)
	- Inverse: If it is not raining, then it is not pouring (not necessarily true)
	- Contrapositive: If it is not pouring, then it is not raining (true)
- Contrapositive is always true if the conditional statement is true

- Logically equivalent statements
	- Create a massive truth table to determine which of the 4 statements are logically equivalent
- Logically equivalent means to have the same truth value in every single row in a truth table.
- Converse and inverse are logically equivalent
- Conditional and contrapositive are logically equivalent
---
- Summary
	- A conditional statement is logically equivalent to its contrapositive since they always have the same truth values
	- The converse and inverse are logically equivalent as well ^b02eaf
