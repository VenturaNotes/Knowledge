	- Interpretations of [[probability theory]]
		- A narrow view: a branch of math
			- Axioms $\implies$ theorems
	- One of theorems of probability theory is that probabilities can be interpreted as frequencies
		- "Thm:" "Frequency" of event A "is P(A)
			- If I have a fair coin and toss it infinitely many times, then the fraction of heads we'll observe is $\frac 12$. In this sense, the probability of event A can be interpreted as the frequency with which event A will occur in an infinite number of repetitions in the experiment
	- Are probabilities frequencies?
		- P(coin toss yields heads) = 1/2
		- P(the president of ... will be reelected) = 0.7
			- Difficult to view this as frequencies
	- Probabilities are often interpreted as
		- Description of beliefs
		- Betting preferences

	- The role of probability theory
		- A framework for analyzing phenomena with uncertain outcomes
			- Rules for consistent reasoning
			- Used for predictions and decisions
	- The field of statistics's purpose is to complement probability theory by using data to come up with good models
	- From the "Real World", we get data which will be used in "Inference/Statistics" to develop models for "probability theory (analysis)" which will be used for predictions and decisions in the "real world".
