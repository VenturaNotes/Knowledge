	- A coin tossing problem
		- Given that there were 3 heads in 10 tosses, what is the probability that the first two tosses were heads?
			- Event A: the first 2 tosses were heads
			- Event B: 3 out of 10 tosses were heads
		- Assumptions
			- independence
			- P(H) = p
		- Definition of [[Conditional probability|conditional probabilities]] ^6e5c6f
			- $P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$

	- Second solution
	- Conditional probabilities are proportional to unconditional probabilities
		- Conditional probability law (on B) is uniform
