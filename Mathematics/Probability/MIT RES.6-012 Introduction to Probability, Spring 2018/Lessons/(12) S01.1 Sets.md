	- [[set|Sets]]
		- A collection of distinct elements
		- {a, b, c, d}
			- Finite
		- $\mathbb{R}$
			- Infinite set
		- {x $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$ : cos(x) > $\frac 12$}
			- $x \in \mathbb{R}$ gives the set and the part after ":" restricts it
		- $\Omega$: [[Universal set]]
		- [[Complement]]
			- x $\in$ $S^c$ if x $\in$ $\Omega$, x $\notin$ S
		- [[Empty set]]
		- S $\subset$ T
			- S is a subset of T
			- For this course $\subset$ is understood as $\subseteq$ meaning that "S" can equal "T" in this case

	- [[Union|Unions]] and [[Intersection|Intersections]] (also applies to an infinite collection of subsets)
		- Union of 2 sets can contain elements from both
		- Intersection of 2 sets means elements of both
		- $x \in \underset {n}\cup S_n$ iff x $\in$ $S_n$ for some n
