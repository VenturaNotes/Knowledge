	- [[Bayes' rule]]
		- Initial beliefs
			- Have $P(A_i)$, for every i
		- Have $P(B|A_i)$, for every i
		- revised "beliefs," given that B occurred
	- In $P(A_i|B)$, the conditioning event is P(B)
	- [[Total Probability Theorem]]
		- $P(A_i|B) = \frac {P(A_i)P(B|A_i)}{\Sigma_jP(A_j)P(B|A_j)}$

	- Bayes' rule and inference
		- Thomas Bayes, presbyterian minister (c. 1701-1761)
		- "Bayes' theorem," published posthumously
		- Systematic approach for incorporating new evidence
	- [[Bayesian inference]] (allows us to calculate conditional probabilities going in the opposite direction. Allows us to revise different scenarios taking into account new information)
		- initial beliefs $P(A_i)$ on possible causes of an observed event B
		- model of the world under each $A_i: P(B|A_i)$
		- Draw conclusions about causes
