	- [[Counting]]
		- [[Discrete uniform law]]
			- Assume $\Omega$ consists of n equally likely elements
			- Assume A consists of k elements
			- Then: P(A) = $\frac {\text{number of elements of A}}{\text{number of elements of } \Omega} = \frac kn$
		- Basic [[counting principle]]
			- Allows us to break a counting problem into a sequence of simpler counting problems
		- Applications
			- [[Permutation|Permutations]]
			- [[Combination|Combinations]]
			- [[Partition|Partitions]]
			- Number of subsets
			- [[Binomial Probability|Binomial Probabilities]]
				- The probabilities that describe the number of heads in a sequence of independent coin tosses.
