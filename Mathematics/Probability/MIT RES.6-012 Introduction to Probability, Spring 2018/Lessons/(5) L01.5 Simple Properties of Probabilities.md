- Some simple consequences of the axioms
	- Axioms
		- P(A) $\ge$ 0

| Axioms                                             | Consequences         |
| -------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| P(A) $\ge$ 0                                       | P(A) $\le$ 1         |
| P($\Omega$) = 1                                    | P($\varnothing$) = 0 |
| For Disjoint events (use additivity axiom): P(A $\cup$ B) = $P(A) + P(B)$ | P(A) + P($A^C$) = 1  |
|                                                    | P(A$\cup$ B$\cup$ C) = P(A) + P(B) + P(C) and similarly for k disjoint events                     |

	- Consequences of axioms shown
		- Shows how probabilities must be less than or equal to 1
		- Shows why the empty set has a probability of 0

	- Proof of generalization of additivity axiom (from 2 disjoint events to 3 disjoint events)
	- If talking about probability of a set that contains a singular element $P(\{s_1\})$, we could just talk about probability of that particular element $P(s_1)$. This is simpler notation to talk about probability of individual elements (probability of event thats comprised only of a particular element)
	- For 2nd to last blue, we can use additivity property for union of k disjoint sets
