	- Random variables: the idea
		- Numerical quantity that takes random values.
	- Weight is an object whose value is determined once you tell the outcome of the experiment once told which student is picked
	- Weight is function of the outcome of the experiment
	- The box "SQRT" is a function
	- B = $\frac {W}{H^2}$
		- This is the body mass index

	- Random variables: the formalism
		- A [[random variable]] ("r.v.") associates a value (a number) to every possible outcome
		- Mathematically: A function from the sample space $\Omega$ to the real numbers
		- It can take discrete or continuous values
	- Notation: 
		- random variable X
			- Abstract objects. Functions on the sample space. Denoted by uppercase letters
		- numerical value x
			- Lowercase letters to indicate numerical values of the random variables
	- We can have several random variables defined on the same sample space.
	- A function of one or several random variables is also a random variable
		- A function of random variables has numerical values that are determined by the numerical values of the original random variables. Therefore, they are determined by the outcome of the experiment.
	- Example
		- Meaning of X + Y:
			- Random variables takes value x + y, when X takes value x, Y takes value y
			- Random variables will take numerical values once the outcome of the experiment has been obtained. This will cause X + Y to be x + y.
