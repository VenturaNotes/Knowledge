	- [[Conditional independence]]
		- Conditional independence, given C, is defined as independence under the probability law P($\cdot$|C)
	- Conditional independence is defined as ordinary independence but with respect to the conditional probabilities
	- If 2 events have no intersection, they are extremely dependent
		- If A occurred in C, we know that B did not occur in C
	- If we are told that C occurred, are A and B independent?
		- No
