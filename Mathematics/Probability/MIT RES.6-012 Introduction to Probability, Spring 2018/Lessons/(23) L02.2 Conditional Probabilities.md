	- The idea of conditioning
		- Use new information to revise a model
	- P(A|B)
		- What is the probability of A given that B has occurred?

	- Definition of [[conditional probability]]
		- P(A|B) = "probability of A, given that B occurred"
		- Defined only when P(B) > 0
			- If an event B has 0 probability, then conditional probability given B will be left undefined
		- This is a definition. Not a theorem. There is no issue of correctness
