	- Models based on conditional probabilities
		- Used to revise a model when getting additional information
		- Used to build a multi-stage model of a probabilistic experiment
			- Will illustrate this through an example involving the detection of an object up in the sky by a radar
	- [[Miss]]
		- When something <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">is occurring</mark> but <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not detected</mark>
	- [[False alarm]]
		- When something<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> is not occurring</mark> but is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">detected</mark>
	- 0.99 is the conditional probability that the radar will detect the plane given that the plane is already flying up there.
	- There is only a 34\%  probability that there is an airplane given that the radar registers something on the screen
		- Not a great probability
