	- The [[Multinomial Probability|multinomial probabilities]]
		- balls of different colors: i = 1, ..., r
		- probability of picking a ball of color i is $p_i$ 
		- Draw n balls, independently
		- Given nonnegative numbers $n_i$, with $n_1$ + ... +$n_r = n$ 
		- Find: P($n_1$ balls of color 1, $n_2$ balls of color 2, ..., $n_r$ balls of color r)
	- This is the special case where we're dealing with 2 colors

	- Type: (4, 2, 1)
		- Type of the outcome
	- P(Particular sequence of "type" ($n_1, n_2, ...,n_r$)) = $p_{1}^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}... p_r^{n_r}$
		- The probability is that for each color, we have the probability of that color raised to the power of how many times that particular color appears in a sequence
	- Sequence of type ($n_1, n_2, ..., n_r$)
		- partition of {1, ..., n}
		- into subsets of sizes $n_1, n_2, ... n_r$ 
	- The probability of obtaining a sequence of a certain type
