	- Construction of sample space: Description of the possible outcomes of a probabilistic experiment
	- [[Probability axioms]]
		- In a continuous model, any individual point should have a zero probability
		- [[Event]]: A subset of the sample space
			- Probability is assigned to events
				- Will assign probabilities to whole sets (subsets of the sample space)
	- Probabilities will be assigned to subsets (reasonable to say they'll have positive probabilities)
		- P(A) is probability of set A
			- Will say event A has occurred or not
	- Probabilities are always given in a range between 0 and 1
		- 0 probability means something practically can't happen
		- Probability of 1 means we're practically certain an event of interest is going to happen
	- Axioms of probability theory (rules that any probabilistic model should satisfy)
		- [[Nonnegativity]]: P(A) $\ge$ 0
		- [[Normalization]]: P($\Omega$) = 1
			- We have absolute certainty that event $\Omega$ is going to occur
		- [[Finite Additivity]]: to be strengthened later
			- If A $\cap$ B = $\varnothing$, then P(A $\cup$ B) = P(A) + P(B)
				- We can add probabilities of different sets when those two sets are disjoint
			- [[Disjoint sets]]: Their intersection has no elements (meaning their intersection is the empty set)
