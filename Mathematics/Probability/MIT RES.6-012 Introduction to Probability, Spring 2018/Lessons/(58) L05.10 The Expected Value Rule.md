	- Errata
		- For "Averaging over x": last term should be $4*0.4$
	- The [[expected value rule]], for calculating $E[g(X)]$
	-  If you want to calculate the expected value of the square of a random variable, then you're dealing with a situation where the g function is a square function
	- Caution: In general, $E[g(X)]$ $\ne$ $g(E[X])$
		- There are exceptions however
