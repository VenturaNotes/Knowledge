	- A model based on conditional probabilities
		- 3 tosses of a biased coin: P(H) = p, P(T)= 1 -p
	- Multiplication rule
	- Total probability
		- P(1 head)
			- Means only 1 head in outcome
	- Bayes rule: (conditional probability)
	- <mark style="background: #FF5582A6;">In red</mark> 
		- The unconditional probability of heads in the second toss turns out to be the same as the conditional probabilities
