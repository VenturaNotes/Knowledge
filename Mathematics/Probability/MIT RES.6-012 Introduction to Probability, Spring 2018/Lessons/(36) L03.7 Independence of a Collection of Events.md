	- Independence of a collection of events
		- Intuitive "definition": Information on some of the events does not change probabilities related to the remaining events
	- Definition: Events $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n are called independent if: $P(A_i \cap A_J \cap ... \cap A_m) = P(A_i)P(A_j)...P(A_m)$ for any distinct indices $i, j,...,m$
	- [[pairwise independence]]
