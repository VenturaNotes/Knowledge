	- Example
		- Find the probability that:
			- six rolls of a (six-sided) die all give different numbers.
	- Making assumption that all outcomes equally likely
		- Places us in a [[discrete uniform probabilistic model]]
	- According to [[counting principle]], we have $6^6$ possible outcomes
	- [[Permutation]]
		- 6! tells the number of possible ways a die could give different numbers for 6 rolls
