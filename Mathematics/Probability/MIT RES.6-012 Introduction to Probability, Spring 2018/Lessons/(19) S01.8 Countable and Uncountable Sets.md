	- Countable versus uncountable infinite sets
	- Sets that are discrete are countable
	- Sets that are continuous are uncountable
	- [[Countable Set]]
		- Can be put in 1-1 correspondence with positive integers
		- We want the sequence to exhaust the entire set $\Omega$ 
			- We want to be able to arrange all of the elements of $\Omega$ in a sequence 
		- Examples
			- Positive integers
			- Integers
				- Alternate between positive and negative
					- 0, 1, -1, 2, -2...
			- Pairs of positive integers
				- Triples and quadruples work as well
			- Rational numbers q, with 0 < q < 1 
	- [[Uncountable set]]
		- Not countable
		- the interval \[0, 1\]
			- unit interval or an interval with positive length
		- the reals, the plane
		- Unit interval (has a great argument for this)
