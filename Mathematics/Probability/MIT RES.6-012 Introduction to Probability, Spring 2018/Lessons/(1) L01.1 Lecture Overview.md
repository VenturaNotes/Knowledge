	- Slide Information
		- [[Sample space]]
		- [[Probability Laws]]: Assigns probabilities to outcomes or collections of outcomes. Tells us whether an outcome is much more likely than another outcome
			- [[Axioms]]
				- Probabilities must satisfy basic property to be meaningful
				- Probabilities can't be negative
			- Properties that follow from axioms
		- Examples (models with discrete and continuous outcomes)
			- [[Discrete]]
				- conceptually much easier
			- [[Continuous]]
				- Involves more sophisticated concepts (as well as issues that arise)
		- Discussion
			- [[Countable Additivity]]
			- Mathematical subtleties
		- Interpretation of probabilities
	- A [[probabilistic model]] is a quantitative description of a situation, phenomenon, or an experiment whose outcome is uncertain.
		- This needs 2 key steps
			- Describe possible outcomes of experiment (specifying a sample space)
			- Then specify probability law
	- Will talk about role of [[probability theory]] and its relation with the real world
