	- Conditional probabilities share properties of ordinary probabilities
	- Sample space has unit probability even under the conditional model
	- Also finite countable additivity
	- Conditional probabilities are just like ordinary probabilities (satisfying all the axioms)
		- Any formula or theorem that we ever derive for ordinary probabilities will remain true for conditional probabilities as well
