	- Probability calculation: discrete but infinite sample space
	- Sample space: {1, 2, ...} (outcome is an arbitrary positive integer)
	- [[Infinite Geometric Series]] [^1]

	- You could also just do 
		- $\Sigma_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac {1}{2^n}$ = $\frac {\frac 12}{1 - \frac 12}$ = 1
	- When finding P(outcome is even) = P({2, 4, 6, ...})
		- We have used an [[additivity property]] to find P(2) + P(4) + P(6)
			- This property only talks about disjoint unions of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">finitely</mark> many subsets
				- However here, we're talking about the union of infinitely many subsets
		- Introduce an axiom that will allow this kind of calculation ([[Countable Additivity Axiom]])

	- [[Countable additivity axiom]]
		- strengthens the finite additivity axiom
		- If $A_1, A_2, A_3...$ is an infinite [[Sequence]] of [[disjoint]] events, then $P(A_1 \cup A_2 \cup A_3 \cup ...) = P(A_1) + P(A_2) + P(A_3) + ...$

	- Mathematical Subtleties (fortunately they can all be overcome in a rigorous manner. Can just forget about subtle issues for rest of class)
		- Countable Additivity Axiom
	- The elements of a unit square cannot be arranged in a sequence
		- Unit square is said to be an uncountable set
	- Additivity holds only for "[[countable]]" sequences of events
	- The unit square (similarly, the real line, etc.) is not countable (its elements cannot be arranged in a sequence)
	- There are 2 kinds of infinite sets
		- Discrete (informal terminology: countable)
			- Sets whose elements can be arranged in a sequence (like the integers)
		- Uncountable Sets
			- Unit square or real line whose elements cannot be arranged in a sequence
	- [[Measure Theory]]
		- Is area a legitimate probability law? Does it even satisfy countable additivity?
			- Turns out all is well. Area is legitimate
		- This question takes us into deep waters. (has to do with deep subfield of mathematics called measure theory)
		- "Area" is a legitimate probability low on the unit square, as long as we do not try to assign probabilities/areas to "very strange" sets
			- Subsets that are not nice are pathological
