	- Probability Calculation: discrete/finite example
		- Two rolls of a tetrahedral die
	- Let every possible outcome have probability $\frac {1}{16}$
		- Let Z = min(X, Y)
			- Returns minimum value of X and Y
	- For finite sets, the probability of a finite set is the sum of the probabilities of the elements of that set
		- In P(Z = 2) $5 * \frac {1}{16}$
			- 5 elements
			- Each with probability of $\frac {1}{16}$

	- [[Discrete Uniform Law]]
		- Assume $\Omega$ consists of n equally likely elements
			- $\Omega$ is finite
		- Assume A consists of k elements
		- Counting will turn out to be an important skill
	- Probability of A equals "k" elements multiplied by probability $\frac 1n$
