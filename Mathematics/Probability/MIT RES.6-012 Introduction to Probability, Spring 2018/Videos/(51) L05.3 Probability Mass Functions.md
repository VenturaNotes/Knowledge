	- [[Probability mass function]] (PMF) of a discrete r.v. X
		- It is the "probability law" or "probability distribution" of X
		- If we fix some x, then "X = x" is an event
	- $\Sigma_x p_X(x) = 1$
		- The sum of the associated probabilities should always be equal to 1

	- PMF calculation
	- Two rolls of a tetrahedral die
	- Let every possible outcome have probability $\frac {1}{16}$
	- repeat for all z:
		- collect all possible outcomes for which Z is equal to z
		- Add their probabilities
	- Always convenient to provide plot with the answers that we have
