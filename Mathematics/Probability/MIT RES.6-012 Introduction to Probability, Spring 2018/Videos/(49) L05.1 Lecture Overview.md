		- Probability mass functions and expectations
		- [[Random Variable|Random variables]]: the idea and the definition (loosely speaking, a numerical quantity whose value is determined by the outcome of a probabilistic experiment. Weight of a randomly selected student is one example )
			- [[Discrete]]: Take values in finite or countable sets
				- Random variables that take values in finite or countably infinite sets
				- Random variables that take integer values are discrete
		- [[Probability mass function]] (PMF)
			- To any discrete random variable, we will associate a probability mass function, which tells us the likelihood of each possible value of the random variable.

			- [[Bernoulli]]
			- [[Uniform]]
			- [[Binomial]]
			- [[Geometric]]
		- [[Expectation]] (mean) and its properties (it is the weighted average of the values of the random variable, weighted according to their respective probabilities, and has an intuitive interpretation as the average value we expect to see if we repeat the same probabilistic experiment independently a large number of times)
