	- Terms being added are indexed by multiple indices
	- i and j range over all the positive integers
	- We're taking two dimensional grid and arranging the terms associated with that grid in some particular linear order and summing those terms in sequence
		- As long as sum converges to something, then double series will be well defined
			- If sum of sequences is finite, then order of terms doesn't matter. Will be the same finite number
	- The order of summation may matter

	- Add terms of a double sequence over a limited range of indices
	- Could sum over all i's first and then j's
		- Could sum over all j's first and then i's
	- Should give us the same answer as long as the sum of the absolute values of the terms we're trying to add is < $\infty$
