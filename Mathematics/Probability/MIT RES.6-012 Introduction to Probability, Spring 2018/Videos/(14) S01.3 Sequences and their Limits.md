	- Mathematical Background: Sequences and their limits
	- [[Sequence]]: Some collection of elements coming out of some set
		- Can be represented as
			- sequence $a_i$
			- {$a_i$}
		- These are indexed by the natural numbers
		- It's a function such that to any natural number, associates an element of S
	- [[Converging Sequences]]
		- $\lim_{i \to \infty} a_i =a$
		- For any [[epsilon]] ($\varepsilon > 0$), there exists a time ($i_0$), such that after the time if ($i$ $\ge$ $i_0$), then the element of the sequence is within epsilon of a ($|a_i - a| < \varepsilon$)
			- No matter what kind of bounds I take around my limit a, eventually the sequence will be inside the bound and stay inside there
	- If $a_i$ converges to a, then the sequence $a_i^2$ will converge to $a^2$ 
		- This is true if g is a continuous function which means $g(a_i) \to g(a)$
