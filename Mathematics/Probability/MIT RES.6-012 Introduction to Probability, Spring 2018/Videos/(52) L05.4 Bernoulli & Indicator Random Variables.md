	- The simplest random variable: [[Bernoulli]] with parameter $p \in [0, 1]$
		- It's a random variable that takes the values of 0 or 1, with certain probabilities. Such a random variable is called a [[Bernoulli Random Variable| Bernoulli random variable]].
	- Using PMF notation for this problem
	- Models a trial that results in success/failure, Heads/Tails, etc.
	- Indicator r.v. of an event A: $I_A$ = 1 iff A occurs
	- [[Indicator random variables]]
		- Useful because they allow us to translate a manipulation of events to a manipulation of random variables
			- Sometimes algebra of working with random variables is easier than working with events.
