	- [[Discrete uniform random variable]]; parameters a, b
		- Parameters: integers a, b; a $\le$ b
			- Beginning and end of range of that random variable
		- Experiment: Pick one of a, a+1, ..., b at random; all equally likely
		- Sample space: {a, a+1, ..., b}
			- b-a + 1 are possible values
		- Random variable X: X(w) = w 
		- Model of: complete ignorance
	- Special case: a = b (means random variable can only take one value)
		- Constant/deterministic random variable (r.v.)
			- Mathematically, we can still consider it a random variable that just happens to be the same no matter what the outcome of the experiment is.
