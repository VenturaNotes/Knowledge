	- When does a [[Converging Sequences|sequence converge]]?
		- If $a_i \le a_i + 1$, for all i, then either
			- The sequence "converges to $\infty$""
			- The sequence converges to some real number a
		- If $|a_i - a| \le b_i$, for all i, and $b_i \to 0$, then $a_i \to a$ 
			- Variation is sandwich argument
				- If we have a certain sequence that converges to some number "a" and we have another sequence that converges to some number "a", and our sequence is somewhere in between, then our sequence must also converge to that particular number "a"
