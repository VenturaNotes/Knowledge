	- [[Total Probability Theorem]]
		- [[Partition]] of sample space into $A_1, A_2, A_3$
			- $A_1$ is a subset or event
			- It is a partition which means these events cover the entire sample space and they're disjoint from each other.
		- Have $P(A_i)$, for every $i$
	- Involves powerful idea of divide and conquer
		- Breakup complex situations into simpler pieces
	- $P(B) = P(B\cap A) + P(B \cap A_2) + P(B\cap A_3)$
		- Due to additivity axiom of probabilities
	- In $P(B) = \Sigma_iP(A_i)P(B|A_i)$
		- $(A_i)$ are the weights
		- Weighted average of $P(B|A_i)$
	- The probability that an event occurs is a weighted average of the probability that it has under each possible scenario where the weights are the probabilities of the different scenarios
	- Would have to use countable additivity axiom for infinite sequence
