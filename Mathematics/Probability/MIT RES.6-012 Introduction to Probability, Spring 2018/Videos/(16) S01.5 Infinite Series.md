	- [[Infinite series]]
		- Defined as the limit as n goes to infinity of the finite series in which we add only the first n terms in the series
		- Definition only makes sense provided the limit exists
		- We denote resulting sum with this notation
			- $\Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty} a_i$
	- If $a_i \ge 0$: limit exists (terms are nonnegative)
		- We consider the [[partial sum]] of the first n terms and then we increase n. This means we add more terms so the partial sum keeps becoming bigger and bigger. The sequence of partial sums is a [[monotonic sequence]]
			- Monotonic sequences always converge either to a finite number or to infinity 
				- In either case, this limit will exist meaning the series is well defined
	- If terms $a_i$ do not all have the same sign
		- Limit need not exist
		- Limit may exist but be different if we sum in a different order
		- Fact: limit exists and independent of order of summation if $\Sigma_{i=1}^{\infty}|a_i| < \infty$ 
			- Sum must be a finite number (this is what < $\infty$ means)
