	- Independence of two events
		- Intuitive "definition": P(B|A) = P(B)
			- Occurrence of A provides no new information about B
	- Definition of [[Independence]]
		- $P(A\cap B) = P(A) * P(B)$
		- Symmetric with respect to A and B
		- implies P(A|B) = P(A)
		- Applies even if P(A) = 0 
	- Independence is a relation about information
	- Two events are independent if the occurrence of one event does not change our beliefs about the other. 
	- In the picture
		- Conclusion of 2 events are not independent. Intuitively, these two events are dependent because if you know that A occurred, then you're sure that B did not occur. Therefore, the occurrence of A tells us a lot about the occurrence of B
	- Being independent is completely different from being disjoint
	- Independent in real world
		- When occurrence of each of 2 events A and B is determined by 2 physically distinct and non-interacting processes
			- If coin results in heads or snow on New Year's Day are 2 events that should be modeled as independent
	- There are some cases where independence is less obvious and where it happens through numerical accident
