	- Sample Space
		- [[Probabilistic model]]: A model of a random phenomenon or experiment
			- Describe possible outcomes
				- List (set) of possible outcomes, $\Omega$ 
					- $\Omega$ is called the sample space (set of all possible outcomes in our experiment)
				- List must be 
					- [[Mutually exclusive]]
						- Only one outcome can happen (not two)
					- [[Collectively exhaustive]]
						- Together, all elements of set exhausts all possibilities.
						- No matter what, at the ned, you will be able to point to one of the outcomes
					- At the "right" [[granularity]]
						- Physically different outcomes should be distinguished in the sample space and correspond to different points
						- Which one is the right sample space depends on what kind of questions you want to answer
							- To determine correct granularity, if you want to test theory if weather determines behavior of coins, then in order to play with theory, work with second sample space
						- Whenever you put together a model, you need to decide how detailed you want your model to be and the right level of detail is the one that captures those aspects that are relevant and of interest to you
						- [[Data granularity]] isÂ **the level of detail considered in a model or decision making process or represented in an analysis report**. The greater the granularity, the deeper the level of detail. [^1]Therefore the top sample space has less granularity but is the perfect amount of detail.
			- Describe beliefs about likelihood of outcomes (by specifying probability laws)
