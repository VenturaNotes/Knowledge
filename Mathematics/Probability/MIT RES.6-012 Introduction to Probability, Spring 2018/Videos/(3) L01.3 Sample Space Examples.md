	- Sample space: discrete/finite example
		- Sample spaces are sets
			- Set can be discrete, finite, infinite, continuous
		- Tetrahedral die: die with 4 faces
			- (3,2) and (2, 3) are separate outcomes
		- [[Sequential Description]]
			- Whenever we have an experiment with several stages (real or imagined). A very useful way of describing it is a sequential description in terms of a tree. Root of tree which we start and endpoints is called the leaves.
		- Number of leaves found is 16

	- Sample space: continuous example
		- Rectangular target in the form of a unit square
			- Suppose you are so skilled that no matter what when you throw the dart, it always falls inside the target
				- Record the coordinates x and y of the particular point that resulted in the dart throw
				- We record x and y with infinite precision so x and y are real numbers
