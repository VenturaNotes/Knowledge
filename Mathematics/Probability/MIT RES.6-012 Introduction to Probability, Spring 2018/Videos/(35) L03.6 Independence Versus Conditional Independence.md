	- We have already seen an example in which we have 2 events that are independent but become dependent in a conditional model
	- Conditioning may affect independence
		- Independence and conditional independence are not the same
	- [[Conditional model]]
	- Given a coin: independent tosses
		- Assuming conditional independence
	- In general model, are coin tosses independent?
	- Independence is about certain conditional probabilities being the same as the unconditional probabilities
	- Conditional probability different from unconditional probability and therefore information in first ten tosses affects beliefs in eleventh toss and therefore we don't have independence between the different tosses
