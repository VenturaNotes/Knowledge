	- [[Variance]] - a measure of the spread of a PMF
		- Random variable X, with mean $\mu$ = $E[X]$
		- Distance from the mean: $X - \mu$ 
		- Average distance from the mean?
		- Definition of variance: $\text{var}(X) = E[(X - \mu)^2]$
			- It is the expected value of the squared distance from the mean
			- Always nonnegative
	- [[Standard deviation]]
		- $\mu_X$ = $\sqrt{\text{var}(X)}$
			- Same units as random variable and captures weight of the distribution

	- Properties of the variance
	- Adding constant just moves entire PMF right or left without changing shape so spread remains unchanged
	- Using linearity of expectations
