	- [[Geometric random variable]]; parameter p: 0 < p $\le$ 1
		- Experiment: infinitely many independent tosses of a coin; P(Heads) = p
			- When we say infinitely many tosses are independent, we mean that any finite subset of those tosses are independent of each other.
		- Sample Space: set of infinite sequences of H and T
		- Random variable X: number of tosses until the first Heads
		- Model of: waiting times; number of trials until a success
	- P(no Heads ever)
		- This is an event that has 0 probability of occurring
	- Sum will be equal to 1
