	- Probability calculation: continuous example
	- Assume probability law is a uniform one
		- [[Uniform probability law]]: Probability = Area
			- Arbitrary choice of a probability law
	- Area of a single point is 0

	- Probability calculation steps (be systematic to always find correct answer)
		- Specify the sample space
		- Specify a probability law
			- Best idea to capture the real world phenomenon you're trying to model
		- Identify an event of interest
			- Describe it in terms of a picture
		- Calculate
			- Quite often the probability law will be given in some implicit manner such as specifying the probabilities of only some of the events. May need additional work then
