	- [[Expectation]]/mean of a random variable (it is a single number that provides some kind of summary of a random variable by telling us what it is on the average)
		- Motivation: Play a game 1000 times. Random gain at each play described by:
			- "Average" gain 
	- Interpretation: Average in large number of independent repetitions of the experiment
	- Caution: If we have an infinite sum, it needs to be well-defined. We assume it's < $\infty$

	- Expectation of a [[Bernoulli random variable]]
		- w.p. means "with probability"
	- If X is the indicator of an event A, $X = I_A$

	- Expectation of a uniform random variable
		- Uniform on 0, 1, ..., n
	- Whenever we have a PMF which is symmetric around a certain point, then the expected value will be the center of symmetry. If we don't have symmetry, the expected value turns out to be the center of gravity of the PMF

	- Expectation as a population average 
		- True average of entire population of students
