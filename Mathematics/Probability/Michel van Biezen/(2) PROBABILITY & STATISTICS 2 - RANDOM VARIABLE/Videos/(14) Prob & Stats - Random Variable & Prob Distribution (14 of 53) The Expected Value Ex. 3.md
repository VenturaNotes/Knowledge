	- `x` is [[random variable]] here which represents value of ticket.
	- [[Expected value]] example
		- You are expected to lose $-\$1.1$  if you buy a ticket. 
		- Are those good odds? 
		- $-1.1$ is bad since people would then be expected to lose money very quickly. You'd want expected value to be closer to maybe a nickel or dime so people keep coming back to bet such as in casinos. 
		- If expected value is very close to zero, that means you almost on average when spending a lot of money gambling, you get almost all of it back and that's what keeps people going at it. Makes people think that they can keep winning money because they come close to breaking even. 
	- This was the expected value of a lottery ticket or raffle ticket
