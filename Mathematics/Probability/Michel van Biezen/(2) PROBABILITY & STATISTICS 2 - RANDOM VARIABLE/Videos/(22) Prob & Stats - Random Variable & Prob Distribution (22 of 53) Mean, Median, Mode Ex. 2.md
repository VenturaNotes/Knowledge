	- Calculating the below with even # of data points
	- Want to first rank data points from lowest to highest value
	- [[Histogram]] is great to give visualization of data points. 
	- [[Mean]]
		- The mean could be offset by a few numbers or data points that are very different from the rest. 
	- [[Median]]
		- Average the middle two values if you have even # of data points
		- Median sometimes gives better feel for typical price of something or value of something
	- [[Mode]]
		- Mode typically tells you what occurs the most (such as 10 houses being sold for exactly $280,000)
	- If average is greater than median, it ends up pushing things to right and that's because there are data points that are large on right side. 
		- If talking about average home prices and median home prices, this situation happens a lot.
		- Sometimes really expensive houses could offset the average of the houses.
