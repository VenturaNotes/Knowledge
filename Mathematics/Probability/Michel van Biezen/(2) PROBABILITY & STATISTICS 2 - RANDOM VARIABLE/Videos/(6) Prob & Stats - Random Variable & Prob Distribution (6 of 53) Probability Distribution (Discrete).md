	- Let X = # of tosses required to get heads
	- Another example of a [[discrete probability distribution]]
	- There is a column for [[cumulative probability]] (at least 1 head)
		- Probability that you get at least one head when you toss it that many times
		- It will add up to 1 if you do it an infinite number of times. However, will never actually get there since you'll always get to the halfway point of the distance remaining.
	- [[Probability distribution graph]]
		- It is [[normalized]]
			- Draw the probability so that when you add up all the values, it should add up to 1
		- Also known as [[probability density function]]?
	- For the # of outcomes vs the # of tosses required to get heads graph, the column will add up to the number of experiments you do.
