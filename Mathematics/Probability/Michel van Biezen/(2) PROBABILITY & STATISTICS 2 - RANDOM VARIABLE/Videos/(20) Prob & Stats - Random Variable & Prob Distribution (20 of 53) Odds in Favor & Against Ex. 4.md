	- If the odds against on a slot machine is 1.1 to 1, what is the probability of winning? What is the expected value? (for double or nothing)
	- You have a 47.6% chance of winning
		- #question Why is this not the percent chance of losing? Does $P(E)$ just mean your benefit automatically? 
	- Expected value is -0.048 which just means for every dollar you put in the slot machine, you lose 4.8 cents.
