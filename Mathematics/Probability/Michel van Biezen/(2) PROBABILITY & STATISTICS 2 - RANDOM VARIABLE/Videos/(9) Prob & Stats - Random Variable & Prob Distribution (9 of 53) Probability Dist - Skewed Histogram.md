	- Let x = # of people in line at the register
		- 100 experiments
	- Distribution functions or what we call probability distributions don't need to be symmetrical. They can be skewed which means that the point where the greatest number of occurrences are doesn't have to be in the center
	- The right graph is a probability distribution graph. It's normalized so that when we add up all the totals, it will add up to exactly 1
		- Also known as probability density graph? 
	- First graph adds up to total number of experiments conducted while right graph has totals add up to 1 for probabilities
	- The graphs we see are skewed graphs
		- The likelihood of 1, 2, or 3 people being in line is much greater than the likelihood of more than 3 people standing in line which is what we can get out of looking at a graph like this.
