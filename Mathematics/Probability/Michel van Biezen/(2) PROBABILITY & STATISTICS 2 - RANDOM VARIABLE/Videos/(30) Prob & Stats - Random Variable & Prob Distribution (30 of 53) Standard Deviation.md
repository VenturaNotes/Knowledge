	- [[Standard deviation]] of a [[random variable]]
	- A standard deviation is a measure like calculating the variance. It's how numbers are distributed. If the standard deviation is small, then the numbers are closely grouped together, not a lot of variation. If standard deviation is large, then the numbers are spread over a much greater range. There is a lot more variation in the numbers associated with what we're looking at. 
	- We can look at millions of different things by drawing variation distributions and that's the graph we have
		- We have a [[gaussian distribution]] or a normal distribution. 
			- A normal distribution means that there is symmetry about the way numbers are arranged. Meaning there's a place where the numbers are basically the average number or the expected value where the greatest occurrence is, the higher this curve, the more numbers are like that and the lower the curve, the less numbers are like that
		- In this case, the curve is supposed to represent the average height of men. 
			- If it's 5'9, 
		- To measure variation in height of men, we use a standard deviation. The symbol we use for standard deviation is
