	- Probability distribution is symmetric here.
	- Calculating the average value vs expected value
	- For expected value
		- The numbers that have a higher probability have more influence on the ultimate result than the numbers that have a smaller probability. 
	- The weighted average (the expected value) is exactly equal to the average value if the distribution is perfectly symmetric on both sides where the middle is the most likely occurrence. So with a perfect distribution.
		- Known as a [[gaussian distribution]]?
	- If distribution the same on both sides, then the expected value will equal the average value.
		- Because then it doesn't matter if you weigh the average because the distribution doesn't require it.
			- However, in most cases, you are not expected to get this perfectly neat distribution so expected value would be different from average value.
