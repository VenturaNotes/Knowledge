	- Odds of [[roulette]]
		- There are 18 black slots, 18 red slots, 1 0 slot, and 1 00 slot
			- In Europe, there is only 1 green so bank doesn't make as much.
	- Odds in favor of winning
		- $\frac {P(E)}{1 - P(E)}$
			- Probability that event you want will occur divided by probability that event will not occur
	- Odds against winning
		- $\frac {1 - P(E)}{P{E}}$
			- Probability of event not occurring divided by probability that event will occur
	- If you get odds greater than 1, it's more likely to occur. More than a 50/50 chance of that happening. More likely. 
		- If < 1, less than likely to occur and so < 50% chance of occurring.
