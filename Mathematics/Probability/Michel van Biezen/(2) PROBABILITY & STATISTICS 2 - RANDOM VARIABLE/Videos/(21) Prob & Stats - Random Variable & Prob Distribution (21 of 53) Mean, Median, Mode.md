	- (odd # of data points)
	- Commuting times (in minutes)
	- [[Mean]] = (average) = equation
	- [[Median]] = (middle reading) = (half are less and half are more)
		- Easier to find median with odd # of data points
	- [[Mode]] = (value that occurs the most)
	- Could graph on [[histogram]] to show how many of each commuting time occurs. 
		- Will draw bars to represent occurrences of commuting time.
	- Adding many numbers
		- 24 + 21 + 23 + 28 + 23 + 23 + 25 + 22 + 25 + 24 + 26
			- A mental trick to add them together is that since they're all close to 25, just do $25*11$ = 275 and then find the difference of 25 between each point and add that to 275. Since the difference was found to be $-11$, we have $275-11 = 264$ which is the summation of the 11 data points. 
	- You can have the same mean and median value.
	- If median is close to the mean, that means the distribution is somewhat even. It's not very skewed to one side or the other.
	- If the distribution is skewed to one side, then the mean and median are typically not the same.
