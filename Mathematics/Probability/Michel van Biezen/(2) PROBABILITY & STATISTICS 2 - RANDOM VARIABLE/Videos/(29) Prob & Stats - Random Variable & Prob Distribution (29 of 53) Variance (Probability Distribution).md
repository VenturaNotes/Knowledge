	- [[Variance]] (values with probability distribution)
		- Variance is the sum of the probability of each event occurring times the difference between the number and the expected value quantity squared
		- The expected value is found by taking the probability of each event, multiplying it by the value of each, adding it up, and getting the expected value which is the weighted average of all the numbers 
	- Probability of occurrence shown below each of the values. 
	- The average value is only good when adding all the numbers and dividing by the quantity of numbers to get the average value. Can't do that for this data set as we have an uneven distribution in how they can occur. 
	- Notice that the probabilities are normalized (if you add up all the probabilities, they equal 1)
	- The reason why the expected value and middle number are equal is because we have a distribution that is symmetric on both sides of the number 4. 
	- Variance is an indication of how the numbers are spread out. Notice how the average value is 4, the expected value is 4, and you can see the variance is 2.1 which is not that large or not that small relative to the number 4. 
		- Variance gives indication how wide the numbers are spread. If you have a lot of big outliers far away from the average of the mean or expected value, in this case no so the variance is relatively small.  
	- This is how we calculate the variance in the case that we don't have an even distribution of probabilities for the values.
