	- Homeowner Insurance
	- Insurance company has 1,000,000 policies
	- Average value = $200,000
	- $E(x) = ?
	- $E(x) = $\Sigma P_ix_i$ 
	- Research shows that over the last 10 years
		- 6 homes per year are a total loss
		- 2000 homes per year report loss of $3000 average
	- What would the premium need to be for the break-even point assuming no profit and no coverage for expenses. So finding the minimum price (premium) that the payments of the home owners need to be. 
	- Premiums are large because it takes a large amount of money to run these companies but not necessarily large because they have to cover a lot of damage claims. 
		- Of course, it all depends where it is, what the risks are, and what the probabilities are of these particular damage claims. 
		- That's how we work with the expected value to figure out what insurance company premiums ought to be.
