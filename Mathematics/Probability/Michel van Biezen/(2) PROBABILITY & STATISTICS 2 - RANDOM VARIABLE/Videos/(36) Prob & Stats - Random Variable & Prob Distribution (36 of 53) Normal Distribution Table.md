	- The normal distribution table
	- We have a normal distribution of values. We call it a normal distribution because the total area underneath the whole curve from $- \infty$ to $+\infty$ = 1
	- The [[error function]] is after the constant
		- $\frac {1}{\sqrt 2\pi}[\frac{b}{\sigma} - \frac{b^3}{6\sigma^3} + \frac{b^5}{40\sigma^5}...]$
	- `b` is usually expressed in terms of a fraction of a $\sigma$ 
	- If we let $b = 1.5\sigma$, then we can find on the table `fraction of sigma = 1.5` and then we see that `area = 0.4432`
