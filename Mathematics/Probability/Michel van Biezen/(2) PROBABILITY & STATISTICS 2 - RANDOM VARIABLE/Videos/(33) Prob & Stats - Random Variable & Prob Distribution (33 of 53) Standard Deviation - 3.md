	- [[Standard deviation]] of a [[random variable]]
	- Two tire companies trying to produce a 30,000 mile tire.
	- Standard deviation is so important to understand how many of your product will fall within the acceptable limits and how many will not fall within acceptable limits. 
		- All we have to do is sample a relatively small number out of the total population to get a nice normal distribution
	- Don't want the right graph because if the car is advertised to have tires that go for 30,000 miles but has a $\sigma = 10,000$, then out of a population of a million cars with the average tires going $40,000$ miles, then 16% of that population will have tires not going that distance which means almost 160,000 cars will not go that distance out of the million. Means manufacturing process is bad.
