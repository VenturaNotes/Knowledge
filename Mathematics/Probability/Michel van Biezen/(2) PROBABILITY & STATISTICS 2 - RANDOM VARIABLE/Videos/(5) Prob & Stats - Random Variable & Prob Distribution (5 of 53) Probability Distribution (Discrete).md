	- X = # of heads when tossing a coin 3 times
	- [[Probability distribution]]
	- Can graph it
		- Vertical axis is number of occurrences and horizontal access is the value for x which is our random variable 
	- The graph is what we call a probability distribution
	- Will put on vertical access now the probabilities for the value of X being 0, 1, 2, or 3
		- Adding all probabilities of a random variable will equal one.
		- If they don't add up to one, you don't have a proper probability distribution
	- This is our first example of a [[discrete probability distribution]]
		- Sum off all columns must add up to 1
