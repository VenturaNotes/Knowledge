	- [[Histogram]]
		- No difference than a distribution graph we've seen before
	- [[Random variable]] in this case is `x` which will take on the value of the 2 dice we just tossed. Summing up the two values together to get the variable `x` 
	- The probabilities should add up to 1
	- So we have a [[probability distribution]] that is [[normalized]] in such a way that if you add up all the sums (all the totals of the probabilities), they should add up to 1
	- Vertical axis of first graph is probabilities. Vertical axis of second graph is # of occurrences.
		- Shape of two and relative height is identical 
	- A histogram shows the number of occurrences and the first graph with the probability on the vertical axis shows basically the exact same graph
		- The only difference is that the first graph is [[normalized]] in such a way that when you add up all the totals, you get 1
		- The second graph when adding up all the totals gives the number of experiments done. 
	- Both graphs are histograms
		- First one is a [[probability density distribution]]
		- Second one is simply a histogram showing the number of occurrences as a function of the total number of experiments that's been performed.
	- A histogram is just another name for a probability distribution or a graph that shows the number of occurrences vs the possibilities
