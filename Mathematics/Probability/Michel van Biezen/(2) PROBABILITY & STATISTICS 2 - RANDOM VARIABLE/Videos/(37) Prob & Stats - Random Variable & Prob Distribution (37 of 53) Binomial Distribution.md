	- What is a [[binomial distribution]]? (different from normal distribution)
	- It is a distribution of the results of a binomial experiment
	- They consist of:
		- (1) n identical experiments (or trials)
			- Will do the experiments over and over again
			- `n` could be a small number like 2 or 3
				- Could also be 2 thousand or a million.
				- There are differences between them.
		- (2) Each trial has 2 outcomes
			- Like heads or tails
			- Bi means two
		- (3) The probability for each outcome does not change
			- Every time you flip a coin, 50% heads and 50% tails
			- Probability for heads or tails doesn't change
		- (4) All trials are independent
			- If you flip a coin once and then again, the outcome of second flip in no way depends on outcome of second flip (completely independent)
		- p = probability of success
		- q = probability of failure
		- n + q = 1
			- n and p don't need to be equal
	- Toss a coin 5 times
		- success $\to$ heads
			- $p = 0.5$ 
			- $q = 0.5$
		- 5 trials
			- Success would be heads so
				- probability of success `p` is equal to 0.5 as probability of getting heads is 50%
				- probability of failure `q` is 0.5 as probability of getting tails is 50%
	- Since it's a [[binomial distribution]] we can use [[binomial expansion]] to figure out the numbers
		- So if you toss a coin 5 times, the possible outcomes is 32 combinations
		- So when you do binomial expansion, you find $\frac {1}{32}$% chance you get 0 heads. Then $\frac {5}{32}$% chance for 1 head, and so on.
