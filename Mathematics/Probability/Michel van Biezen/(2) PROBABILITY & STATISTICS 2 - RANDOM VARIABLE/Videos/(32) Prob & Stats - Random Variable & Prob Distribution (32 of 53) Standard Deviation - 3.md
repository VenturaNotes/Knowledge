	- Find standard deviation of a random variable but in this case, it will be a sample. It's going to be a number of values picked from a very large population.
	- Potato chip factory
		- 9.8 ounce bags of potato chips 
		- Randomly pick 60 bags and weigh
		- The values are a random sample drawing of the total population.
	- $\sigma = \sqrt{\frac{\Sigma ( x_i - \overline x)^2}{n-1}}$
		- The rule is that if we have a sample of a total population and the population is very large, we then want to use `n-1` rather than `n`. 
			- `n-1` because sample of a larger population
		- If we have the whole population considered (all the potato chip bags), then we would just divide by `n`
	- The larger your sample, the closer you'll get to a normal distribution. 
	- So calculating the standard deviation gives us a really good picture of what the general layout is of the values we can expect. Like in this case, the number of ounces in a potato chip bag.
