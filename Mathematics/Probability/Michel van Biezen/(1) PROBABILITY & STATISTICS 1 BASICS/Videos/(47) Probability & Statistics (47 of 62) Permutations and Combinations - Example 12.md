	- Seating at a round table - A simple example
		- 6 people sitting at a round table
			- (a) No restrictions
			- (b) 2 cannot sit next to each other
				- We calculate all the permutations that can sit together and then calculate the permutations where two must sit together.
				- We treat 5 and 6 as a single group so we'd have $P_5$ and then the permutations of 5 and 6 themselves would be 2!
