	- [[De Morgan's Law]]
	- Sets
		- [[Sample space]]
			- $\Omega$ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
					- All possible outcomes of the sample space are numbers 1 through 10
		- [[event|Events]] (The outcome of A, B, C, and D are a portion of the sample space. They are all subsets of the sample space)
			- A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
			- B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
			- C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
			- D = {4, 8}
		- A and B are considered [[independent events]]. All the elements in A do not belong to B and all the elements in B do not belong to A. They are completely independent.
		- In A and C, there is some dependency. Some of the elements within them are the same
		- D has dependency with B and C. Not A
		- [[Complement]] symbol
			- $(A \cup C)^c = A^c \cap C^c$
				- The complement means everything outside that belongs in there
				- For example, the complement of A would be all the elements in the sample space that do not belong to A
				- The complement of B is all the elements in the sample space that do not belong to B
				- We notice though that the complement of A is B and vice versa
	- [[DeMorgan's Laws]]
		- $(A \cup C)^c = A^c \cap C^c$
			- By inspection, we could prove it by drawing out $A^c$ and $C^c$ and then finding the intersection between them which ends up being $(A \cup C)^c$ 
		- $(A \cap C)^c = A^c \cup C^c$ 
			- By inspection, can draw it out to show this is true
