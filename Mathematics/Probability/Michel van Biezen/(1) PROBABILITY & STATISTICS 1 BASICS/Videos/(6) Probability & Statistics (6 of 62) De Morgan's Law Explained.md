- Sample Space
	- $\Omega$ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
- Events (All subsets of sample space)
	- A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
	- B = {2, 4, 6, 8 , 10}
	- C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	- D = {4, 8}
	- Notes
		- A and B are completely independent events.
			- All elements in A do not belong to B.
			- All elements in B do not belong to A
		- A and C have some dependency
			- Some of the elements within them are the same
		- D has dependency with B and C but not with A

	- C means complement (everything outside that belongs in A)
	- Complement of A is all elements in sample space that do not belong to A
	- Complement of A is B and Complement of B is actually A
	- Union of A and C
		- All elements that belong to A, all elements that belong to C, and all elements that belong to both A and C.
	- Union ($\cup$)  means together
	- Intersections ($\cap$)  means elements that belong to both A and C
	- Proof

			- Intersection is whatever belongs to both.
			- Intersection is what is common between both
			- By inspection, we can see that the law above is true

	- Proof

			- The only thing that doesn't belong to either is the overlap of A and C.
			- By inspection, we see it.
