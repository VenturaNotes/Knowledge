	- $P(A_2 | A_1)$ = The [[conditional probability]] of $A_2$ given $A_1$
		- = The probability that $A_2$ will occur provided $A_1$ has occurred
			- This is better wording
	- $P(A_2|A_1)$ = $\frac {P(A_2 \cap A_1)}{P(A_1)}$
		- First part of statement is read as "The probability of event 2 depending on event 1"
		- It's read as "The conditional probability of $A_2$ given $A_1$ "
	- Conditional probability is when there is more than one event. There is a sample space. And the probability of the second event depends on the probability of the first event having occurred. 
	- Example: Tossing a die
		- If we toss a die and we know that the number is odd, then the probability that the number will also be less than 4 is $\frac 23$
