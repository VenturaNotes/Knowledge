	- (1) If $A \subset B$ and $B \subset C$ then A $\subset C$
	- (2) $A \cup B = B \cup A$
		- All of the outcomes in A + all the outcomes in B + all outcomes in both A and B
	- (3) $A \cup (B \cup C) = (A \cup B) \cup C = A \cup B \cup C$
	- (4) $A \cap B = B \cap A$
	- (5) $A \cap (B \cap C) = (A \cap B) \cap C = A \cap B \cap C$
	- #question What are the names of all these theorems?
