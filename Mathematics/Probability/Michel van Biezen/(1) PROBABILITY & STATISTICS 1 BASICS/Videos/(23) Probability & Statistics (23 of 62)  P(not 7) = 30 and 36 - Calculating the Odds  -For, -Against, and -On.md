	- Definition: The [[odds for an event]] A = $\frac{P(A)}{P(\text{Not A)}}$
	- Definition: The [[odds against an event]] A = $\frac {P(\text {Not A})}{P(A)}$
	- Definition: The [[odds on event]] A = The Odds against event A
		- Not universal but typically what it means
	- Ex 1: Coin toss $\to$ odds for getting heads
		- The odds for getting heads is 1
			- Will see later why this is the case in [[horse racing]]
	- Ex 2: Die $\to$ Odds for getting A 4
		- The odds for getting a 4 is $\frac {1}{5}$
	- Ex: 3 Dice $\to$ Odds for rolling a 7
		- In comment section
			- Probability of not rolling a 7 should be $\frac {30}{36}$
