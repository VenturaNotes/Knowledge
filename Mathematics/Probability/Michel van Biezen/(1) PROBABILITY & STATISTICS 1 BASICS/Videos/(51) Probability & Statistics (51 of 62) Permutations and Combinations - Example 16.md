	- There are 6 republicans and 6 democrats. You want to form a committee of 3 republicans and 2 democrats
		- (a) No restrictions
		- (b) 1 specific democrat must be on the committee
			- The reason you do $_5C_1$ is because you already have 1 democrat on there by default (specifically), and now you're just looking for the number of combinations for the other one.
		- (c) 2 particular republicans cannot be on the committee
