	- (1)
		- If n = # of sample points in sample space (S)
		- k = # of sample points in A where $A \subset S$
		- $P(A) = \frac kn$ 
			- Then the probability that event A will occur is simply the ratio of the total number of sample points in A divided by the total number of sample points in the sample space.
		- [[mutually exclusive]]
	- (2) This example is [[mutually exclusive]]. You cannot pull out a king of hearts in event B and expect that they exist in event A
		- $P(A \text{ or } B) = P(A \cup B) = $P(A) + P(B)$ 
			- Since they are mutually exclusive, you simply add the two together
	- (3) $A = \{H\} \text { and } B = \{K\}$ ([[dependent]])
		- P(A or B) = $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
		- The probability of pulling a heart or a king card is $\frac {4}{13}$
