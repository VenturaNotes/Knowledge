	- On board
		- Flipping n coins
		- $\Omega$ = {$2^n$ outcomes}
		- let k = # of heads (where n $\le$ k $\le$ 0)
		- P(k heads, n-k tails) $\frac{n \choose k}{2^n}$
	- Will now find the more general equation for the probability of some sort of outcome or some sort of event for flipping a coin or anything that has to do with a binary situation
	- K will always be between 0 and the total number of n
		- If you have 4 coins, maximum number of k is 4 and the minimum number would be 0 (of course then all of them would be tails)
	- The [[sample space]] (the number of outcomes will be $2^n$ outcomes)
	- $n \choose k$ = $\frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$
		- This represents the number of outcomes for that particular event
		- This is some sort of event where we get k heads and n-k tails
		- The exclamation mark means [[factorial]]
			- 5! is read as "five factorial" = $1*2*3*4*5=120$
	- For P(1-H, 3-T) = $\frac{1}{4}$
		- In this case, we don't care about the order of the heads and tails
