	- How many ways can you place 7 numbers on the left side and 3 numbers on the right side?
		- Order does not matter
		- S = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}
	- [[Combination]]
	- $_{10}C_7$ $=$ $_{10}C_3$
		- Seems like the number of combinations is 120 because when choosing 7, you automatically leave 3 behind (where order does not matter in this case)
