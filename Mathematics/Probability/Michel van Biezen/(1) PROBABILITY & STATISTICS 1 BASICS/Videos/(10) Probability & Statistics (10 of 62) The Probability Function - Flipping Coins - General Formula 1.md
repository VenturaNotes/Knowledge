	- There is a lot of similarity between binomial expansions and the number of elements you find in the events of a sample space when you flip a certain number of coins
	- Flip 2 coins, the coefficients look like the coefficients of a binomial expansion
	- Use 3 coins, you have $(a+b)^3$ and same coefficients as number of elements in the sample space
	- Use 4 coins $(a+b)^4$, same coefficients in binomial expansion of the 4th power as you have elements in the events of the sample space with 4 coins.
	- Those coefficients when expanding them should remind you of Pascal's Triangle
		- 4th row expansion
			- 1+2 = 3
			- 2+1 = 3
		- 5th row expansion
			- 1 + 3 = 4
			- 3 + 3 = 6
			- 3 + 1 = 4
		- 6th row expansion
			- 1 + 4 = 5
			- 4 + 6 = 10
			- 6 + 4 = 10
			- 4 +1 = 5
		- 7th row expansion
			- 1 + 5 = 6
			- 5 + 10 = 15
			- 10 + 10 = 20
			- 10 + 5 = 15
			- 5 + 1 = 6
			- In the case of 6 coins
				- 1 case - 6 heads
				- 6 cases - 5 heads and 1 tails
				- 15 cases - 4 heads and 2 tails
				- 20 cases - 3 heads and 3 tails
				- 15 cases - 2 heads and 4 tails
				- 6 cases - 1 head and 5 tails
				- 1 case - 6 tails
				- Adding them all up gives 64 outcomes = $2^6$ 
				- P(4H, 2T) = $\frac {15} {64}$
					- Probability of 4 heads and 2 tails is $\frac {15}{16}$
	- If you want to determine how many possibilities you have with a certain number of heads and a certain number of tails, when you flip a coin, you can use Pascal's Triangle to come up with the number and therefore the probability.
- In the next video, we'll find the general equation to find the probability for any sort of outcome when flipping coins.
