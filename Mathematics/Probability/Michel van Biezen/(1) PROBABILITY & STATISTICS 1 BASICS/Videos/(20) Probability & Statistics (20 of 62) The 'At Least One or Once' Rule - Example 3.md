	- (a) Rolling a die twice $\to$ P(At least one 3) = ?
	- (b) Rolling a die 3 times
	- (c) How many attempts are needed to get P(at least one 3) = 0.99?
		- 26 tries would be minimum required for 99% probability to get at least one time the number 3
	- [[At least once rule (probability)|at least once rule]]
	- Can take the [[natural log]] and move the exponent out front. Could also just do $log_{10}$ as well
