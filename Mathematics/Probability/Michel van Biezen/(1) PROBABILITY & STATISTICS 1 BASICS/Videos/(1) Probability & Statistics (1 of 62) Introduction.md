	- [[Probability]] $\equiv$ The prediction of a certain outcome when something occurs
		- If probability is high, very likely event or outcome will occur
		- If probability is low, unlikely for outcome to occur
		- Ex: 
			- A) Toss a Die
				- What is the probability we get a 1?
			- B) Flip a coin
				- Heads or tails?
				- What is the likelihood of heads or tails
			- C) Draw a card
	- 3 Types of Probabilities
		- (1) [[Theoretical probability]] $\rightarrow$ based on predictable parameters
			- P(tossing a Five) = $\frac 16$ 
				- die has 6 sides
			- P(Drawing a Spade) = $\frac 14$ 
			- We pretty much know what the probability will be
		- (2) [[Empirical probability]] $\to$ based on historical and geological records
			- P(Strong Earthquake in the next 10 years)
				- Based on gathering data and scientific information
				- Then based upon that information, we can make a pretty good assessment of what the probability is that some other event or outcome will occur.
			- P(Getting into a car accident)
				- Insurance companies use a lot of information about demographics of a population to how likely it is someone will get into a car accident
					- Young driver with little experience are more likely to get into an accident
					- Person who has been driving for awhile has a lower probability of getting into an accident
		- (3) [[Subjective Probability]] $\to$ based on experience or intuition
			- P(getting hurt when falling off a bicycle)
				- Can say there is a high probability of getting hurt when falling off if you're going 10 or 20mph. Pretty confident about it without any data.
				- May have not experienced it or data on it, but with confidence, we can say there is a pretty high probability we would get hurt
			- May not necessarily be keeping track of a particular event or outcome
			- Based on experiences, can get a pretty good idea of what the probability is that something else will happen
