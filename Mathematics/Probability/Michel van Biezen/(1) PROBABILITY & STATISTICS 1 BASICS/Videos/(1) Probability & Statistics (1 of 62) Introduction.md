- Probability $\equiv$ The prediction of a certain outcome when something occurs
	- Ex: 
		- A) Toss a Die
			- What is the probability we get a 1?
		- B) Flip a coin
			- Heads or tails?
		- C) Draw a card
	- If probability is high, very likely event or outcome will occur
		- If probability is low, unlikely to occur
## 3 Types of Probabilities
- (1) [[Theoretical probability]] $\rightarrow$ based on predictable parameters
	- P(tossing a Five) = $\frac 16$ 
		- die has 6 sides
	- P(Drawing a Spade) = $\frac 14$ 
	- We pretty much know what the probability will be
- (2) [[Empirical probability]] $\to$ based on historical and geological records
	- P(Strong Earthquake in the next 10 years)
		- Based on gathering data and scientific information
	- P(Getting into a car accident)
		- Insurance companies use a lot of information about demographics of a population to how likely it is someone will get into a car accident
			- Young driver with little experience are more likely to get into an accident
			- Person who has been driving for awhile has a lower probability of getting into an accident
- (3) [[Subjective Probability]] $\to$ based on experience or intuition
	- P(getting hurt when falling off a bicycle)
	- May not necessarily be keeping track of a particular event
	- Can say there is a high probability of getting hurt when falling off if you're going 10 or 20mph. Pretty confident about it without any data.
