	- Going to talk about now where [[Bayes' Theorem]] came from
	- Bottom part of Bayes' Theorem comes from:
		- If we got a blue or red marble, what is the probability that we tossed a heads or tossed a tails
	- The top part of Bayes' Theorem is simply one of these elements
		- So if the probability of one of these events occurring $A_i$ meaning $A_1$ and $A_2$ and so forth, times the probability that we pull a red or blue marble provided either heads or tails was tossed.
		- It's a singular event divided by the sum of them which will give us the probability that $A_i$ will occur provided that A has occurred. A will either be pulling a red or blue marble which will result in the probability that heads or tails was throw on the coin
	- The heads or tails are the independent events that drove the decision as to which bag we're going to pull a marble from
	- Summary
		- The probability of A (pulling a red or blue marble out of one of the two bags) is the denominator based theorem 
		- The numerator is the probability of either throwing heads or tails multiplied by the probability of pulling a blue marble providing that you threw either heads or tails
