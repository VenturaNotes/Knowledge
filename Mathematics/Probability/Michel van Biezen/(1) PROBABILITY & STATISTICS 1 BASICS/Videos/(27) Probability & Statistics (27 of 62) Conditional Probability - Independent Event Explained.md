	- Looking at [[conditional probability]] with [[independent events]]
	- The probability of the second event does not depend on the first event.
	- Toss a die twice
	- Probability that event $A_1$ and $A_2$ will occur
		- $P(A_1 \cap A_2) = P(A_1) \times P(A_2 |A_1)$
			- This is the independent formula
			- Just ends up being product of both probabilities
			- Two events are completely independent of one another
		- $P(A_2|A_1)$ = $\frac {P(A_2 \cap A_1)}{P(A_1)}$
			- This is the dependent formula for conditional probability
	- There will be some examples where something will happen in the first event that will affect we look at the probability of the second event. Even though the events are independent, it will still affect the second event and we'll see an example of that in the next video
