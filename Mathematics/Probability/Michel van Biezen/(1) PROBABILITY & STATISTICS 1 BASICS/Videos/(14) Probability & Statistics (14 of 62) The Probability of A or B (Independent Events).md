	- Board
		- What is P(A or B)?
			- For independent events
				- P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
			- P(3 or Even #) = ?
		- Rolling A die
			- $\Omega$ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6}
			- A = {3}, B = {2, 4, 6}
	- Will now find the probability of an or or an either condition
		- A or B
		- A either B
	- Will look at it as [[independent events]]
	- Just add the probabilities of the events together as long as they're independent
