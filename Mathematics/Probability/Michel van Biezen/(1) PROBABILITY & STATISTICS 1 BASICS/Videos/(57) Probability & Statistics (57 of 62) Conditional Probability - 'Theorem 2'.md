	- If an event A must result in one of the [[mutually exclusive]] events $A_1, A_2, ...,A_n$ then
	- $P(A) = P(A_1)*P(A|A_1)+P(A_2)P(A|A_2)+...+P(A_n)*P(A|A_n)$
		- $P(A) = \Sigma^n_{i=1}P(A_1)*P(A|A_i)$ 
		- That is what this conditional probability theory is about
			- It's about finding what may happen if something else has happened before
		- This is an important aspect of what we'll eventually see as [[Bayes' theorem]]
			- Bayes' Theorem can help us predict something that must have happened if something else happened before. 
	- An example of a mutually exclusive event could be grabbing marbles from a bag
		- It will result in either grabbing a red or blue one. 
		- So what is the probability of grabbing a red or blue one. 
		- We can reverse the process so that let's say we grab a green one, what is the probability that we toss either heads or tails (this is in reverse)
	- [[conditional probability]]
	- #question which theorem does this use?
