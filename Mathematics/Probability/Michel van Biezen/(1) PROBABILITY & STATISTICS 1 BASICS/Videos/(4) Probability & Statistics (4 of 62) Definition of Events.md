	- [[Event]] = subset of a sample space
		- It's a subset of a set of possible outcomes
		- $\Omega$ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} Toss a die
	- Event = Tossing an even number = {2, 4, 6}
	- P(Event) = $\frac 36$ = $\frac 12$ 
		- There are 3 possible outcomes out of a total of 6 outcomes in the sample space.
