	- [[Probability Function]] $\to$ P
		- The probability function can be a mathematical function like an equation but in this case, we'll look at it in a simplistic manner
			- We use the letter "P" to indicate a probability function
			- Could only have a number between 0 and 1 in a probability function. Could be 0 or 1 as well.
				- 0 means there is a 0 probability the event will occur. If it is a 1, then there is a 100% probability that the event will occur
		- It assigns a number from 0 to 1 to each event in $\Omega$ such that
			- $P(\Omega) = 1$
				- The probability that the events will occur in the sample space is equal to 1
				- This just means there is a 100% probability that the outcome will be some element of the sample space 
					- Since the sample space represents all possible outcomes, there is a 100% probability that the outcome will be one of those elements.
			- P(A) = $\frac{\text {Number of Ways A can occur}}{\text{Total Number of outcomes}}$
				- The probability that some event will occur is equal to the number of ways A can occur divided by the total number of outcomes.
			- $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B)$
				- [[Disjoint]]
				- A and B are considered disjoint here
			- $P(A \cup C) = P(A) + P(C) - P(A \cap C)$
				- [[Overlapping Sets|Overlapping]]
				- Sets A and C are overlapping
