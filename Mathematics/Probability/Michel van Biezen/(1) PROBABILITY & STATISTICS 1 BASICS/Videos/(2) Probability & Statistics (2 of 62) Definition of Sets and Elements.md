	- [[Set]] is composed of elements or members where each element is a possible outcome
		- A set is denoted by capital letters
	- Example 1
		- A = {a, b, c, d}
			- Could be the answer to a multiple choice test
			- Question could be what is the probability of a or b or c or d.
		- a $\in$ A
			- a is an element of A
			- belongs to set A
	- Example 2
		- B = {e, f, g, h}
		- a $\notin$ B
			- a does not belong to B
		- a, b $\in$ A
			- This says that a and b belongs to set A
	- A set can be defined in two ways
		- (1) Listing all the elements A = {a, l, c, d}
		- (2) Describing the properties held by the members and/or non-members
			- Could be even numbers
			- A = {First 4 letters of the alphabet}
				- So the elements would be `a, b, c, and d`
