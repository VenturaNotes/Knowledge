	- [[Sample Space]] ($\Omega$) $\equiv$ A set whose elements describe the outcomes of the experiment of interest
		- Could have one or more outcomes
		- The outcomes are going to be the elements of the set and the set is then called the sample space
		- The sample space encompasses all of the possible outcomes
	- Examples
		- $\Omega$ = {Head, Tail} Coin Toss
			- The only 2 outcomes we can have in the experiment
		- $\Omega$ = {Jan, Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Agu, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec}
			- Determine the month a student is born in
		- Determine the various ways (and the number of ways) 3 colored marbles can be place
			- $\Omega$ = {RBG, RGB, BGR, BRG, GBR, GRB}
				- The # of elements = n! = 3! = 1 * 2 * 3 = 6
					- 6 possible outcomes so 6 possible elements in the sample space
					- Using [[factorial]] here
			- Add a 4th color (y)
			- $\Omega$ = {YRBG, YRGB, ... ...} $\implies$ # of elements = n! = 4! = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 = 24
				- This tells us how many different ways we can line up a 4 marbles
