	- Key
		- Sample Space:
			- $\Omega$ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}
		- Sets (subsets of the sample space)
			- A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
				- Odd numbers
			- B = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10}
				- Even Numbers
			- C = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
				- First 5 numbers
			- D = {4, 8}
	- [[Intersection]] 
		- Only those element (numbers) that are common to both subsets
		- $\Omega$ represents all possible outcomes. It could be everything. Not just the sample space but the entire universe. Any possible outcome for any event or experiment we do.
			- Can define it as: what belongs in the box is the total sample space and everything else is simply a subset of the sample space.
	- [[Union]]
		- All numbers that either belong to A and/or C.
	- [[Complement]]
		- Compliment of a set is all of the numbers that do not belong to that set
		- All elements not in A is the compliment of A.
	- [[Disjoint]]
		- When 2 sets have nothing in common. No elements in common
		- Disjoint sets are when two sets have no elements in common
	- [[Subset]]
		- All numbers in D belongs in B so D is a subset of B.
	- [[Difference]]
		- What is in B but not in D?
			- All the elements in B, not in D.
		- Since all the elements in D also belong to B, you subtract all elements in D from B. What is left over is B - D or the difference of B and D. 
	- Intersection, Union, and Compliment. They are all part of set of things we call [[Venn diagram|Venn diagrams]]
		- Venn Diagrams are used to illustrate graphically what sets and what sample spaces are and unions. Makes them easier to comprehend since we can visually see them.
