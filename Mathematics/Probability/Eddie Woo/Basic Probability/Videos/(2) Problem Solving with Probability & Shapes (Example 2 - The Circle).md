	- Question
		- "P and Q are ends of the diameter of a circle with radius 10cm. A point is chosen at random on the circumference of the circle. Find the probability that the points within 10cm of either P or Q or distances being measured along the circumference. "
	- "dia" means "across"
	- Diameter is all the way across the circle (must pass through center.)
	- Radius is half the diameter
	- Circumference is "the linear distance around a circle [^1]
	- Formula for area of a circle: $\pi r^2$
	- Formula for circumference of a circle $2\pi r$
