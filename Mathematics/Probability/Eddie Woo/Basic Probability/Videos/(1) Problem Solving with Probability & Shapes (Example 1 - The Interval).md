	- Working mathematically
		- Why is this harder?
			- More complicated / more steps
			- Combines topics
			- Don't provide all information
		- Probability = $\frac {\text{favorable outcomes (or events)}}{\text{sample space}}$
		- Question
			- A point is chosen at random on an interval of length 25cm. Find the probability that the point is more than 6cm from the middle.
				- Read the question part by part.
		- The points "x" are not part of the sample space (sample space will be on the line though)
		- Probability doesn't have units attached to it (since the units cancel)
		- If there are measurements or shapes involved, the first thing you should start doing is drawing (diagramming)
