	- A [[Permutation|permutation]] is an ordering of objects
		- To find number of permutations of cat, it's $3!$
			- So the general expression is $n!$ to find the number of permutations
	- What if we take permutations of n objects r at a time? ^139416
		- 2 letter word using 3 letters
			- $_nP_r$
				- How of "n" objects, how many ways are there to pick "r" of them where the order is important
					- Formula is $\frac {n!}{(n-r)!}$
					- Would have six outcomes
						- CA, CT, AC, AT, TA, TC
		- If you had a word such as "attic", you would just count the 2 t's as one.
	- [[Combination]] is where order is not important ^73de9f
		- Would have 3 distinct/unique outcomes
			- CA, CT, TA
		- Formula
			- $_nC_r = \frac {n!}{(n-r)!r!}$

	- If you take a word such as Algebra and you want to find out the number of permutations of all the letters in the word algebra, you can see there are 7 letters so $7!$ ways of rearranging them.
		- When there are multiple letters, you want to divide out those multiplicities
	- Example #1: If there are 10 people on a committee, how many ways are there of choosing a president, V.P, and secretary? 
		- 720
	- Example #2: If there are 30 people on your tennis team, how many ways can you chose 2 co-captains?
	- Example #3: If a board has 10 women and 7 men, how many ways can you form a committee containing 4 members such that:
		- All 4 are men?
			- Combination because order not important
		- 2 are men and 2 are women
			- Multiply 2 combinations together (using the [[fundamental counting principle]])
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">At least one</mark> is a woman? 
			- When you see the phrase "at least one", you take the total and subtract by none

	- How card games work
		- 52 cards in a deck
		- 26 red and 26 black
		- 4 suites
			- 13 diamonds and 13 hearts (red cards)
			- 13 clubs and 13 spades (black cards)
			- KQJ (face cards)
			- Numbered cards (2-10)
			- A (1 ace)
	- Example #4: How many ways are there of being dealt a 5 card hand out of a standard 52 card deck if:
		- (a) All are diamonds
			- 13C5
		- (b) Contains <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">exactly</mark> 1 face card
		- (c) No queens
		- (d) All hearts or all spades
		- (e) At most 1 club
		- Probability
			- P = $\frac{\text{\# successes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}}$
			- (f) What is the probability of being dealt all numbered cards?
			- (g) What is the probability of getting at least 1 ace?
