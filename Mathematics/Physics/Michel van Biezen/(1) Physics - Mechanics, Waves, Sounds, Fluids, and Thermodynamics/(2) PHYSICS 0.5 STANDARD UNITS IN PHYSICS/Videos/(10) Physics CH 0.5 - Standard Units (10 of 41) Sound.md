	- $P = BkA$
		- Pressure of a [[pressure wave]] or sound wave
		- B = [[Bulk Modulus]]
		- k = [[wavenumber]]
		- A = [[Amplitude of oscillation of wave]]
	- $v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}$
		- Velocity of wave in [[air]]
		- $\rho$ = density of air
	- $I = \frac 12 \sqrt{\rho B} w^2 A^2$
		- Intensity of a [[sound wave]]
		- $\omega$ is the [[angular frequency]]
			- Angular frequency is also 1 over seconds
		- A is the amplitude
			- Linear measurement of meters
	- Units for [[Intensity]] = [[Watt|Watts]] per square meter ($\frac {W}{m^2}$)
	- [[Watt]] = [[Joule]] per second ($\frac {J}{sec}$)
		- [[Joule]] = [[Newton]] meter
