	- Linear
		- Distance
		- Speed(velocity)
		- Acceleration
	- Angular(rotational)
		- Distance
		- Velocity
		- Acceleration
	- [[Moment of Inertia]]
		- Mass equivalent in rotational motion
	- [[Angular Momentum]]
		- Rotational sense
	- Motion
		- Linear motion: F = ma
			- Force
			- mass
			- linear acceleration
		- Rotational motion: $\tau = I \alpha$ 
			- Torque
			- moment of inertia
			- angular acceleration
	- [[Torque]]
		- $\tau = F * d$
			- Force times the perpendicular distance from the line of action of the force to the point of rotation
		- $\overset \rightarrow \tau = \overset \rightarrow r \times \overset \rightarrow F$ (in terms of vectors, would use the right-hand rule - torque will be perpendicular to the plane in which the force is acting)
			- Torque is equal to the cross product of the point to where the force is acting times the force
				- also called the [[moment arm]]
	- Rotational motion sometimes called angular motion
