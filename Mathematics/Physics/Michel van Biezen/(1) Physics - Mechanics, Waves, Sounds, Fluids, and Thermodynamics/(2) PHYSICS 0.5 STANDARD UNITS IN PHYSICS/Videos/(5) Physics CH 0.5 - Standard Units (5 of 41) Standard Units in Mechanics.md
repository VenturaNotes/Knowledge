	- Description
		- Brackets used intentionally to indicate units
	- [[Area]] = Length $\times$ Length = $m^2$ 
	- [[Volume]] = $m^3$ 
	- [[Force]] = N = 
	- [[Pressure]]
		- Measured in pascals
	- [[Work]] = [[Energy]]
	- [[Power]] = [[work]] over [[time]]
	- [[Momentum]] = [[mass]] $\times$ [[velocity]]
	- [[Impulse]] = [[force]] $\times$ [[time]]
		- Can be defined as the change of momentum (therefore, they have the same units)
	- Notice how everything can be broken down into mass, length, and time
		- With magnetism, will be some changes we need to adapt to.
