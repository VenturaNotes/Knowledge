	- Whenever heat travels through a medium such as a metal bar or concrete or brick or glass, we use the equation
		- $\frac {dQ}{dt} = kA \frac {\Delta T}{L}$
			- The amount of heat per unit time passing through is equal to the conductivity constant of the material multiplied by the cross-sectional area of the material multiplied by the difference in temperature on both sides of the material divided by the path length L
				- k = conductivity constant of material
				- A = cross-sectional area of material
				- $\Delta T$ = difference in temperature on both sides of material
				- L = path length
		- joules per second is the amount of heat per unit time
