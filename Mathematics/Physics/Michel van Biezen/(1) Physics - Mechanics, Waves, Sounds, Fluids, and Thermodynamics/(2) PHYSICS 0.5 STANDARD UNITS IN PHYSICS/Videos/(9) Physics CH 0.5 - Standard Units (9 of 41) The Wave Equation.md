	- $v = \sqrt\frac{T}{\mu}$
		- [[velocity]] of a wave on a string that has a certain [[tension]] "T" and a certain mass per unit length $\mu$ 
		- T = Tension (force)
		- $\mu$ = $\frac {m}{L}$
	- $y(x_1t) = Acos(kx-wt)$
		- y is a function x and t is equal to the amplitude of the oscillation times the cosine (or sine, just depends on the initial conditions) of the angle $(kx - wt)$ 
			- kx minus omega t
		- k is known as the [[wavenumber]]
			- where $k = \frac {2\pi}{\lambda}$
				- $\lambda$ is the [[wavelength]]
		- $\omega = 2\pi f$ 
			- $f$ = [[frequency of oscillation]]
	- Wave length is the distance between two crests on the wave
	- Position of x is in the direction to the right
		- x is distance in horizontal direction which is units of meters as well
	- y is the displacement away from equilibrium for any point on the string
	- v is the velocity of the wave
	- A is the maximum [[amplitude]] so "y" could be anywhere along the path
		- $+A$ or $-A$ 
	- Primarily concerned about the units.
		- A is the amplitude which has units of meters multiplied by the cosine of the angle
	- $kx$ does not have units
	- $wt$
		- frequency has units of $\frac {1}{sec}$
		- Has no units
	- When taking the cosine, it needs to be in radians. That is why $kx$ and $wt$ both have no units
	- In [[wave equation]], we have meters = meters
		- Displacement in meters = displacement in meters
	- [[Velocity]] has the units of meters / second
