	- 3 main units used for [[heat]] or to describe heat or the energy related to heat
		- [[calories]]
			- Readily used in laboratory and chemistry labs
			- Can use kcal ([[kilocalories]]) to express energy in foods
		- [[joules]]
			- Metric equivalent for the unit used for heat
		- [[British thermal unit]]
			- 1 BTU = 778 ft `lb` = 252 cal = 1055 J = heat (energy) required to raise the temperature of 1 `lb` of water from 63$\degree$F to $64\degree$F
				- 778 `ft-lb`
					- The energy contained in 1 BTU allows us to lift 778 pounds 1 foot off the ground
	- 1 cal = 4.186 J
	- 1 kcal = 4186 J = 1 food calorie
	- 1 cal = heat (energy) required to raise the temperature of 1g of water form $14.5\degree C$ to $15.5\degree C$
		- The [[specific heat]] of water is not exactly the same for every temperature of the water
