	- Let's define the unit of force
	- 1 [[Newton]] (N) = Force that gives the mass of 1kg the acceleration of $\frac {1m}{sec^2}$
		- In imperial system, it's called a pound
	- [[Weight]] = Force of gravity = the force by which the earth pulls on objects
		- Since the acceleration due to gravity = g = 9.8m/sec^2
		- weight = w = mg = m(9.8m/sec^2)
	- m $\ne$ w
		- [[Mass]] = a measure of the amount of matter (atoms)
			- More precisely, the amount of nucleons in each of the atoms (because that's where the mass really comes from)
			- Mass is independent of where you're at
	- m $\ne$ mg
		- [[Weight]] = A measure of the earth's gravitational pull on objects
