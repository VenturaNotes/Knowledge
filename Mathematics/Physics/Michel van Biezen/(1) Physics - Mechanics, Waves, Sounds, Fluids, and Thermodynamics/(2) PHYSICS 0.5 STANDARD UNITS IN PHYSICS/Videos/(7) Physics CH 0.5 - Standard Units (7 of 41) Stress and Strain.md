	- [[Young's Modulus]]
		- $Y = \frac {\text{stress}}{\text{strain}} = \frac{\frac FA}{\frac{\Delta L}{L}}$
			- Numerator is force divided by area
				- Newtons divided by cross-sectional area of object which is $m^2$ 
					- 
			- [[Stress]]
				- Units of pressure are also the units of stress
					- Force divided by area can be considered [[pressure]] or stress when talking about Modulus
					- $\frac {kg}{sec^2m}$ are the units of pressure
			- [[Strain]]
				- Units nonexistent (cancels out)
		- Typically for a linear object
	- [[Bulk Modulus]]
		- $B = \frac {\text{stress}}{\text{strain}} = \frac{\frac FA}{\frac{\Delta V}{V}}$
			- For Volume
			- Stress
			- Strain
				- Units nonexistent (cancels out)
	- [[Shear Modulus]]
		- $Y = \frac {\text{stress}}{\text{strain}} = \frac{\frac FA}{\frac{x}{h}}$
			- Stress
			- Strain
				- Also non-units because X is linear and h is linear
		- When trying to shear something out the way or push something on the side
	- These are used to establish the amount of strain an object will go through. Deformation strain and deformation can be used synonymous. When you apply a certain amount of force
