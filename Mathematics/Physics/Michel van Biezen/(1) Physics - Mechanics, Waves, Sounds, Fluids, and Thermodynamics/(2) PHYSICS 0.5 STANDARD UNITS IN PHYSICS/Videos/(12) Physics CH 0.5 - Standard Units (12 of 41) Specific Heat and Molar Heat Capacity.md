	- [[Specific Heat]]
		- $c_{H_2O}$ = 4189 $\frac {J}{kg*K}$ 
			- This represents the specific heat of water
			- Means to raise the temperature of 1kg of water by 1$\degree$K which is the same as $1\degree C$, it will require 4189 Joules
	- [[Molar Mass]]
		- $M_{H_2O} = 0.0180 \frac {kg}{mol}$
			- Molar mass of water 
		- The molar mass is the mass of a mol
	- [[Molar Heat Capacity]]
		- This is the product of the specific heat multiplied by the molar mass
		- $C_{H_2O} = 75.4 \frac {J}{Mol K}$
			- Will use a large capital letter C
				- If you want to raise 1 mol of water by 1 degree kelvin, it will require 75.4 J
