	- Number of school teachers grades 1-12?
	- Total population is around 300 million
		- $\frac 16$ of people are in these grades which puts you at around 50,000,000 students
		- Average class size is 25
			- So $\frac {1}{25}$ $\to$ 2,000,000 is a really good rough order estimate as to the number of teachers in the classroom.
	- This is useful for exams where you make a very rough estimation based on what you know to check if your answer is correct.
