	- The area is equal to the nominal value of 355$cm^2$ +- 20$cm^2$ 
		- The nominal value is 355$cm^2$ 
		- Just take the largest difference (19$cm^2$ or 20$cm^2$) and you'd get 20$cm^2$
	- Calculate the nominal value and then calculate the high and low possibilities. The difference will then be used in final result.
