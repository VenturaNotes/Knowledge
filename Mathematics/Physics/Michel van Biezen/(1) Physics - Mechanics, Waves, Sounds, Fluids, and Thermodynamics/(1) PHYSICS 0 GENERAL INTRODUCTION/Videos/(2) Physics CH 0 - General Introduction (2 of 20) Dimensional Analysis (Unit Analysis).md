	- We can see dimensionally that the Force equation is correct because the resulting units are equivalent to newtons (same as 6N)
	- Dimensional analysis is when we check if both sides of the equation sign have the same units to check for validity
	- Units
		- Acceleration (a) = $\frac {m}{s^2}$ 
			- \[$\frac {m}{s^2}$\]: Putting it inside brackets will indicate that it's simply units 
		- Velocity (v) = $\frac ms$ 
		- Radius for a circle (R) = m
			- Units of length
		- Mass (m) = kg
		- Acceleration of gravity (g) = $\frac {m}{s^2}$
		- Height (h) = m
			- Unit of length
		- $\overset ?=$ 
			- Placing a question mark to show that we don't know if 2 equations are equal
		- Initial velocity (v) = $\frac ms$ 
		- time (t) = s or sec
		- Equation used for a pendulum
			- Period (T) = s
			- Length of pendulum (l) = m
			- acceleration due to gravity where the pendulum is located (g) = $\frac {m}{s^2}$ 
			- 2$\pi$ is a constant (it does not have units) 
	- Getting rid of $\surd$ will make equation correct for second problem
	- For the problem $v = v_0 + at^2$, the correct formula is $v = v_0 + at$ because each term <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">needs</mark> to be equal. That is: $[\frac ms] = [\frac ms] + [\frac ms]$. This would be dimensionally correct
	- Dimensionally Correct vs Dimensionally not correct
		- Can help us notice if we have the correct equation or not
