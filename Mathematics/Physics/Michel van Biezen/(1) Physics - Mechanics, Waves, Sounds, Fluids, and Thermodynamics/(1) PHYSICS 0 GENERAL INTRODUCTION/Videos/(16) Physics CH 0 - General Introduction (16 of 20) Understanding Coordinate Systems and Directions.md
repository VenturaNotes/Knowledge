	- X-axis
		- Right is positive
		- Left is negative
	- Y-axis
		- Up is Positive
		- Down is Negative
	- Fluid Dynamics (exception)
		- In fluids when you go down, the number is typically positive. When you go up, the number is negative. The deeper you go in the fluid, the greater the pressure. The more fluid is on top of you. Therefore, they say that downwards is a positive direction.
	- A vector will have an "x" and "y" component.
	- If a vector is pointing up-right, then the x and y components will be positive.
	- If a car is moving to the right and slowing down, acceleration would be negative because it's pointing in the direction where the car is slowing down which is to the left.
	- When dropping a ball, the velocity will be -15m/sec because downwards is a negative direction.
		- The acceleration will be equal to the acceleration of gravity. Since the direction is downward, it's negative ($-9.8m/s^2$)
