	- First find the percent of the uncertainties compared to the nominal number
	- Then add the percent uncertainties together
	- Need to change 25$cm^2$ to 30$cm^2$ because the original uncertainty only has 1 significant figure.
	- The last line is wrong. The $(3 \times 10^2)cm^2$ should be  $(3 \times 10^1)cm^2$
