	- Rule for addition and subtraction: 
		- Take the number with the least number of decimal places and that should be the number of decimal places in the answer.
		- Need to round up for first problem because 56 is greater than 50
	- Rule for multiplication and division and radicals:
		- The number with the least number of significant figures will be the number of significant figures in the final answer
		- For problem 3
			- The 1 in front makes it difficult to give appreciation to the fact that 56 is a much bigger number than 14 and by using the 1 as a significant figure, it kind of skews your ability to give the correct significance to the answer
				- $1.4 \times 10^3$ and $1.36 \times 10^3$ are both considered correct (although the first one might be more correct in a classroom?)
	- Make sure to round to the nearest decimal or significant figure
		- Should not introduce accuracy that didn't exist in the first place
	- Answer for 4th question should be "620.". Seems like the professor forgot the period. [[(3) Physics CH 0 - General Introduction (3 of 20) How to Determine Significant Figures#^80a260|Period is used to indicate significance]]
