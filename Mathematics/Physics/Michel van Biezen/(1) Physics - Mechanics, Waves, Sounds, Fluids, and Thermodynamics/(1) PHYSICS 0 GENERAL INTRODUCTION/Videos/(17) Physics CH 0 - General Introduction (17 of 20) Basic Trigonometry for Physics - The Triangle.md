	- The side across the right angle of a triangle is the hypotenuse (h)
	- The 2 other angles of a triangle always add up to 90$\degree$. 
		- We can call one angle theta ($\theta$)
		- We can call another angle Phi ($\phi$ )
		- Sum of theta + phi = 90$\degree$ 
		- You can call them any greek alphabet letter that you like
	- When given a vector or direction, there will always be an x and y component to the vector.
		- The x component of the velocity can be found by multiplying the hypotenuse (velocity) by the cosine of the angle
		- $v_x = vcos\theta$ 
		- $v_y = vsin\theta$ 
		- The formulas above are not always true. It depends what the direction of the angle is.
	- We need to always realize which is the opposite side and which is the adjacent side.
	- When finding "a" in the first triangle, it is equal to $hcos\theta$ because a is adjacent to $\theta$ 
	- $a=hsin\phi$ because $\phi$ is opposite of a.

			- The side PQ, which is opposite to the right angle PRQ is called the hypotenuse. The hypotenuse is the longest side of the right triangle.
			- The side RQ is called the adjacent side of the angle $\theta$ 
			- The side PR is called the opposite side of angle $\theta$ 
	- Need to check whether the side we're looking for is adjacent or opposite of the angle
		- That is the determining factor whether you pick the sin or cos

			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Adjacent</mark>: a = hcos$\theta$
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Opposite</mark>: a = hsin$\phi$

		- SOH
			- $sin\theta = \frac {Opposite}{Hypotenuse}$ 
		- CAH
			- $cos\theta = \frac {Adjacent}{Hypotenuse}$ 
		- TOA
			- $tan\theta = \frac {Opposite}{Adjacent}$
