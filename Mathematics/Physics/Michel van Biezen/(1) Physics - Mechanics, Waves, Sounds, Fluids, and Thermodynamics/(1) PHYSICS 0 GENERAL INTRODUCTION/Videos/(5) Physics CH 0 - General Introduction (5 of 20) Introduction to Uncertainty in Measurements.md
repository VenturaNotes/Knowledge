	- Numbers derived are usually measurements
	- Need to talk about how accurately we can take those measurements
	- There will always be some uncertainty in the value that we write down
		- But Uncertainty $\neq$ Error
			- An error is when you make a mistake. You thought you read 50 but it was actually 60
	- A meter stick can have the smallest graduation down to the nearest millimeter. Whatever the smallest graduation is on the scale, they will then say the uncertainty is +- that smallest graduation.
	- When measuring an object with a ruler, you could write down the answer as 54.6cm +- 0.1cm.
		- How do you know that you're looking at it at a right angle. When you have a slight deviation from the angle that you look at, the number could easily change to 54.8 or 54.2 depending on how you look at it. 
		- The lighting conditions can be pretty bad and therefore you can't really tell carefully (because of shadows). 
		- It could be that my eyesight isn't good. So not sure which line it is
		- Could be you just don't have a lot of experience using the tool (meter stick is a simple tool though that most people are familiar with using). However, there are other apparatuses
			- (apparati is the hypercorrect form which just means it's the non-standard use of language that results from the over-application of a perceived rule of language-usage prescription [^1] [^2]) 
				- that you may not be familiar with so you might not do it correctly
		- Also that people ignore, you may have an uncertainty in exact lining of the end of the ruler with the end of the object. There could be a certain amount of uncertainty there in which you would have to add this uncertainty with the other uncertainty (measuring point) (and all the other factors that come into play)
	- Under the correct circumstances, the best you can do is to the nearest half a centimeter.
	- If the uncertainty is 0.5cm, you don't want to go too accurately on the last decimal place past the centimeter of what you're measuring. 
		- Don't want to do 54.49cm +- 0.5cm. You want to line up the decimal places. This tells us that the measurement is somewhere between \[54.0cm - 55.0cm\]. I am almost 100% sure that the measurement is somewhere between those points. Range indicates the certainty we have that it is somewhere between those 2 values
	- When measuring the diameter of a circle, here are other reasons for uncertainty. When taking a measuring apparatus such as a ruler
		- We have uncertainty where exactly we'll line it up against an edge
		- Then we are not sure if we're holding it just right (angle). Are we measuring it at its widest (as the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">diameter</mark>?) or are we cutting the line a bit so that we're actually measuring something smaller than it actually is.
			- It may be difficult to find where exactly the diameter of the circle is.
		- Simply lining it up may be difficult
	- When reading a liquid inside a graduated cylinder
		- We see the meniscus at the very end. Trying to line up where the bottom is. Trying to line it up just perfectly. Could be off (a little bit above or below the line).
			- If your eyes are above or below the line, you'd be looking at the wrong marking
			- You could write V = 18.2ml but you may be unsure if you're 1 or 2 graduations above or below so you do +- 0.2ml to say the uncertainty
			- Saying the volume is between \[18.4ml - 18.0ml \]
			- You cannot be anymore accurate than that given the quality of the apparatus, your ability to read the scale, the lighting conditions, the shadow, the angles that we have (and all other uncertainties in the measurement), must indicate that it is between 2 values
	- What do you do now when you have a number or a set of numbers that you measured and now you're trying to find the volume. Trying to find the area. Trying to find the density of something using values that have uncertainties in them, we need to learn how to deal with those as well
	- Need to take into account that the numbers we're using are not absolute correct numbers. We have a certain range where we're not certain what the correct value was.
