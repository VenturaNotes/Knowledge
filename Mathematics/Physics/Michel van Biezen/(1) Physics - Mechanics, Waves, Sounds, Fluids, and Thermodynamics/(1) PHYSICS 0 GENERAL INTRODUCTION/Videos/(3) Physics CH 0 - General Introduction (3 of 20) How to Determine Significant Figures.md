	- Most of the numbers that we deal with are measure numbers
	- We can only measure a tool so accurately because of certain limitations
		- Ability to use the tool
			- Ability to line the tool up with item we're measuring
		- Quality of the tool
		- Accuracy of the tool
	- Using a measuring stick, no one can measure a table accurately to the nearest nanometer (1.263589125m)
		- Best we can do is nearest centimeter
			- 1.26m has 3 significant figures
				- It could be 2 significant figures because sometimes we ignore the ones place when the value there is 1.
		- If we have a really good tool such as a meter stick, we could get the measurement to the nearest millimeter.
			- 1.264m has 4 significant figures
				-  It could be32 significant figures because sometimes we ignore the ones place when the value there is 1. Don't use this convention though
	- For 0.00012
		- The 0s are placeholders to place the 12 in the correct place so it only has 2 significant figures
	- For 4000
		- 1 significant number because the 0s are placeholders
	- For 4000. ^80a260
		- 4 significant numbers because the 0s are not placeholders due to the decimal point.
	- $4.0 \times 10^3$ 
		- This indicates just 2 significant figures
		- Do $4.000 \times 10^3$ to show 4 significant figures
			- More practical just to write 4000 though.
	- 0.101
		- Second 0 is significant because there is a number in front of it. Therefore, 3 significant figures
