	- [[vector space]]
	- [[basis vectors]]
	- [[maps]]
		- maps have to go from the vector space to somewhere
			- So need to create another vector space
		- Maps to the range vector space which is just another vector space
	- Could represent the basis as $e_\mu$ or $f_\nu$ 
		- mu and nu are both letters
	- You can map any vector using the linearity property of the mapping. All of them are linear maps. 
		- $\langle \Lambda, A^\mu e_\mu \rangle$ 
			- Once this structure is created (which is a map and an arbitrary vector)
			- Will be written using the [[Einstein's summation convention|Einstein summation convention]]
				- $e_\mu$ is the vector basis
				- $A^\mu$ is the components of the vector
			- When expanded, addition property and scalar multiplication property will be from the W vector space
	- In order to have a map, you need a range, a destination.
		- Need to have another vector space
	- Can we have a universe with one vector space and have maps? (yes)
		- Answer to that has to do with the [[dual space]]
		- The map can go is back to the original vector space or to the bin of real numbers
			- The bin of real numbers is the map we care about
		- Map between vector space V and bin of $\mathbb{R}$
			- The bin of real numbers is a vector space of dimension 1 over the real numbers. It only has one basis vector $e_0$ or $e$
			- This is a [[one-dimensional vector space]]
				- It can be realized by using the real numbers
				- The real numbers are a one-dimensional vector space
					- Multiplication property is real number multiplication
					- Addition property is real number addition
					- Draws its scalars from the real numbers itself
					- It's called a [[realization]] of a one-dimensional vector space
	- Interested in maps now that go from $V \to \mathbb{R}$ 
		- Not trying to define anything new
- Image
	- Going to create a vector space with maps into the real numbers
		- Instead of considering a map, we consider the set of all possible maps
			- Then we're not actually inventing / creating anything new
		- The set of all possible maps is what we'd choose from if we were to create a single map
			- Not going to choose a single map
			- The set of all possible maps is called the [[dual space]]
			- If the vector space is $V$, the set of all possible maps from $V$ into the real numbers is the [[dual space]] represented as $V^*$
