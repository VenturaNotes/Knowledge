	- [[Vector components]] transform in the opposite way compared to old and new [[basis]]
	- While the basis vectors grew by a factor of 2, the vector components shrunk by a factor of 2
		- $\vec v$ is [[invariant]]
			- It looks smaller though when using the new basis vectors
	- When the [[basis]] rotates clockwise, the [[components]] rotate counterclockwise
	- Whatever the basis does, the components do the opposite
		- Let's try to prove this idea in any dimension
	- We have 2 ways of writing $\vec v$
		- Can write it as a linear combination of the old basis vectors (with coefficients being old components)
		- Could write it as a linear combination of the new basis vectors (with coefficients being new components)

	- Better understanding of vectors

	- Proved that when moving from old components to new components, we use the backwards transformation
		- Same in other direction
	- The formulas sum up everything we've learned so far
		- We know how the basis vectors transform and how the vector components transform
	- Because vector components behave contrary to the basis vectors, we say that vector components are [[contravariant]]
		- Vectors are [[contravariant tensors]]
	- Since the vector components are contravariant, we'll make a small change in the way we write them inside the summation
		- Instead of writing the indices below like $v_i$, we write them above like $v^i$. 
		- This reminds us that the components are contravariant
			- Exponents pop up so rarely when dealing with tensors that we can basically always assume that they're vector indices and never exponents
	- Next video will talk about [[covector|covectors]] which are another example of a tensor
