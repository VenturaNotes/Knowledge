	- [[Indicial notation]] - [[Kronecker delta]]
		- Will come across [[permutation symbol]] a lot
	- [[Kronecker delta]]
		- It's a $\delta_{ij}$ with 2 indices
			- It's almost always 0 when $i \ne 0$ and only 1 when $i = j$ 
		- Only the elements on the diagonal are 1 and the others are 0
	- $\delta_{1m}a_m$ 
		- Picks out the first component of a
	- [[Orthonormal basis]]
	- $\textbf {e}_i * \textbf{e}_j$ is taking the inner products
		- Will get normalized when i = j which will equal 1
		- Will equal 0 if i $\ne$ j
	- Very useful identity
		- $\textbf {e}_i * \textbf{e}_j = \delta_{ij}$
