	- [[Indicial notation]]
		- Helps simplify long expressions with [[vectors]] and [[matrices]]
	- Have come up with notation to write it a bit shorter (using sigma)
	- [[Einstein's summation convention]]
		- Only works if the index you're summing over occurs exactly twice
		- $s = a_ix_i = a_kx_k$ 
			- Index occurring twice implicitly means we have to sum over it from one to n
			- You have an "i" that implicitly means that we have to sum over it from 1 to n
		- (take sum over twicely repeated indices)
		- Physics: n = 3 $\to$ $a_ix_i$ = $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + a_3x_3$ 
			- Often have that $a_ix_i$ means index occurs
			- Need to sum over it from 1 to 3 
		- 
	- In $\Sigma_{i,j = 1}^3 a_ib_ic_id_j$ 
		- There are three variables that have i as the subscript and one variable with j as the subscript
		- Not allowed to use summation convention here
		- Must leave it as it is
