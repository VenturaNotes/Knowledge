	- Indicial notation - [[free indices]]
	- [[Indicial notation]]
		- Allows us to abbreviate sums which shortens the expressions
		- Can also reduce the number of equations we need
			- To do this, we need [[free indices]]
	- Take for example the [[differential equations]]
	- Example 1: components of a vector
	- For the vector a
		- Can write $a_ie_i$ 
			- $a_i$ ith component multiplied by $e_i$ at ith units vector
	- Indices need to balance
	- Correct or not?
		- $a_i + k_i = c_i$
			- YES
		- $a_i + c_jd_j = f_i$
			- NO
		- $a_i + b_ic_jd_j = f_i$ 
			- YES
				- $c_jd_j$ is just a number multiplied by $b_i$ 
		- $a_i + b_ic_id_i = f_i$
			- NO
				- Has 3 indices
	- Two free indices
