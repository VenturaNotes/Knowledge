	- The identity of a [[group]] (G, $*$) is unique
		- Our group is some binary operation $*$ on some set G
		- Will begin proof with two names for an identity element of this group
			- Let $e_1$ and $e_2$ be identities of G under $*$ 
			- To prove identity is unique, need to show that $e_1 = e_2$ 
				- This demonstrates if two elements are identities, they actually must be the same element. So the identity element is unique
		- Will do a [[direct proof]] here
		- By definition of [[identity element]], what do we know with how $e_1$ and $e_2$ combine with each other? 
			- $e_1 * e_2 = e_2$ by definition of identity
			- $e_1 * e_2 = e_1$ since $e_2$ is also an identity
			- $\therefore$ $e_1 = e_2$ by [[substitution]]
				- This proves that the identity of a group is unique $\blacksquare$ 
				- If we give two different names to identities of a group, we've shown that those two names are referring to the same element. The unique identity of the group
