	- [[Rotation]]
		- Rotations are done counterclockwise in math
			- $90\degree$ in counterclockwise direction
		- Turning it $90\degree$ clockwise is the same thing as turning it $270 \degree$ counterclockwise
		- Will call the 4 moves ($0\degree$, $90\degree$, $180\degree$, $270\degree$ rotations)
			- Will label them by degrees that we rotated through in a counterclockwise direction
		- Notation
			- $R_0$, $R_{90}$, $R_{180}$, $R_{270}$
	- [[Reflection]]
		- Line V is when you reflect it across a vertical line
		- Line H is when you reflect it across the horizontal line
		- Line D' is reflecting around the off diagonal
		- Line D is reflecting across main diagonal
	- [[Combinatorics]]
		- Red has to end up at one of the corners (4 places it could end up)
			- Blue needs to be at opposite corner
		- Green and black will always be across from each other
		- Therefore, if we know where the red and green are, we know exactly where it's placed
			- For each of the 4 places where red can end up, there are 2 places where the green can end up
				- $4*2$ = 8 different final places
		- An $R_{90}$ then V $\to$ D'
