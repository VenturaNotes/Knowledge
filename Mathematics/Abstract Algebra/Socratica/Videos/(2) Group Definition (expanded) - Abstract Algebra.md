	- Many different areas of [[mathematics]]. Geometry, number theory, topology, algebra
		- Problems in these fields very different from one another.
		- In late 1800s, people noticed they were using the same tool to solve many different kinds of problems. 
		- New subject created called Abstract Algebra
			- Structure called [[Group]]
	- Clock Arithmetic is also known as [[modular arithmetic]]
		- In the example, we have 7 hours, so we call them integers mod 7
		- mod is short for [[modular]]
	- Given an [[equilateral triangle]]
		- Question: How many ways can you rotate / flip the triangle so it looks the same before & after?
			- Transformation 1 is leaving triangle unchanged
		- $r^2$ means two rotations
		- $r^3$ = 1
		- Rotations is "r" and flip about vertical axis called "f"
		- For any transformation T, $1*T = T$ and $T*1 = T$  
			- You can multiply any two transformations by first applying one, then the other
		- These transformations are called symmetries
			- There is a close relationship between symmetries of a shape and clock arithmetic
	- [[Integers]]: $\mathbb{Z}$ = {..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
		- Let x, y be integers
		- Operations: x + y, x - y are integers
			- Subtraction is adding negatives
			- e.g. 7 - 11 = 7 + (-11)
		- Single operation: +
		- [[Closure]]: x, y integers $\implies$ x + y is an integer
			- [[Closed under addition]]
		- e.g. 3 and 5 are integers, but $\frac 35$ is not an integer
		- Not closed under $\div$ 
			- May get a number outside the set of integers
		- Zero: Adding zero to any integer will give the same integer
			- x + 0 = 0 + x = x

	- Example
		- Clock arithmetic = modular arithmetic
		- Symmetries of a Triangle
		- Integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under addition (+)
	- Each example has a set of objects which we call elements
	- The 6 geometric transformations (which we also call symmetries) make up the triangle's set
	- What the examples all have in common
		- [[members|elements]]
			- Set of objects
		- [[operation]]
			- A way to combine any two elements to get another element in the set
			- We use a symbol to show we're combining two elements
			- Addition used for clock arithmetic as well as integers
				- For clock arithmetic, subtraction is redundant as it can be rewritten with addition
					- Any subtraction problem can be rewritten as an addition problem
					- On a 7 hour clock: 2 - 4 = 2 + 3 = 5
			- For symmetries of a triangle, common to use multiplication symbol $\times$ 
		- [[Closure]]
			- Each of the 3 sets are closed under the operation
				- For a, b in set, a+b also in set. ($a*b$ in set for multiplication)
		- [[Identity]] element
			- This is an element that has no effect when combined with other elements
				- For integers mod 7, it's 0 (x + 0 = 0 + x = x)
				- For triangle, it's transformation 1 (picking up triangle and dropping it unchanged)
					- $(1*y = y*1 = y)$ 
				- For integers, identity of an element is also zero
					- z + 0 = 0 + z = z
		- [[Inverse]]
			- For integers
				- Inverse of 3 is -3
				- If adding element and it's inverse, you get zero, the identity element
			- For symmetries
				- Each transformation has an opposite
					- opposite of $r$ is $r^2$ because $r*r^2$ = $r^3$ which returns the identity element 1
			- For integers mod 7, the inverse of 3 is 4 because -3 on clock is 4
				- 3 + 4 = 0 (mod 7)
			- If using + sign for operation, inverse written as -x for (x $\to$ -x)
				- If using multiplication sign, the inverse is written as $x^{-1}$ as shown $(x \to x^{-1})$
				- Combining x with inverse gives identity element
		- [[Associative Property]]
			- When combining 3 elements, it doesn't matter how you group them. Could start with combining the first two elements or the last two elements

	- [[Group]] definition
		- Set of elements G
		- Operation (allows you to combine any two elements)
			- + or $\times$ 
			- Will use an $*$ when speaking generally
		- Closed under operation
			- When combining any two elements in the group, you get another element in the group
			- $x, y \in G \implies x*y \in G$
		- Inverses: $x^{-1}$ exists for all x
			- Has opposite effect of x
			- When combining x and inverse, you get identity element which we'll call "e"
			- $x*x^{-1}=e$
		- Identity: $y*e = e*y = y$
			- Combining any element y with identity element e, we get y
		- Associativity
			- $(a*b)*c=a*(b*c)$
	- Took mathematicians many years to identify these as most essential properties
	- G may not be commutative
		- Possible for $x*y \ne y*x$ 
		- For triangle: $r*f \ne f*r$ 
	- If G is commutative, called
		- [[Commutative group]] or abelian group
	- If G is not commutative
		- [[Noncommutative group]]
