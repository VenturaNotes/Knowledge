	- [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] wrote a classic book called [[Disquisitiones Arithmeticae]]
		- Laid out [[modular arithmetic]]
			- Takes a group of integers, partitions them into a finite number of sets and then treats each set as a new type of number
			- Useful in [[group theory]]
				- Can be used in [[normal subgroups]] and [[quotient groups]]

	- Motivating Example
		- If you pick any number with a remainder of 1, and add it to any number with a remainder of 2, you will always get an integer with a remainder of 3
		- Adding a number from the 2 set to the 4 set will get you something in the one set
		- If you pick any number from one set and add it to any number from a second set, the sum will always be in the same third set
	- [[Congruence classes]]
		- It's good practice to check that these 5 meta-numbers do indeed form a group under addition
	- The set of the multiples of 5 act as the [[identity element]]
		- Each set has an inverse
	- Congruence classes
		- a, b in same congruence class
			- a $\equiv$ b (mod n)
				- "a is congruent to b mod n"
				- It just means a and b have the same remainder when you divide by n
	- For Integers mod 5
		- [[Group]]: Integers $\mathbb{Z}$ under +
			- Integers under addition
		- It has an infinite number of [[subgroup|subgroups]]
			- We will look at subgroup of multiples of 5 (which we'll write as $5\mathbb{Z}$)
				- $1 + 5\mathbb{Z}$ is known as the [[cosets|coset]] and it's not a subgroup
					- Not closed under addition
					- No inverses
					- Does not contain identity element
				- Every number in the coset has a remainder of 1 when dividing by 5
			- You can think of the subgroup $5 \mathbb{Z}$ as a coset $0 + 5 \mathbb{Z}$

	- [[quotient groups|quotient group]]
		- We use the subgroup $5\mathbb{Z}$ to partition the group $\mathbb{Z}$ into cosets
		- Because the cosets form a group, we call $5\mathbb{Z}$ a [[normal subgroup]]
		- The group of cosets is called a quotient group
			- It's written like $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$ 
				- Using subgroup to divide the group into cosets
				- When you divide one thing by another, you get a quotient
		- Critical insight of this process was the observation that you can treat the cosets as elements in a new group, a coset group if you will
	- Adding cosets
	- Important Note
		- Group: $\mathbb{Z}$
		- Normal Subgroup: $5\mathbb{Z}$
		- Quotient Group: $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z}$
		- $\mathbb{Z}/5\mathbb{Z} \le \mathbb{Z}$ 
			- Quotient group not a subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}$
	- Generalize
		- Group: G, $\cdot$ 
			- [[Multiplicative Notation]] for group G
		- Subgroup: N
			- The other cosets are simply sets
		- Use N to make cosets
			- They are non-overlapping cosets
		- Do the cosets always form a group?
			- No
				- If the cosets do not form a group, we do not call N a normal subgroup and we cannot make a quotient group

	- Lets assume n divides G into t different cosets
		- Since G may not be abelian $\to$ left cosets may differ from right cosets

	- Recap
		- $N \le G$ & Cosets form a group $\implies$ $y^{-1}Ny=N$ for any y $\in$ G
			- The converse is also true
	- Claim: The cosets form a group
	- Let N $\le$ G
		- Cosets form a group $\iff$ $y^{-1}Ny=N$ for any y $\in$ G
		- N is a [[normal subgroup]] of G
		- Notation: N $\trianglelefteq$ G
	- Coset group called "[[Factor Group]]"
		- Notation: $G/N$
		- Identity: N
		- Inverse of $x*N$ is $x^{-1}*N$

	- Simple Groups
		- Every group G has (at least) 2 subgroups
			- Identity element {e}
			- and entire group G
		- These are technically normal subgroups (but not interesting)
		- Definition: If the only normal subgroups of G are {e} and G, then G is a [[simple group]]
			- A simple group does not have any factor groups. Are building blocks of other groups (much like prime numbers are building blocks of the integers)
	- Applications
		- Normal subgroups and quotient groups are among the most useful devices in abstract algebra
		- [[Homomorphisms]] from G
			- f: G $\to$ H
		- In separate groups, will determine what kinds of homomorphisms are possible from a group G to other groups.
		- For finite groups, you can find a chain of normal subgroups called a "[[composition series]]" which acts as a prime factorization of the group.
		- Normal subgroups can even be used to study fields: you'll learn this technique in [[Galois Theory]]
			- [[Field Extensions]]
				- $K / F$
	- Exercise
		- Try to find a normal subgroup of the [[symmetric group]] $S_3$ 
			- This group only has 6 elements so you should be able to check everything by hand
