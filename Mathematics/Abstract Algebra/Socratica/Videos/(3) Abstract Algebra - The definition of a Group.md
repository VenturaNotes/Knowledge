	- The definition of a [[Group]]
		- It's an abstract idea
	- In [[arithmetic]], we learn to add, subtract, multiply, and divide numbers
		- Integers $\mathbb{Z}$
		- Fractions $\mathbb{Q}$
		- Real Numbers $\mathbb{R}$
		- Complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$ 
	- Subtraction is addition in disguise. Division is multiplication in disguise
	- In arithmetic
		- Operations: addition and multiplication
		- [[Opposites]]:
			- For addition, it's negative numbers
			- For multiplication, it's reciprocals
			- Use the word [[inverse]] instead of opposite for abstract algebra
		- If you combine a number with its inverse, you get an [[identity]] element
			- For addition it's 0
				- Adding any number by 0 will not change it
			- For multiplication it's 1
				- Multiplying any number by 1 will not change it
	- [[Group]]
		- Set of elements
		- Operation: $*$
		- Closed under $*$
		- Inverses
		- Identity: e
		- Associativity
			- Without this, could not solve simplest of equations
	- Commutative groups are called commutative groups or Abelian Groups
