	- Learned [[Multiplication table]] when studying arithmetic
	- Groups behave very differently than numbers in arithmetic
	- [[Group Multiplication Tables]]
		- aka "Cayley Tables"
			- In honor of [[Arthur Cayley]] (1821 - 1895)
				- He was the first to use them in a math paper
	- Group under multiplication consisting of 4 elements
		- Group: $\times$, {1, -1, i, -i}
	- Features of Cayley Tables
		- First row / column match headers if headers start with identity
		- Every row / column contains identity element because in groups, all elements have inverses
		- Table is symmetric about diagonal. Flipping group along diagonal gives same table
			- This is because a group is [[Commutative group|abelian]]: $a\times b = b \times a$ for any two elements a and b
		- [[Noncommutative group|Non-abelian groups]] are not symmetric about diagonal
		- No duplicate elements in rows & columns (not counting headers)

	- Assume there's a row with duplicate elements
		- We find that x = y but they're different
		- Therefore we have a contradiction
		- $\therefore$ Rows cannot have duplicate elements
	- Can use same reasoning to show that columns cannot have duplicate elements
	- Groups G of order 1
		- "[[Order]]" = # of elements in group
		- |G| = Order of G
	- Every group must have [[identity element]]
		- Could use e
		- [[Trivial group]]
	- Groups of order 2
		- Rule: Each row & column contains all elements. No duplicates in any row or column
		- Same as Integers mod 2
			- $\mathbb{Z} / 2\mathbb{Z}$ 
	- Groups of order 3
		- There is only one group of order 3

	- Group of order 3 (Cayley table)
		- Symmetric about diagonal (abelian group)
		- Identical to integers mod 3 under +
		- They are [[isomorphic groups]]
	- Almost like solving a sudoku puzzle
	- Challenge
		- Find all groups of order 4
		- Clues:
			- 4 Cayley tables
			- 3 are identical
			- 2 distinct groups
