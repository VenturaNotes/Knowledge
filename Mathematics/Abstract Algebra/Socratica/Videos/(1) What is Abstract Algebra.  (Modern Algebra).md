	- In the year 1800, people knew how to solve linear equations, quadratic equations, cubic equations and quartic equations
		- What about higher degrees?
			- [[Evariste Galois]] answered this question
				- Used a tool called a [[group]]
		- [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] busy making discoveries of his own
			- Ironed out [[modular arithmetic]]
				- Helped solve many problems in [[number theory]]
		- Modular arithmetic shared similarities to groups used by Galois
	- In 1800s, saw revolution in geometry
		- [[Euclid]] dominated the scene with his book called "The Elements"
	- There are other geometries beyond the one devised by the ancient Greeks
		- Groups are a useful tool for studying these geometries
	- A group is a set G with an operation $*$ such that:
		- [[Closure]]: If x and y are in G, then x$*$y is in G
		- [[Associativity]]: For all x, y, z in G, we have $(x*y)*z = x*(y*z)$
		- [[Identity Element]]: There is an element e in G such that $e*x=x*e=x$ for all x in G
		- [[Inverse Elements]]: For each element x in G, there is an element $x^{-1}$ such that $x*x^{-1} = x^{-1}*x=e$
	- Groups are a powerful tool that can be used in many different ways. It makes sense to "abstract" out the common features of this tool used by others into a general tool. Then learn everything about it. Then, [[group theory]] was born.
	- New abstract objects began to take shape
		- [[Rings]]
		- [[Fields]]
		- [[Vector Spaces]]
		- [[Modules]]

	- The correct definition was finally identified and now called [[abstract algebra]]
		- It's a young subject
		- Usefulness continues to grow
	- In physics, chemistry, computer science and other areas are discovering how useful abstract algebra can be
		- Sometimes called modern algebra
	- Mathematical experience and mental maturity important when learning abstract algebra
