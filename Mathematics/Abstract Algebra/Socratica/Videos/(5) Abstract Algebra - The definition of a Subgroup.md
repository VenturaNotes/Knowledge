	- The definition of a [[subgroup]]
	- Group: G
	- Subgroup
		- A subgroup of G is a subset which is also a group
		- Common letter used for subgroup is H
	- For H $\le$ G
		- "H is a subgroup of G"
	- Technical Postscript
		- G $\le$ G
			- Technically G is a subgroup of itself
			- That's why we use the less than or equal to symbol
		- If H $\ne$ G $\implies$ H < G
			- H is a subgroup of G
			- Could say "H is a [[proper subgroup]] of G" since H is a [[proper subset]] of G in this case
