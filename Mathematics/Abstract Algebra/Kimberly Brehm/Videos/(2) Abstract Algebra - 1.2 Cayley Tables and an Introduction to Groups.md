- Let's recap what we have just learned about the symmetries of a square:
	- Rotations
		- 0$\degree$, $90 \degree$, $180\degree$, $270\degree$, $360 \degree$...
		- We will call these
			- $R_0$, $R_{90}$, $R_{180}$, $R_{270}$
		- though you may also see them as
			- e, r, $r^2$, $r^3$ 
	- Reflections
		- H, V, D, D'
		- Though you may also see them as 
			- $f, rf, r^2f, r^3f$
