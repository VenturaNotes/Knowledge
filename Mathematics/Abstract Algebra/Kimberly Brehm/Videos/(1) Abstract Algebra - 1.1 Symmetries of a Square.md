- Our study of groups begins by analyzing a square and the actions that can return a square back to its <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">original footprint</mark>
- Rotations:
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 10.36.57 PM.png]]
	- Rotate counterclockwise by 45$\degree$ 
		- This is not ok when rotating a square because it's not back to its original footprint
	- Rotating again counterclockwise by 45$\degree$ returns the square's original footprint (even when the vertices are different)
	- $R_{90}$
		- This is a 90 degree rotation total
- Reflections:
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 10.38.32 PM.png]]
	- V
		- Vertical axis of reflection
		- A and D switched places
		- B and C switched places

	- New points are denoted with prime symbols to show that the square has rotated counterclockwise by 90$\degree$ 
		- (This was generated in GeoGebra Classic. Important if you take modern geometry)
	- 180 degree rotation is also ok.
	- Multiples of 90 will keep the square in the same footprint
	- Rotation of nothing is the identity rotation
	- Denote rotations as $R_0, R_{90}, R_{180}, R_{270}$

	- Horizontal reflection, vertical reflection, diagonal reflection
		- Will all stay in original footprint
	- When reflecting over V (vertical)
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 10.44.24 PM.png|300]]
			- A and D switch places
			- B and C switch places
	- Reflect over H (Horizontal Line)
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 10.44.56 PM.png|300]]
			- A and B switch places
			- C and D switch places
	- Reflect over D1 (diagonal 1, just called D in textbook)
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 10.45.33 PM.png|300]]
			- B and D switch places. 
			- A and C remain don't switch
	- Reflect over D2 (This is referred to as D' in textbook)
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 10.47.06 PM.png|300]]
			- A and C switch places
			- B and D don't switch
- Composition of Actions
	- Rotate polygon 90$\degree$ counterclockwise
	- Reflect new polygon over H
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 10.49.45 PM.png|300]]
		- Here A and C haven not switched places
		- B and D have switched places
	- We've seen the same action if we reflected across the first diagonal
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-10 at 10.50.33 PM.png|300]]
	- $D_1 = HR_{90}$
		- We took $R_{90}$ first and then we did H
			- It's like composition notation f(g(x)) where we start with g(x) and then move onto f(x)
