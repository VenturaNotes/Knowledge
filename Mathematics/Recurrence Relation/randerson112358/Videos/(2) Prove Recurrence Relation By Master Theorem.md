	- Recurrence proof by master theorem
	- Prove $T(n)$ = 4T(n/2) + n $\in$ O($n^2$) by the master theorem
		- Read as the "recurrence of T(n)"
	- [[Master theorem]]
		- If T(n) = aT(n/b) + $\circleddash$($n^d$) where a > 0, b> 0, and d $\ge$ 0 then
		- $T(n) = \begin{cases} \circleddash(n^d) & \text{if } d > log_ba\\ \circleddash(n^dlogn)& \text{if } d=log_ba \\ \circleddash(n^{log_ba}) & \text{if } d < log_ba) \end{cases}$ 
			- `a` is a constant greater than 0
			- `b` is greater than 0
			- $\circleddash(n^d)$ is just seen as some function
				- The shape is theta ^vmuqxr
	- In the example $d = 1$ because the $n$ is to the power of 1
	- If you know the theta definition
		- Something is a function if it belongs to $\theta(g(n))$ if 
			- f(n) = O(g(n)) and f(n) = $\Omega$(g(n))
			- #question What significance does this have?
