	- Asymptotes + holes of rational functions
		- (1) End Behavior:
			- Horizontal asymptote
			- Oblique Asymptote
			- Power Function
		- (2) Factor
		- (3) Define Domain
		- (4) Determine any vertical asymptote +/or holes
		- (5) Simplify + evaluate for hole if necessary

	- Important to follow steps in order
	- Removable Discontinuity
	- You can cross a horizontal asymptote but this function is going to tend to that value as we approach positive and negative infinity.
		- Limit idea: as x approaches to some value, the function gets closer and closer to a value (in this case the value of the horizontal asymptote)
	- The simplified rational function looks exactly the same as the original function except potentially without the hole.

	- When simplifying a radical function, you could use synthetic division if there is a linear factor left to find the oblique asymptote if the degree of the numerator is 1 greater than the degree of the denominator
	- Oblique asymptote can be your function but only if you're missing a point
