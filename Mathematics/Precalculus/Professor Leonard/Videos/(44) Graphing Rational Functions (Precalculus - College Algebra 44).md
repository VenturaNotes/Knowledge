	- Steps for Graphing Rational Functions
		- (1) Find Horizontal/Oblique Asymptote or end behavior
		- (2) Factor + find vertical asymptote(s) +/or hole(s) w/ multiplicity
		- (3) Find x-intercepts
			- Numerator = 0
		- (4) Find y-intencept
			- Plug x = 0
		- (5) Set f(x) equal to horizontal or oblique asymptote to check for intersection (Not for y=0)
			- If you find any x-values, this means that your graph intersects the horizontal asymptote
		- (6) Make a # line w/ key points + find extra points
		- (7) Graph
	- You can use the y-intercept for an interval, but having more points is better.
	- You can intersect a horizontal asymptote.
		- This is because the graph approaches the asymptote at infinity.

	- This is alright for sketching, but could be better by doing long division of poly. and obtaining $x^2+4$ 
		- This is a shift of the parabola up 4 units.
	- You can cross end behavior

	- You can find the y-intercept using the factored form.
	- A horizontal asymptote does not have odd or even
		- You need some other points which you could do with calculus though
		- Maybe we could do it with some limits but we don't have that right now

	- Might get an untrue math statement if it doesn't cross y=2

	- We are sketching these functions. Not graphing them

	- 0 for an x-intercept means you'll have a 0 for a y-intercept
	- Not doing step 5 for this problem because it will take a long time to distribute.
		- An alternative method is to find points that would force your graph to cross

- Pretty much all that can be taught when graphing rationals in this class
