	- A function where one input gives one unique output.
	- In an inverse, we switch the x value with the y value in general for every inverse we deal with
		- Therefore, we need functions that are one-to-one so that their inverses are also functions.
	- "g" is a function but not a one-to-one function
	- Use the vertical line test and horizontal line test to figure out if it's a one-to-one function
