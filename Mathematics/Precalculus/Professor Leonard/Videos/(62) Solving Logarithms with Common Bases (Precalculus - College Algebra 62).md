	- If $log_ax = log_ay$, then x=y
		- Only if all terms are logs w/ same base
	- Inside of logarithm needs to be strictly greater than 0
	- Evaluate to make sure that the x you find does not make the argument 0 or negative

	- If you have a constant that's not a logarithm, you would use the right problem to solve for x. It works in every case while the middle problem will only work if you don't have a constant
		- Helps when you have a term that's not a logarithm
