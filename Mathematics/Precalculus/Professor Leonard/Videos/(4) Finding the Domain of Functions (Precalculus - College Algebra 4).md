	- Finding Domain
		- Domain is the set of inputs of a function that give a real number output
		- Two Problem Areas
			- Square root: $\sqrt{}$ 
				- Inside must be positive
				- Otherwise, you'd get an imaginary number
			- Denominators $\frac {}{()}$ 
				- Cannot equal zero
				- Otherwise you'd get an undefined number/value
	- We can have functions that have outputs which are imaginary numbers or complex numbers defined over the complex
	- For things we normally graph, we are going to restrict this to functions that are defined over real numbers
	- Square roots
		- Can have problems with even roots
	- Will consider logarithms as problems later
	- Square root
		- Interval of numbers of what numbers it wants to have
	- Denominators
		- Numbers it can't have (that equals 0)
	- Can write domain as set-builder notation or interval notation
	- Will get a vertical asymptote when the [[(42) Rational Functions and Graphs#^45f9bc|denominator is 0]]
		- If there is a factor that cancels with the numerator, that x value will just create a hole in the graph
			- A hole in the graph is known as [[removable discontinuity]]
	- With logarithms you want numbers that are positive
		- And base can't be 0
	- When the numerator is equal to 0, that is where the x-intercepts are
	- Factoring says to put your polynomial in order
		- The exponents in $t^3 - 16t = 0$ are descending
	- If you have $t^2$ subtracted by some real number, you can factor that

	- When you have $\frac 00$, it's factorable and cancellable, so therefore a hole
	- Vertical asymptote is created when t=4 because it causes denominator to equal 0

	- For real numbers, a domain is a set of inputs that must give us a real number output
	- If you have a logarithm, you need to set it greater than 0 (can't even equal 0)
	- Output for exponentials has to be positive

	- If function does not have square roots, denominators, or logarithms, the domain will be all real numbers for every polynomial you have
	- If you have a denominator that can never equal 0  or a square root that is always positive (such as $\frac {5}{\sqrt{x^2+1}})$, then your domain will be all real numbers. Also denominator could be a constant which would also not cause a problem.
