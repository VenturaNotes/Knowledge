	- Shows 4 different methods to solve
	- Isolate exponential
		- Use logs
	- [[Isolated Exponential]]
		- $3^{(x+1)} = \frac 58$
	- Exact solutions may not look good but they're exact
	- First type of solution has 3 different types of appropriate solutions (either log base 3, 10, or e)
	- For #2
		- You need to have the parentheses in $(x+1)log3$

	- When solving exponential equations
		- Those you can isolate on one side
		- 2 exponentials with a common base
		- 2 exponentials with no common base
	- It's possible that the solution may not look the same or be in the same format but many times when solving exponentials we get solutions that look different.

	- A range problem for an exponential will cause a domain problem for your logarithm.
	- Composing a function with its inverse where argument and base are equal will give 1
	- Right-most problem is no solution

	- Need to use substitution for this
