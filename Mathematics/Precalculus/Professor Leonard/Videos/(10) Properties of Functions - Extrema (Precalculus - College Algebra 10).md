	- No Endpoints
		- Local/Relative Maximum
			- On an open interval, f(x) $\le$ f(c) where c is a local max
			- Where function changes from increasing to decreasing
		- Local/Relative Minimum
			- f(x) $\ge$ f(c) where c is a local min
			- Where function changes from decreasing to increasing
	- Endpoints
		- Absolute Maximum
			- Highest output on graph
		- Absolute Minimum
			- Lowest output on graph
		- Note: Every closed interval (continuous) will have both Absolute maximum and absolute minimum
		- The absolute maximum value can occur at 2 different places, but still have the same y-value.
			- Same goes for absolute minimum
