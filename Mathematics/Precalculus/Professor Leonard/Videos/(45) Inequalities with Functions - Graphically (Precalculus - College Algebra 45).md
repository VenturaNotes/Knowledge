	- f(x) $\ge$ 0 f(x) $\lt$ 0
		- On what portion of the x-axis is your function above it or below it
		- What are the inputs causing the outputs to be positive or negative
	- For $f(x) \le 0: [2,4) \cup (4,6]$
		- You cannot include the 4 because when x=4, the function is undefined even if the limit does reach negative infinity which is way below 0
	- The x-axis is a number line
