	- f(x)
		- This [[function notation]] gives us more
		- This means we have a function that's dealing with the variable x
	- f(2)
		- In the function f, replace your independent variable with 2
	- f(2) = -9
		- This notation shows us both our input and output
		- If you read it left to right, it will give us the ordered pair as well.
	- f(x+1)
		- This is evaluating for other functions ([[composition]])
	- Blank Space "( )"
		- Parentheses maintain operations
		- Open cavity
		- Helps with evaluating functions, even [[composition functions]]
	- [[Even Function|Even Functions]] and [[Odd Function|Odd Functions]]
		- In h(x), if plugging in (-x) gives the exact same thing as your function, you have an even function
		- In h(x), if you plug in (-x) and it gives you every sign opposite of your function, you have an odd function
		- Otherwise, neither even or odd
	- h(x+1)
		- Works out to a different function because it's a composition of functions
	- f(0)
		- Could be starting point or endpoint of graph
	- $(2x)^2$
		- Distribution of one mathematical operator is always distributed across something below it. Just one level below it. For instance, exponents distribute across multiplication and division. Multiplication and division distribute across addition and subtraction
	- f(x + h)
		- Difference quotient
	- [[Radicand]] is inside the [[Radical|radical]]
	- What we're looking for in the domain are the numbers that we plug in that give us real numbers and defined numbers out.
	- [[Domain (Math)|Domains]]
		- Need to make sure the inside of a square root is always positive
		- Can never have an input that makes 0 the denominator
	- Domain will be all real numbers if the equation has no square roots and no denominators
	- -g(x)
		- Just means take your function and put a negative in front of it (could distribute it to numerator or denominator but not both.)

	- [[Difference quotient]]
		- You have subtraction and division
	- The function itself is an output value
		- f(x) is an output value
		- f(x+h) is an output value of whatever it happens to be
	- We're subtracting out the values and dividing by the change between x and x+h
		- Divides the change in y by the change in x
	- Gives relationship for a slope of a line
	- $\frac{f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$
		- Output 2 - Output 1 over the change between inputs
		- Represents the slope between 2 points
		- h is the distance horizontally between 2 points
	- In calculus 1, we ask what happens when the h becomes really small?
		- If you take a limit as the distance "h" approaches 0, then the formula approaches the slope of a curve at a line (an instantaneous rate of change)
	- Limit
		- A way to get closer and closer to some number in math
		- What happens if you let "h" become really close to 0?
	- Curves have slopes (instantaneous at every point. They change)
	- The point on the curve is (2,5). The slope at that point (on the instant of the curve) is 4
		- Before that point the line is shallower
		- After that point the line is steeper
	- This is why we learn the difference quotient and compositions
