	- The [[vertical line test]]
		- For functions, 1 input gives 1 output
	- For every possible input on the horizontal axis, we imagine an infinite number of vertical lines where there is never a case where a vertical line is going to have 2 outputs (touch our graph twice)
		- Where your inputs give you outputs, there is only 1. It's ok if a vertical line does not go through any outputs. It's just not part of the domain of your function.
	- Input is horizontal axis and output is vertical axis
	- Vertical line test helps with piecewise functions as well
		- Ensures we don't overlap our graphs
