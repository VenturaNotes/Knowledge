	- These functions should be memorized
	- [[(21) Toolkit Functions]]
	- Cubes maintain signs
	- Odds may have key points of (-1,-1) and evens may have key points of (-1,1)
	- You cannot touch a vertical asymptote. 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">You can cross horizontal asymptotes</mark> in some range/interval but as you get to infinity you're not going to touch them. You're going to approach them.
	- Bottom 4 graphs are odd functions
		- $x, x^3, \sqrt[3]{x},\frac1x$ 
			- All have the points (1,1) and (-1,-1)
		- $x, x^3, \sqrt[3]{x}$
			- Always increasing
			- Includes the point (0,0)
		- $\frac 1x$
			- Decreasing
			- Domain is everything except 0
			-  This can be called the reciprocal function as well
			- It's also a rational function
	- Top 3 graphs are even functions (besides $\sqrt{x}$)
		- b, $x^2$, $|x|$
		- $x^2$, $|x|$
			- Decreasing and then increasing
		- Almost all have (1,1) and (0,0) as key points
	- Constants are horizontal straight lines
	- Important to memorize key points but also (-1,-1), (0,0) and (1,1) are important points to remember
	- Key points and shapes are crucial for understanding how a function shifts and stretches
