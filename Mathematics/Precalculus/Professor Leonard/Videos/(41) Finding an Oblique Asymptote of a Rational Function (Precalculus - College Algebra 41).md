	- Oblique asymptotes of rational functions occur when
		- Degree of number is larger than degree of denominator by exactly 1
	- Notes
		- Must know long division
		- Also called "slant" asymptote
			- Diagonal line
		- Cannot have both a horizontal + oblique asymptote
	- End behavior of a rational function (only 3 cases)
		- Horizontal asymptote (0 or constant)
		- Diagonal line (oblique or slant)
		- Regular old end behavior
	- You can cross an oblique asymptote
