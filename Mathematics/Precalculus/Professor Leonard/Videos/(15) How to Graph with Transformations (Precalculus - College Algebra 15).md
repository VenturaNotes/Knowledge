	- Example 1
		- Up 2
		- Right 3
		- Vertical Compression
		- Reflection about x-axis
	- Example 2
		- Down 1
		- Left 1
		- Vertical Compression
		- Reflection about x-axis

	- Example 1
		- Has a shift up 1, a shift right 2 and a vertical stretch by a factor of 3
		- Please note that this technique also maintains both the vertical and horizontal asymptote (when finding x-intercept?)
			- Can find the y-intercept by setting x=0
		- When finding the y-intercept, set the equation equal to 0 and solve
			- Seems like there is an x-intercept because the equation was shifted up even though most of the time, you will not get an x-intercept from the denominator
	- "x" needs to be positive and first
	- Identifying basic graph shapes is important
	- Shifting horizontally is affecting the input
	- Outside the function is multiplying/stretching
	- Reflecting about the y-axis is affecting inside the input
