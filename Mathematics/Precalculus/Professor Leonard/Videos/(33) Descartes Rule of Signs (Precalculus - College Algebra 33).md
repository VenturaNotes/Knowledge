	- [[Descartes Rule of Signs]]
		- (1) Polynomial in order
		- (2) Count Sign Changes
			- Left to Right
				- This, or an even number less than this, is the amount of positive x-intercepts
		- (3) Evaluate for "-x" + repeat Step 2)
			- This, or even number less than this is the amount of negative x-intercepts
			- Pretty much just change the sign of odd powered terms
	- If you have a polynomial in order and you count the number of sign changes from left to right, it will tell you the number of positive x-intercepts you have
	- Idea comes from irreducible quadratics $x^2 + 25$ since the complex numbers come in pairs
	- For f(x) we know that there will be an irreducible quadratic because the degree of the polynomial is 7 but there can only be 5 possible x-intercepts
	- Degree gives maximum possible number of x-intercepts
		- Please keep in mind that functions can have multiples of roots (multiplicity) that can count for several x-intercepts. In other words, you can get the SAME x-intercept more than once.
	- With the [[rational zeros theorem]], if you have no negatives, that already eliminates half of the possible x-intercepts.
	- If you have an equation such as $x^{4}+x^{2}$, Descartes will say that you have no positive or negative y-intercepts. However, you do have an intercept at 0 (which is neither positive or negative)
