	- Properties
		- (1)
			- Log base a of 1 will always equal 0 
			- Log base a of a will always equal 1
			- When composing logarithm onto an exponential or an exponential onto a logarithm, you get the value of the exponent or argument of the logarithm
				- $a^{log_aM} = M$
					- $log_aM = log_aM$
						- This would create a trivial statement if you don't cancel the composition
							- You get trivial statements because you've composed a function onto its inverse
		- (2)
			- Logarithmic properties model exponential properties
			- Sum of two logarithms
			- Not a one-way street
		- (3)
			- When you have division within argument, you can separate the dividend and divisor into separate logarithms (being their own arguments) and subtracting those logarithms
			- Need to know these properties to expand and combine
		- (4)
			- exponent in argument can be moved in front of logarithm. Helps get rid of radicals in arguments.
