	- Steps
		- (1) Get all logs on one side + constant on the other
		- (2) Combine the logs
		- (3) Use an exponential (write in exponential form)
	- When solving for x, ensure there are no domain issues.
	- For $log_24$ 
		- I'm not simplifying the second log so that we can practice our combining, although it could be simplified to 2 and subtracted from 5
	- Usually not going to see constants greater than 1 or 2 since numbers would be more difficult for us to work with on a test.
	- For right-most problem
		- Distribute everything (group everything on one side)
			- Factor it
			- Quadratic formula it
			- Rational zeros theorem to find a root (if it's really difficult to factor)
	- Need to check if solutions valid

	- For left-most problem, doing the left method is better because it eliminates problems that the right method can give.
		- Make sure to simplify and factor the argument of a logarithm

	- When changing the base of a logarithm, usually choose the lowest number across all logs in the equation to try to make them the same.
	- In $2^7=x^{\frac 74}$
		- What do you need to multiply $x^{\frac 74}$ to make that 1?
			- That would be multiplying it by the reciprocal. 
	- About 3 different ways to solve the middle problem
		- Distribute the fractions into the exponents of the arguments
			- Is the recommended method
		- Get rid of all the denominators
		- Raise the exponent to the denominator for both sides
	- Needed to simplify $log_216$ because otherwise you couldn't do substitution

	- Solving logarithms without common bases.
