	- Horizontal asymptotes of rational functions occur when
		- Degree of Denominator $\ge$ Degree of Number
			- (1) Degree of Denom. > Degree of Number
				- Horizontal asymptote @ y=0
			- (2) Degree of denominator = Degree of Numerator
				- Horizontal Asymptote @ y= Fraction of Leading Coefficient
		- Notes
			- (1) You can cross a horizontal asymptote
			- (2) End behavior is determined by leading terms
	- You can never have a slant and a horizontal asymptote on the same graph
	- You can never cross a vertical asymptote but you can cross a horizontal asymptote
	- $\frac {8x^5}{2x^4}$ would given an oblique (slant) asymptote of 4x.
