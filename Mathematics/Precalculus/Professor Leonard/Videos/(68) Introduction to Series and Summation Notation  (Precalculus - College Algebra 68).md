	- Intro to series
		- How to add the terms of a sequence
	- A series adds up the terms of a sequence
	- There are some predictable formulas that we can do proof by induction
	- In Calculus 2, you can add an infinite series (infinite number of terms) and get something (it converges)
	- Interesting things happen to transcendental numbers (such as $\pi$ and e) when we view them in a series
	- $\Sigma$
		- It's a greek letter S which stands for sum
	- "k" is the index of your sequence and "n" tells you where to stop
	- Sometimes "n" is infinite (giving an infinite sequence)
	- $\Sigma_{k=0}^{n-1} (2k + 1)$ and $\Sigma_{k=1}^{n} (2k - 1)$ both represent odd numbers

	- [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]]
		- Solved the $\Sigma_{k=1}^{n} k = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ in 5th grade
	- Most of the formulas were discovered by pattern and then proved with induction (there are other ways to prove it)
	- Repeated addition is multiplication
	- You will never get a fraction as a result of the summation formulas for $k$, $k^2$ and $k^3$
	- If you have to find the summation of a series and the starting index is not 1, you can find the sum from k = 1 to 24 and then subtract k= 1 to 3 if we're just looking for values of k between 4 and 24 (bottom-right image)
