	- Intro to [[Geometric Sequence|geometric sequences]]
		- A sequence where the ratio between any two successive terms is constant (common ratio)
	- Geometric (r = -3)
	- Arithmetic (d = 7)
	- 1, 2, 4, 7, 11, 16, 22
		- Neither arithmetic n or geometric
	- All geometric sequences can be written
		- $a_n = a_1r^{n-1}$
	- Both geometric sequence equations are the same below
		- $a_n = 3^1(\frac 13)^{n-1}$
		- $a_n =(\frac 13)^{n-2}$
