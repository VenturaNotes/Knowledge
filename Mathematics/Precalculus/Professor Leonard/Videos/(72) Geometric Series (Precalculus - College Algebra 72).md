	- Intro to [[geometric series]]
		- [[Series]] takes the terms of a sequence and adds them up
		- Take [[Geometric Sequence|geometric sequence]] that's built on a geometric shape
			- $a_1r^{k-1}$ is a geometric sequence
			- Series adds it up
	- Formula for geometric series
		- $\frac {a_1}{1-r}(1-r^n)$
	- Partial sum for 1st "n" terms
	- If [[common ratio]] between -1 and 1, we can add up the terms in a series forever and get something out.
		- It will converge
