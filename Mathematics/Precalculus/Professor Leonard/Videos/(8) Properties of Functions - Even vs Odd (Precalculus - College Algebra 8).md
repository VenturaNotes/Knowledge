	- In single term functions, the power will tell you if the function is even or odd
		- In polynomials we lose that
		- Functions that don't have any exponents can be even vs odd
	- cos(x) is an even function
	- Ways to find if graph is odd
		- For the top-right graph, imagine you flip the right side across the y-axis and then across the x-axis. It will look exactly the same as the graph on the left side of the axis before the transitions.
		- You could flip the graph around 180 (look at it upside down and it needs to look the same)
	- When graphing polynomials and especially rational functions
		- even vs odd will tell us a whole lot on how they'll look
			- In a neighborhood of points, how they behave with asymptotes, x-intercepts (has to do with multiplicity which is an even vs odd idea)
	- Many graphs are neither ever nor odd.
	- [[Even]]: Symmetric about y-axis
		- f(x) = f(-x)
		- Even functions take opposite inputs and give you equal outputs
	- [[Odd]]: Symmetric about origin
		- -f(x) = f(-x)
		- Take opposite inputs and you get opposite outputs

	- The shortcut for finding if a function is even or not only works for polynomial driven functions and not trig, etc. 
		- If the exponent is odd, just evaluate it with the negative sign.
	- When opposite values are undefined (such as in radicals), then the function is neither even nor odd.
