	- Graphs of exponential Functions
		- f(x) = $a^x$
			- x is the variable
			- a is the base
				- a > 0
				- (positive constant)
				- It's not going to be 1 either?
				- Will get an increasing graph if > 1 and a decreasing graph if 0 < x < 1
	- Exponents with negative values create fractions, not negative values
	- Key Points
		- (0, 1)
		- (1, a)
	- Domain: $\mathbb{R}$
	- Range: (0, $\infty$)
	- "e" is a constant
		- known as Euler's number
		- It is the natural number
		- About 2.7
		- It is a [[(Video) Transcendental Numbers - Numberphile|transcendental number]]
	- If your base is > 1, you get something above 1. If your base is < 1, you get something less than 1. This helps when finding if a graph grows or decays.
	- Since an exponential function is 1 to 1, we know that it has an inverse.
	- Only way to solve an exponential function such as $f(x) = a^x$ is buy using a logarithm
		- Unless of course a special case arises.
