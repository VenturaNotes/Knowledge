	- Zero product property
	- Quadratic has first term positive and expression has terms with degrees in descending order
	- Factoring by grouping
		- Factor out a common factor
	- Greatest Common Factor (GCF)
	- [[(Video) Factoring Trinomials with Leading Coefficient not 1 (fast way)|Shortcut for factoring a quadratic]]
	- If you reflect something on the x-axis about the x-axis, it doesn't change parabola or x-intercepts
	- You could factor with a fraction (like $(x + \frac 32)$)
	- You can factor $x^2-5$. You just need to take the square root of the 5 and square it
		- When you are left with linear and irreducible quadratics, it is not irreducible, it has to be factored
