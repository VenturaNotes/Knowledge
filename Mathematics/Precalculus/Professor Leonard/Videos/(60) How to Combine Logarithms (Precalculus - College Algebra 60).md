	- Note how the argument, before simplification, could be changed directly to this expression. I showed this just in case you ended with the radical on the denominator and forgot how to do rationalization.
	- Usually need to rationalize the denominator
	- Every added logarithm creates a factor in the numerator and every subtracted logarithm creates a factor in the denominator.
	- To solve complex fractions, multiply by the LCD
	- Don't want to simplify $log_39$ to 2 because we want to combine all the logarithms together

	- Addition creates products and subtraction creates quotients
	- There is a way to combine radicals but it's more cumbersome than practical
