	- Even multiplicity creates a bounce
	- Odd multiplicity creates a cross
	- To show an individual value as a solution
		- Write $\{5\}$
	- Polynomials are continuous intervals.
	- Always will be the case for polynomials that it will be the same truth statement across a bouncing x-intercept
		- Not always true for rationals? (probably because you need to consider the denominators to find the asymptotes)

	- Irreducible quadratics do not cause crossings as they don't go through the x-axis.
	- Taught connection between graphing and inequalities.
