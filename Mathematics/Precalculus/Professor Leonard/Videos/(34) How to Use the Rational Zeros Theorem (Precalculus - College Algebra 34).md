	- Method
		- Find factors of the constant and leading coefficient (includes positives and negatives)
		- Make a list of all possible rationals of the constant over the leading coefficient
			- This is a list of all possible rational zeros
	- The y-intercept of $f(x) = 2x^3 + 11x^2 - 7x - 6$ is $-6$ because f(0) = -6
	- Rational means positive or negative whole numbers or fractions
	- Check for every combination / permutation
	- Remainder Theorem / Vector Theorem
		- If you plug-in a number and it gives you 0, it's an x-intercept and it creates a factor.
	- When finding factors
		- Factor
		- Quadratic Formula
		- Rational Zeros Theorem

	- The list of numbers that you get is not dependent on whether you factor or not
		- Factor out the 3 first
	- Rational Zeros Theorem would not give you the $\sqrt{5}$ solution

	- Grouping only works with 4 terms
	- Complex solutions always come in pairs
	- If you're given a list 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18, 36 and 1 works. You need to check 1 again after doing synthetic/long division.
		- If 2 didn't work in the first polynomial, it won't work in a more factored form of the original polynomial

	- Since we found the ONLY negative x-intercept, you do NOT have to try any negatives here (-1)

	- Synthetic division with fractions
	- $x^4 + 24x^2 - 25$ is a special form of a quartic
		- Could do a substitution to solve for it with u
