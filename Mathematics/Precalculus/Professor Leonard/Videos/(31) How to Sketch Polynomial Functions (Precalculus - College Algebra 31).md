	- (1) Leading term
		- Degree
		- Maximum Turning Points
		- End Behavior
	- (2) y-int
	- (3) x-int
	- Will need to learn how to factor polynomials with a degree greater than 4 since the quadratic formula only works on polynomials with a degree of 2
	- An irreducible quadratic is something that you cannot factor over the real numbers
	- There is a theorem that says you can factor any polynomial into linear or irreducible quadratic factors
		- Comes from factor theorem
		- Every odd function needs an x-intercept
			- Therefore, you can always reduce cubic
	- In Calculus 1, you can find the local minimum from a polynomial
	- Right graph is fairly dynamic

	- For the left graph, if you evaluate x=-1, you get 54. This would definitely have given a better graph.
	- Zero product property
	- On right graph, there is a dashed line across the left point. This is to help you indicate that there will be a bounce when drawing the graph.
		- Just a queue for you but not official

	- For the left graph to get an accurate graph, you should take a point between 2 x-intercepts and also a point outside the x-intercepts.
		- Should find 5 values in this case
	- This will be content for Calc 1: 
		- Take basic derivative, set equal to 0 and then plot the values of critical points
		- Without calculus 1, you need to guess for turning points
	- Oblique asymptotes are slant asymptotes
