	- Rational inequalities
		- For $\ge$ 0, $\le$ 0
			- Find Zeros... Numerator = 0
			- Find vertical asymptote ... Denominator = 0
	- The truth is opposite across odd multiplicity.
	- The truth is the same across even multiplicity with regarded x-intersects (but also vertical asymptotes)
	- Odd means opposite truth for vertical asymptotes and x-intercepts
	- Even means same truth for vertical asymptotes and x-intercepts
	- For the right-most problem
		- Technically, you'd get 2 holes due to the denominator containing the same factors if $x^2-1$ was in the numerator instead of $x^2+1$
	- If the right-most problem had an even vertical asymptote

	- For $\ge$, $\le$ constant or function
		- (1) Set = to find intersection
		- (2) Find vertical asymptote where denominator = 0
	- You could find common denominator and combine like terms but that may take more work
