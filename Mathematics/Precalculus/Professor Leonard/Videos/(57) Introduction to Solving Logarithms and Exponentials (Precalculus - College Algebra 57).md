	- Steps
		- Look for common bases $1^{st}$
		- For logs, write equation in exponential form
		- For exp, write in log form
	- Arguments of logarithms need to be strictly greater than 0
		- Always want to check
	- Typically don't like to see negatives on the denominator
	- For $ln_ee^{2x} = 8$
		- Composed an exponential onto a logarithm
		- Since we just composed 2 inverses, they cancel. The "x" in this case is the exponent

	- Make sure bases are not negative
	- Only have about 4 properties of logarithms
	- Should put parentheses around argument of a logarithm to avoid confusion ^a60b83
	- Best form of exact solution includes logs
