	- Arithmetic Sequences
		- A sequence where the difference between any 2 sequential terms is constant .... called the common difference "d"
			- (Adding same # over + over)
	- Arithmetic sequences can always be written as
		- $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$
			- $a_1$ is where to start
			- $(n-1)$ is how many "d" to add
	- Recursively means based on the previous term

	- The 8th term of an arithmetic sequence is 75. The 20th is 39. Find the formula + the 12th term
		- $a_n = a_1 + (n-1)d$
