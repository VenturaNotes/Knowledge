	- Odd asymptotes means opposite infinities
	- Horizontal asymptote is at y=0 because as the denominator reaches positive infinity, f($\infty$) = 0 and same for f($-\infty$) = 0
	- Key points of $\frac 1x$which is an odd function
		- (1, 1)
		- (-1,-1)
	- Key point of $\frac {1}{x^2}$ which is an even function
		- (1,1)
		- (-1,1)
	- The +3 is a vertical shift (anything after a function outside the parentheses is a vertical shift)
	- Do vertical shift first before horizontal shift
	- g(x) is only even in relation to the vertical asymptote
		- However, it's not an even function anymore after the transformation
	- Even vertical asymptotes have to have at least a symmetry of infinity along vertical asymptote. Both will go to positive infinity or both will go to negative infinity.

	- Errata
		- For left problem, the vertical asymptote is at x=-3
	- 2 multiplies the output

		- If the denominator has a lower constant, the graph will be similar to $\frac 1x$. Otherwise, it'll flip horizontally
		- Horizontal asymptote is 1 because $\frac xx$ = 1
	- A negative divided by a really small positive is a really negative number
	- If we plug-in values that get really close to -1 in $(x+1)$, this is called the limit.
