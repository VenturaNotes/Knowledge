	- Focusing on what happens on domain
	- You can never cancel out of the main problem
		- Can develop new domain problems while doing operations
	- Denominators should always be factored
	- $\frac {1}{(3x-2)^2}$
		- Denominator tells us the multiplicity (because it's squared). Since it's squared, the vertical asymptote means that the function is even meaning that the function mirrors across the vertical asymptote

	- If you divide, you will get the same domain as well as add other issues to the domain problems you already have

	- Multiplication is commutative
		- "The property that allows two or more factors to be multiplied in any order without changing the product"[^1]
	- Division is not commutative
	- Multiply the reciprocal when dividing 2 fractions
	- Next video will be about graphs of functions. Determining if 1 input has to give you 1 output, we'll learn how to determine that graphically
		- Vertical line test
		- Even vs odd functions
