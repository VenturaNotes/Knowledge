	- Average rate of change is the slope between 2 points on a curve (this is called the secant)
		- Secant line finds the average slope between 2 points
		- That's why it's called average rate of change than slope
	- The secant line represents the slope of the tangent line but it doesn't represent it well if the 2 points are far apart form each other.
	- One of the theorems in calculus (our derivative), when we make that point so close to be negligibly different, then the slope of the secant line is actually by definition the slope of the tangent line
	- Goal is to find the instantaneous rate of change
