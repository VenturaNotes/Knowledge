	- Compound Interest
		- $A = P(1 + \frac rn)^{nt}$
			- n = # of compounds in 1 year
				- Value of n
					- Annual = 1
					- Semi-annual = 2
					- Quarterly = 4
					- Monthly = 12
					- Weekly = 52
					- Daily = 365
			- A = Amount (future Value)
			- P = Present value (Principal)
				- It is the present value of your investment (or your loan)
					- Your bank uses the money you give it as a loan and they try to make money from it so that you can make interest over time.
			- r = Rate
				- Always in decimal form
			- t = Years
				- Always based on years
		- For Continuously
			- $A = Pe^{rt}$
	- $3,000 invested at 9.25% compounded monthly for $2 \frac 12$ years.
	- ...Compounded continuously
	- Getting interest on original amount but also on the part that was added. It ends up being more interest at the end of 1 year than 9.25%
		- This is typically known as the [[effective yield]]

	- Question 2
		- How much should be invested at 8.5% compounded daily to earn $800 in $3\frac 14$ years?
			- to earn $800 in the account at the end of 3.25 years?
				- This is the better wording to the above problem because it's a little ambiguous. Otherwise, it'd be 800 + P.
				- Question is worded poorly in general.
		- And compounded continuously?
	- Question 3
		- How long does it take to double an investment at 4.5% compounded quarterly?
		- And compounded continuously?
			- Faster than non-continuous
		- Make sure to put parentheses around logarithms and natural logs

	- This is the simple interest rate that is equal to the compound interest earned each year
		- Effective Rate (Compounded Interest)
			- $r_E = (1 + \frac rn)^n - 1$
		- Effective Rate (For Continuously)
			- $r_E=e^r-1$
	- Find effective rate for 9.75% compounded monthly
	- And compounded continuously
	- Effective rate tells you how much interest you're actually making in 1 year (10.2% in the first example)
	- When solving for time, you need to use logarithms
