	- Every 1 to 1 function needs to have an inverse
	- To find the points of the inverse of a function, just reverse the points x and y.
		- Horizontal asymptote on x-axis will become vertical asymptote on y-axis
	- Logarithms solve for your exponent. It separates the base from the exponent and exponential notation puts it back together.
		- Base for logarithm is the same as the base for the exponent.
	- Logarithms:
		- Domain: (0, $\infty$ )
		- Range: ($-\infty$, $\infty$ )
		- Key Points
			- (1, 0)
			- (a, 1)
			- Vertical asymptote at x = 0

	- Exponential notation (5 equations to left)
		- Will write as logarithms
	- How to read logarithms ($log_39 = 2$)
		- 3 raised to what power will give you 9
		- In order to get from 3 to 9, what power do you need?
	- How to read $log_a2.1 = 3$
		- Log base a of 2.1 equals 3
			- Never say log of a of 2.1 (because that log "of" will always have a base of 10)
	- The logarithm separates the base from the exponent
	- When you have a common logarithm $\log 2.3 = x$
		- Just say log of 2.3
	- This is a natural log $ln 8=x$
		- This all means that we have a logarithm with base of e
			-  "ln 8"
			- "ln of 8"
			- "Natural log of 8"
		- Natural logs are incredibly common
	- Base of a logarithm must be greater than 0 (all positive)
	- Logarithms solve exponentials as addition solves subtraction

	- When you see an exponential inside a logarithm with the same, they'll cancel
	- Anytime you see an exponential with a logarithm in the exponent with the same base, those are going to cancel too.
	- Any logarithm of 1 will give 0

	- Argument of logarithm > 0
		- Argument is 5 in $log5$ 
	- Logarithms need positive domain
