	- Errata
		- g(1) = -2
			- Forgot the negative
	- Composite functions
		- When one entire function is substituted into the variable of another function
		- For f(x), g(x)
			- $(f\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$
				- f of g of x
	- Exponentials and logarithms are inverses
		- If you compose them, they cancel each other out.
	- The domain of composition functions is a combination of the inside function's domain combined with what you get at the end.
	- If your composition is the same (f$\circ$g) and (g$\circ$f), then the functions are inverses.
- Will learn about in future videos what happens when you don't always have all real numbers in your domain
