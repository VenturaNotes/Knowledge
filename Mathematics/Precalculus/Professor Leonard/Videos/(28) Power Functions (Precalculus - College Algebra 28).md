	- Power functions
		- Tells you the end behavior of a polynomial
	- Even function symmetrical about the y-axis
	- Odd function is symmetrical about the origin
	- Odd functions
		- Key Points
			- (-1,-1)
			- (0,0)
			- (1,1)
		- This is ONLY if a = 1 ... if 'a' is not 1, then the OUTPUT of the key points are changed
		- Range
			- (-$\infty$, $\infty$)
		- Symmetry about origin
	- Even function
		- Key Points
			- (-1, 1)
			- (0,0)
			- (1,1)
		- Only if a = 1
		- Range
			- $[0, \infty)$ or $[-\infty, 0)$ or 
		- Symmetry about y-axis
	- Higher the degree of the leading term, the more dynamic the polynomial is
	- Domain: All Real #'s
	- Examples

			- Only 4 kinds of curves
	- Transformation of an even function does not keep it an even function
		- $f(x) = (x+2)^2$ is not an even function
