	- Steps
		- (1) Find a Zero
		- (2) Create a factor
			- Linear for a real zero
				- synthetic division
			- Quadratic for a complex pair
				- Long division
		- (3) Try to factor or repeat
	- Factors with complex number system: $f(x) = (x-4)(x-2i)(x+2i)$
	- Factors with real number system: $f(x) = (x-4)(x^2+4)$
	- Have to distribute and simplify $(x-3) + 2i$ and its conjugate because it can't be the divisor for another polynomial over the real number system.
	- You have an irreducible quadratic because that gave you complex solutions
	- Degree of a polynomial
		- Maximum number of factors you can have for real numbers
		- Exact number of factors if you have complex

	- Multiplicity comes from the power of the factor (not the term)

	- When finding the factors of a number, if you go from 5 to 15, you know that you found all the factors (crossed the bridge)
