	- Synthetic + Long Division of Polynomials
	- Factor Theorem:
		- If, upon division, you get a remainder of "0", your divisor is a factor of your dividend.
	- Rational Zeros Theorem
		- Gives a list of numbers that are potential zeros for function
	- If you plug-in x=1 and the output of f(x) equals 0, then "x-1" has to be a factor
	- Synthetic division only works if
		- you have a linear "x-1"
		- Coefficient of x has to be equal to 1 as well
			- Divisor
		- "x" must also be a constant. Can't be $x^2$ or $x^3$ 
	- Long Division
		- Use parenthesis. It helps.

	- We know that $3x^5$ will have at least 1 x-intercept because it has an odd power.
	- g(x) is not completely factored but we would use the rational Zeros Theorem again to find more potential divisors to further factor the polynomial.

	- Place remainder over divisor if you have a remainder and add it to the factored polynomial
