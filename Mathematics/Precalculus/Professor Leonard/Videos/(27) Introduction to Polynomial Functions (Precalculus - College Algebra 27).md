	- [[Leading term]]
		- Term with largest exponent
			- Only coefficient that you don't want to be 0
		- Will get end behavior, degree, # of zeros if we include complex numbers
		- Gives maximum number of turning points if you subtract 1 from the degree
		- Leading coefficient is the number in front of the leading term (not including x)
			- Will give us the rational zeros theorem
	- [[Constant Term]]
		- If you don't have it, you could factor out an x
		- Should be last
		- Not considered a coefficient
	- [[Degree]]
		- The largest exponent in the polynomial
	- For degree 5 any higher polynomials, there is no such thing as a formula to give you zeros
		- Up to power 4 there is, but it is extremely difficult
		- We do have rational zeros theorem though
	- Some coefficients can be 0 for polynomials
	- [[Polynomial]]
		- Many terms
		- Separated by $\pm$ which is what creates the terms
		- You don't have to have more than 1 term to define a polynomial, but most of the time you have more than 1 term
		- Exponents on terms should be in descending order
		- No fractional or rational exponents allowed. No square roots in polynomials
			- You could still have an irrational number as a coefficient though
			- Nonnegative integers not allowed either for exponents
		- Domain is all real numbers ($\mathbb{R}$)
			- Smooth continuous curve with no cusps (sharp points), no gaps, no holes, and no asymptotes
	- Radicals, logarithms, and denominators with variables inside them cause domain problems
		- Logarithms
			- Must be only positive
		- Radicals
			- Must be positive or 0
			- No need to worry about odd roots
		- Denominators
			- Can't equal 0
			- Dividing by 0 creates a vertical asymptote
	- Notes
		- Exponents are all non-negative integers. Order by descending exponents
	- You could give a polynomial a 0 coefficient
	- If you have a 0 constant, there would be no degree for the polynomial
		- Due to a multiplicative constructs
		- It's a weird one. It's just a 0 function.
	- If you have any other number as a constant, the degree would be 0
	- The degree 4 of $f(x) = 9x^4 - \pi x^2 + \frac 12$ tells us that it is an even based polynomial
		- That end behavior is given by leading term and degree
	- A rational function is a polynomial divided by another polynomial
	- A hole is a removable discontinuity if we're able to cancel terms
		- Says that we're missing a point
	- $G(x) = 2\sqrt{x}(\sqrt{x}+1)$ is a radical expression
		- Our domain for polynomials has to be all real numbers all the time.
	- Positive and odd degree $2x^7$
