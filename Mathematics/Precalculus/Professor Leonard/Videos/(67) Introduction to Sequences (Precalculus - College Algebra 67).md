	- Errata
		- Term for $\frac {n}{3^n}$ in $b_n$ should be $\frac {5}{243}$ and not $\frac {5}{247}$
	- A sequence is a list of numbers given by a formula and determined by the index of each term.
		- They are not added or multiplied, just listed with commas between them.
		- Index is the number of the term that we have in our sequence
			- Subscript is known as the index
		- n cannot be fractions, can't be decimals and can't be negative
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">n can be 0th term</mark>
		- n is the natural numbers
		- Index will always be a natural number (1,2,3) some counting numbers
			- Just plugging in whole positive natural numbers to get the terms
				- Probably whole numbers? (since 0 is included)
		- The sequence should have some kind of pattern to the numbers.
		- The nth term (if it stays in terms of n), is sometimes called the general term $(n^2+1)$
	- Right-most problem is alternating between positive and negative: $(-1)^{n-1}$
		- This is due to the odd or even number in the exponent
	- $(-1)^{n-1}$ or $(-1)^{n}$ 
		- This will give you a sign alternation for every term
	- This concept is very popular in Calculus 2
	- A series takes a sequence and adds it up

	- Goal is to find the pattern. Relate the pattern to the index and you'll find the general term
	- Steps
		- Write down all the terms first
		- Make them appear all the same form
		- Write them as something that can be represented the same in all of them
			- Odd numbers?
			- Power of something?
		- We see every term has 1 on the numerator
		- Denominator seems to be increasing by a power of 2
		- Relate whatever is changing to your index
	- Could solve the right-most problem with recursion
		- $a_n = a_{n-1} + 2$
		- $a_4 = a_3+2$
		- Almost like induction when we get there
	- $b_n = 2n-1$ is how odd numbers are defined (especially in number theory)
		- Even is 2n
	- Recursive form requires you to look at your previous terms.
