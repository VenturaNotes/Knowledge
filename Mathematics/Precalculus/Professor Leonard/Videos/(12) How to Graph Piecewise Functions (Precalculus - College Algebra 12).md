	- A piecewise function gives you a function in pieces
		- Need directions on how to use each piece of it
		- Can only use 1 piece for certain sections or intervals of your x-axis
			- This tells you the domain
	- f(1) can only fit in 1 spot of the piecewise function
		- You will never have a function where you can plug in a value to 2 different pieces
	- Vertical asymptote and boundary line can appear the same
		- Delineating intervals of x-axis 
	- Separate domains into intervals
	- Left-most problem happens to be a continuous function
		- This is when you can draw a function completely without lifting up your pen
	- The intervals do not need to have the same numbers as the boundary.
	- Open circle means point is not included. Closed circle means point is included
