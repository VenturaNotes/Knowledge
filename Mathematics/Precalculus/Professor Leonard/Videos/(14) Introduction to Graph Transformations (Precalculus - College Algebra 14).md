	- Transformations moves functions up or down, left or right, or stretches and compresses, or reflects it.
	- Trigonometric functions have graphs that go on forever
	- [[Vertical Shift]] (saying that the output of a function with addition or subtraction will affect the output value)
		- f(x) + x
			- Shift Up
		- f(x) - k
			- Shift Down
	- [[Horizontal Shift]]
		- f(x+h)
			- Shift Left
			- In order to undo the adding to an input, you'd have to give be a smaller value that's to the left
		- f(x-h)
			- Shift Right
			- In order to undo subtracting from your input, you'd have to give a bigger value in order to undo that and get the same height out of it.
		- Note
			- Usually anything in parentheses is always opposite of your intuition
	- Key points important
		- Function is even
			- (1,1)
			- (0,0)
			- (-1,1)
		- Function is odd
			-  (1,1)
			- (0,0)
			- (-1,-1)

	- [[Vertical Stretch and Compression]]
		- y = af(x)
			- a > 1
				- Stretch
				- Narrow
			- a < 1
				- Compression
				- wide
		- Grows the outputs
	- [[Horizontal Stretch and Compression]]
		- y = f(ax)
			- a > 1
				- Horizontal Compression
			- a < 1
				- Horizontal Stretch
		- Can be changed to a vertical stretch or compression
			- With trigonometry, you can't really do (but will be a different way to approach it)
	- [[Reflection]]
		- y = -f(x)
			- About x-axis
		- y = f(-x)
		- About y-axis
			- Affects input before you even got to the function
		- Changes sign of input or output
		- When reflecting graph vertically, you're reflecting about the x-axis
	- f(x) stands for the output value of the function 
	- A vertical stretch is a horizontal compression. A vertical compression is a horizontal stretch
	- Adding a negative sign causes a reflection
