	- Intro to functions 
		- A [[function]] is a relationship that maps 1 input (x-values) to 1 output (y or f(x) values)
			- $*$ An input never gives more than 1 output
		- In y = f(x) which can be written as the ordered pair (x, y) or (x, f(x))
			- "x" is the independent variable
			- "y" or "f(x)" is the dependent variable
		- [[Domain (Math)|domain]] is the set of inputs (x's)
		- [[Range]] is the set of outputs (y's)
	- Others
		- A function and a one-to-one is not the same thing.
		- A [[one-to-one function]] is when an input results in a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">unique</mark> output
		- [[Input]] is always the [[independent variable]] (x-value)
		- [[Ordered pair]]
		- Graphing these functions on a [[Coordinate Plane|Real Coordinate Plane]]

	- S is easily a function because each ordered pair has a unique x-value which guarantees that there is no input value with 2 output values.
	- R is a [[non-function]]
	- If you can solve a function for y without $\pm$, then it's a function
		- An equation with $y^2$ indicates that it's not a function because you'll have to solve for the square root
	- When you square root something, you have to put the $\pm$ (for even roots)
		- If the square root is given to you, you don't need the $\pm$
