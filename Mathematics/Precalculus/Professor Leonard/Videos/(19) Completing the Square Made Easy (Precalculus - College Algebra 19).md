	- We use trigonometry substitution in Calculus 2 for integrals and you have to complete the square on some of the problems
	- Completing the square is forcing the quadratic to become a perfect square in order to factor it
	- a needs to be 1
	- Doing completing the square in the way shown in the right-most problem will automatically put a quadratic in Vertex Form. Very useful for transformations.

	- Rarely going to complete the square to find the x-intercepts because it takes too long. Most likely just going to use the quadratic formula as it's quicker
