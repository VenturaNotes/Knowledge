	- Rules
		- Every Polynomial can be factored into linear + irreducible quadratics over the real # system. But if we allow complex solutions, the polynomial can be factored into all linears
		- Degree = # of linear factors
			- = # of solutions
			- over complex numbers
		- Notes
			- A conjugate of a + bi is a-bi
			- All complex solutions come in conjugate pairs.
	- A conjugate is 2 terms with a different sign in the middle
	- Will always have an even number of complex solutions
