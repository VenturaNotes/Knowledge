	- Quadratic expressions
		- A is positive, opens upward
		- A is negative, opens downward
		- Largest degree must be 2
		- In general, they're all parabolas
	- f(x) represents height of function
	- To find x-intercepts(also called roots or zeros), set function equal to 0 because where the height is 0, we'll be on the x-axis. Those x values will be where that function crosses the x-axis
	- Square root method
	- Factoring method
	- Completing the square method
		- More likely will go to quadratic formula method
	- A parabola cannot cross the x-axis more than twice.
	- You can never have less than 2 solutions
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">First Graph</mark>
		- 2 Solutions
		- 2 Real Solutions
		- 2 Real X-intercepts
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Second Graph</mark> (Vertex. The equation bounces or touches it. We don't cross it but the vertex is right on the x-axis)
		- We get the same solution twice (called a double root)
		- Will Get 1 unique solution
		- 1 Real Solution (same number twice)
		- 1 x-intercept
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Third Graph</mark>
		- 2 Complex Solutions
		- No x-intercepts
	- Solving quadratic equations means that we're going to be finding zeros/roots/x-intercepts.
