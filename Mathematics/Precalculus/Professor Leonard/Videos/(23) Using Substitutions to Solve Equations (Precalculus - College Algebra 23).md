	- Find appropriate number of solutions for whatever polynomial we're dealing with
	- Helps with u-sub from calc 2
	- Typically you want to find the number of solutions of a polynomial based on its highest degree
	- When substituting with "u", the value of "u" needs to be the same in all instances
	- Rationalizing the denominator is important

	- A square root can't equal a negative number so $x=25$ cannot be a solution
		- If it's outside the range for what you can get for your x function, then you have to exclude that.
		- With cubics, there are no exclusions
	- Make first term positive
	- Multiply by conjugate if $-1 + \sqrt{3}$ is in the denominator
