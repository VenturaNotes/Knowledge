	- The maximum value of a downward opening parabola would be located at its vertex
	- The minimum value of an upward opening parabola would be located at its vertex
	- At 300 items, the price is 0. Past that, you'd have to pay people to take the item... not good.
	- Left-most problem
		- Revenue
		- Price
			- Price should be $50 for each item to make maximum revenue. Sell all 150 of them.
		- Maximum Revenue
	- Area: 3000' of fence for a rectangular area. Find maximum area available

		- In this case, you limit it by the perimeter
	- The greatest area for a perimeter in the shape of a rectangle will be a square
	- For h(x) problem, 
		- Height of a projectile starting at $45\degree$ with a 2000ft/sec launch
		- To find effective range, set function equal to 0
			- This is to figure out when it hits the ground
		- To find maximum height
			- Find vertex which is the $\frac {-b}{2a}$
