	- Multiplicity
		- All Roots intersect the x-axis but
			- (1) Roots w/ even multiplicity bounce/touch
			- (2) Roots w/ odd multiplicity cross
	- End Behavior (based on leading term)

			- Positive/negative constant and even/odd power
	- Notes
		- If a poly has degree "n", then there will be at most n-1 "turning points" (local max/min)
		- All poly create continuous curves w/ no "cusps"
	- Multiplicity
		- Repeated 0 or root or x-intercept in a polynomial
		- You can have the same root twice
	- Multiplicity is a repeated 0 (can get same thing twice) and determines what happens with your graph (whether it be a bounce from the x-intercept or crosses)
	- Look at the exponent that is on the factor for where you got your 0 and that is your multiplicity (number of times your root is repeated)
	- [[Multiplicity]] means take a polynomial and factor it. From those factors, if you set the function equal to 0 to find the x-intercepts, from those factors you'll get your roots. If we do that, use the zero product property and solve them. You will get the real zeros and the number of times they are repeated comes from the exponent of each factor from where you got your zeros. That's how many times the zero will be repeated and that's called multiplicity.
	- Can use sign analysis test in Calc 1 to figure out a turning point.

		- If you find the leading term, the graph would be odd reflected
