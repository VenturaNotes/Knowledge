	- Errata
		- Interval correction for f(x) > 0: 10 < x $\le$ 11
			- 11 is included
		- Interval correction for f(x) < 0: -6 $\le$ x < -4
			- -6 is included
	- Graphs are a representation of every point that satisfies a function that you're given
	- When given "f" of anything such as f(3), they just want the y-value
	- > means strictly greater than
	- Inequality notation or interval notation
	- When talking about x-interval, we talk about increasing or decreasing
		- For positive and negative functions, we talk about domain
			- When finding f(x) > 0, you are looking for an interval where the function is positive
	- Domain
		- What interval of the x-axis does my graph cover?
	- When function equals 0, you are looking for the x-intercepts
	- When finding f(0), you are looking for the output of the function
	- A function cannot have more than 1 y-intercept
		- Would fail the vertical line test.
	- When using "" below a sentence, it just means it's being repeated without needing to rewrite

	- Interval of x-axis that our graph covers is domain
	- Interval of y-axis that graph covers is range
	- Always have strictly less than for infinities
	- Open circle means that the point is missing
		- It's called removable discontinuity (Calculus)
		- Could be an endpoint too
	- Domain is an interval of outputs. The 4th problem is 0 < x < 7 because 0 and 7 are not included in the outputs
	- f(x) = 2
		- Important because helps with finding inverses, exponential functions, and domain
	- $2 = \frac {x+2}{x-6}$
		- This is a proportion or a rational equation
		- Multiply both sides by LCD
		- Want all the terms with the variable you're trying to solve for on one side and all the terms without that variable on the other side.
	- Domain is the set of inputs that give you defined real number outputs
		- Need to "disinclude" 6 if it makes the denominator equal to 0
	- x-intercepts will always be achieved when setting output equal to 0
	- $0 = \frac {x+2}{x-6}$
		- Allowed to simply multiply the denominator by (x-6) on both sides. 
		- If it's an inequality, you might not be able to do that? Instead multiply by squared version of denominator? [^1]
	- Questions
		- Completing the points
			- (1) When given an input value, find the output value
			- (2) When given an output value, find the input value
			- (3) Domain is where the function is on the x-interval
			- (4) To find x-intercept, set function equal to 0
			- (5) To find y-intercept, set x equal to 0
	- Next time, will talk about even vs odd
