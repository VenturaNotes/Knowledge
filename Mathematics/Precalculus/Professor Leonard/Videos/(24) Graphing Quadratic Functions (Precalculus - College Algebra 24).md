	- Quadratic is a polynomial of the second degree
	- a > 0
		- upper opening
		- The minimum of this function would be where the vertex occurs (y-value is the answer)
	- a < 0
		- downward opening
	- a > |1|
		- Vertical Stretch
	- a < |1|
		- Vertical compression
	- Every parabola has a y-intercept
	- Find the y-intercept
		- (0,C)

				- It should be from original equation
	- Find the x-intercept
		- $ax^2+bx+c=0$
	- Find the Vertex
		- $\frac{-b}{2a}, f(x)$
		- Or Complete the square for vertex form
			- Great way to graph a parabola on the coordinate plane
	- Every parabola is symmetrical
		- We have something called axis of symmetry (which will always go through vertex)
			- Any point on one side of the axis of symmetry, you can mirror that image on the other side being equidistant from it
	- $\approx$ means about equal to
	- Find 5 points to plot a parabola
	- Every parabola has a vertex
	- For a downwards pointing parabola, the vertex will be the absolute maximum point of the graph.
	- You can factor/simplify a quadratic before using the quadratic formula
	- Vertex form means you can easily find the vertex

	- $\phi$ 
		- Used to denote an empty set.
	- When graphing a quadratic, do these in order
		- Vertex
		- x-intercept
		- y-intercept

	- For a parabola with a vertex of (1,-5) and a y-int of -3, find the function: $$f(x) = a(x+h)^2 + k$$
	- The function is shown in standard form at the end.
