- Hierarchy
	- Computable Numbers. Examples shown are transcendental numbers. (Includes natural log of 2, $\pi$ and e. e was proved in 1873, $\pi$ was proved in 1882 and $e^{\pi}$ was proved in 1934) All computable numbers and below are known as the countable infinity. The vast majority of numbers are not computable. The infinity of non-computable numbers is greater than the infinity of computable numbers.
		- Algebraic Numbers (solution to an algebraic equation. Example is cube root of 2).
			- [[Constructible Numbers]] [^1]  (things that we can construct with a pencil and a compass and a ruler. Includes $\phi$ and $\sqrt 2$ )
				- Rational Numbers
					- Whole Numbers
	- Normal Numbers (every possible subgrouping of digits is equally likely to be in there. We don't know if $\pi$ is in there. We didn't start with the numbers below and try to figure out if they're normal. People sat down and wanted to figure out how to make a normal number)
		- We have managed to prove "Champernowne constant" (pretty much just all the integers in base 10. It is basically an artificial number. It is all the whole numbers listed out and turned into digits). It is computable too.
			- 0.1234567891011121314151617181920....
			- It is transcendental in base 10 (but we could do it in different bases?)
		- Copeland-Erdos (more efficient way of doing it but it's just the prime numbers.)
			- 0.23571113171923293137414347
		- There is no process for taking a number and proving that it's normal
		- We have been able to prove that most numbers are normal and uncomputable.
- Venn Diagrams are different from [[(Video) Arguments and Euler diagrams|Euler diagrams]] because you are not showing every single possible combination. The diagram above is an Euler diagram
	- Not every combination is shown because they might not exist in the real world. Venn Diagrams show combinations that could potentially not exist in the real world
- Chaitin's constant (outside of computable numbers)
	- The probability for a certain way of writing a computer program if you generate a computer program at random, if it will run and come to a stop. And it depends on how you write a program so in fact there are many of these constants, but we know they are all outside the computable numbers and the only way to get them is to work out every single digit individually. There is no equation or algorithm that spits it out. It's an uncomputable number
	- It's an uncomputable number.
