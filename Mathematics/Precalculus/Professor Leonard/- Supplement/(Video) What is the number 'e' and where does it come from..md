	- Exponential growth comes from
		- $A = P(1+r)^n$ 
			- $x^2$ and $x^{300}$ all grow really fast but don't grow as fast as an exponential growth
			- Larger a population gets, the faster they can grow
			- Gonna get ever faster and proportional to how big something is
		- The more money you have, the more interest you can make.
	- From monthly to daily, you've increased your rate of compound dramatically (12 times a year to 365 times a year)
		- But you've only gained an additional 10 cents given you start with $1
	- Infinity is not a number. It's just an idea
	- e is the number of proportional growth or proportional decay
		- That's why it's so important. It's a number that ex
	- e comes from a structure that exists in nature
		- Namely how things grow (in relation to their own size)
		- Or how things decay when they decay with relation to their own size
			- Such as half-lives
	- $D = (1-r)^n$ is for decay and $A=(1+r)^n$ is for growth
	- e is the number of proportionality or proportional growth or proportional decay
		- A number that exists in reality
