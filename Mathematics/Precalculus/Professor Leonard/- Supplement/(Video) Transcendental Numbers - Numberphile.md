- An irrational number means it can't be expressed as a fraction
- You can write $\pi$ as a decimal expansion (although you'll never get it write)
- Game is to reduce numbers to 0.
	- Rules are that you can only use whole numbers to do it.
		- You can add, subtract, multiply, and put the whole thing to a power (but the power needs to be a whole number)
			- $+,-,x-()^n$
- Algebraic numbers (family of numbers they all belong to)
	- 10 - 10 = 0 (numbers we're typically familiar with)
	- $4(\frac 34) - 3$ = 0 (rational)
	- $(\sqrt{2})^2$ - 2 = 0 (irrational)
	- $(\sqrt{-1})^2 + 1 = 0$ (imaginary/complex numbers)
		- Called complex number or imaginary number
			- Imaginary number is a terrible name for it.
		- Real Numbers and Imaginary numbers are complex numbers [^1]

				- Zero is both real, imaginary, and complex
	- $((\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})^2 - 5)^2 - 24 = 0$
	- All of the above could be represented as
		- $x-10=0$
		- $4x-3 = 0$
		- $x^2-2 = 0$
		- $x^2+1$ = 0
		- $(x^2-5)^2-24 = 0$
			- $x^4-10x^2+1=0$ is expanded out
	- The $\sqrt{-1}$ is an algebraic number
- Given e and  $f(x) = e^x$ 
	- [[(Video) What is the number 'e' and where does it come from.|The y-value is also the slope of the tangent at that point]]

	- Important to natural growth (means a lot to life)
- Infinite sum of e

- Charles Hermite
	- He claims that if there does exist some algebra that can bring it down to 0, he showed that it can lead to a contradiction
		- He showed that there was a whole number between 0 and 1 (which there obviously isn't)
		- $$ \begin{align}  a_ne^n + a_{n-1}e^{n-1} + ... &+a_1e + a_0 = 0 \\ 0 < a < 1 \end{align}  $$
	- To show that something is possible, assume that it is true and then you show that it creates a contradiction
	- He shows that e is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not</mark> algebraic
		- it transcends math
		- e is transcendental
- Joseph Liouville
	- He discovered a transcendental number 30 years before e (through construction)
- $\pi$ is the superstar of math. 
	- The concept is over 2000 years old
	- You can add to the knowledge of $\pi$ 
- Carl Louis Ferdinand von Lindemann
	- 1880s
	- He showed that e raised to any algebraic number is transcendental ($e^a$)
	- He proved by contradiction that $\pi$ is an algebraic number
		- Engineers say that $\pi$ is about $\frac {22}{7}$
			- $\sqrt[3]{31}$ is a good approximation as well
	- Euler's Identity is $e^{i\pi}$ = -1
		- If we assume $\pi$ is algebraic, that means $i\pi$ is algebraic. However, e to an algebraic number has to be transcendental but "-1" is not transcendental. Therefore, $\pi$ must be transcendental
