- Golden rectangle
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-08 at 7.45.03 PM.png|300]]
	- People believe it is the most aesthetically pleasing quadrilateral
	- The ratio from its long side to its short side is $\phi$ $\approx$ 1.618
- $\phi$ is the golden ratio. It can't be written as a simple integer ratio.
	- Phi is an irrational number
	- $\phi$ = $\frac{1+ \sqrt{5}}{2}$
		- Euclid noticed that it can't be written as a simple integer ratio. He was big into geometry
			- He wrote "The Elements", which was the best selling book ever until the 20th century
- One special way to divide a line. The ratio of the whole to the longer segment was the same as the ratio of the longer segment to the shorter one
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-08 at 7.52.35 PM.png]]
	- This ratio is $\phi$ 
	- Euclid called it the extreme and mean ratio
- $\pi$ is the ratio of a circle's circumference to it's diameter ($\frac cd$)

	- The ratio of the longest sides of the triangle to its short sides is $\phi$. 
		- Golden triangle (or sublime triangle)
		- Angles are 36, 72, and 72
	- If you divide one of the long sides according to the golden ratio and make a smaller triangle there, it's another golden triangle. Same angles and all.
	- The other triangle we created is $\frac {1}{\phi}$. 
		- This shape is called the [[golden gnomon]]
	- If you took 1 golden triangle and put 2 golden gnomons on the side, you get a regular pentagon
	- Overlapping 2 smaller golden gnomons and adding a smaller golden triangle on the side
		- Creates a pentagram
	- If we continuously place golden rectangles inside a golden rectangle, we get a shape called the [[golden spiral]]
- 1 + $\phi$ = $\phi^2$ = 2.618...
- $\phi$ - 1  =$\frac {1}{\phi}$ = 0.618

	- Leonardo of Pisa (aka Fibonacci)
		- Around the year 1200, responsible for brining Hindu-Arabic numerals into common use across Europe
	- Merchants realized that doing arithmetic with these was way easier than roman numerals
		- Was already used in Asia for like 1000 years before then.
	- Fibonacci wrote a math textbook
		- Liber Abaci (book of calculation)
			- Taught people how to add, exchange currencies, and divide/multiply with these new numbers.
			- Chapter 12 had a weird problem about rabbits (which made fibonacci famous)
- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-08 at 8.45.09 PM.png]]
	- Number of pairs of rabbits
		- Each month, the number of pairs is equal to the sum of the previous 2 months. After 12 months, you'd have 144 pairs
			- This is the famous fibonacci sequence
				- Can carry it on forever. Just add the previous 2 numbers to get the next.
		- As you go on in the fibonacci sequence, the ratio between numbers gets closer and closer to $\phi$ 
			- In fact, any sequence of numbers that follows the fibonacci rule (adding the 2 previous to get the next, trends to $\phi$ )
			- The set of the [[(Video) Lucas Numbers - Numberphile|Lucas Numbers]] when taking the difference between 2 adjacent terms trends towards $\phi$ 
				- Johannes Kepler figured this out
					- Same guy who figured out how planets move
- Assumptions
	- "The truly mind-boggling aspect of $\phi$ was its roll as a fundamental building block in nature. Plants, animals, and even human beings all possessed dimensional properties that adhered with eerie exactitude to the ratio of $\phi$ to 1"
		- This was written in "The Da Vinci Code" by Dan Brown. It's a mystery thriller novel.
	- False ideas
		- Ideal ratio of a person's height to the distance of their navel to their feet is $\phi$ 
			- Beauty standards vary a lot in different cultures
		- Great Pyramid of Giza, Parthenon, Notre dame cathedral, Taj Mahal
			- People claim these were built with golden ratio dimensions but for an object that's large and complex, there's so many ways to measure it and so many measurements you can take. Some are just bound to be a golden ratio apart from each other.
		- 1 turn of a DNA helix to its width
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-08 at 9.05.21 PM.png|200]]
			- DNA's actual measurements
				- 1 turn: 34.86 $\mathring{A}$ 
				- Width: 20 $\mathring{A}$

	- Our brains love patterns. Might be able to see a face on something that is not even there
	- A nautilus shell 
		- Basically mascot of golden ratio
	- (FALSE) Claim that tracing the spiral of a shell will show that each ring is a golden ratio away from the next smallest ring. 
	- Like snail shells or sheep horns, their shape is known as a [[logarithmic spiral]]
		- Each turn of the spiral grows in the same proportion because the nautilus grows at the same rate
		- The proportion is not $\phi$

	- Phi shows up in nature in an interesting way
		- Pineapple
			- 13 spirals going one direction
			- 8 spirals going the opposite direction
		- Pinecone
			- 13 spirals going one direction
			- 8 spirals going the opposite direction
		- Sunflower
		- Artichoke
			- 8 spirals in one direction
			- 5 spirals in other direction
		- Branch of a monkey puzzle tree
			- 13 spirals going in one direction
			- 8 spirals going in a different direction
		- The numbers 13 and 8 are part of the fibonacci sequence

	- The more sun you can catch with your leaves, the better.
	- If we use any fraction of a circle with a whole number on the bottom, our leaves will eventually overlap. A rational number does not work
	- Irrational numbers can't be expressed as simple integer ratios
	- Phi might be the most irrational number that there is
	- Taking a turn of about $137.5\degree$, is called the [[golden angle]]
		- Fibonacci spirals form on their own just from the angle turn
	- Works for more than just leaves catching sunlight
		- Useful pattern for catching rain and funneling water down to your roots or packing more seeds and flower petals into a small space (sunflowers)
	- We know why plans do this with their leaves but not really how.
		- We do know that the angles have to do with newly growing plant parts repelling other nearby plant parts. This is sort of like how the poles of magnets are alike. They repel each other. This is mainly thanks to growth hormones and not magnets
		- Plenty of plants still follow different rules as well such as a $\frac 12$ ratio or a $\frac 14$ ratio
			- Something needs to work well enough. That's all that really matters in evolution.

	- Artists such as Salvador Dali and Le Corbusier occasionally use the golden ratio purposely in their work
		- There is a lot of art such as "The Mona Lisa" or "The Starry Night", which makes no use of the golden ratio
