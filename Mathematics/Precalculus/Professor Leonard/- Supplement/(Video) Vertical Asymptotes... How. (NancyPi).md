	- Find the vertical asymptote(s).
		- (1) Factor
		- (2) Cancel
		- (3) Set denom = 0
	- Horizontal asymptote was found here as well
	- Since no factors cancel in the denominator with the numerator, you have a vertical asymptote

	- Find all vertical asymptote(s)
		- (1) Factor
		- (2) Cancel
		- (3) Set denom = 0
	- Since you have factors that cancel, you have a hole where x=2

	- An imaginary complex number in the denominator means you don't get a vertical asymptote
