	- [[Algebraic Numbers]] (part of that big family)
		- Complex Number
			- $i$ (imaginary numbers)
			- Real Numbers 
				- Irrational
					- - $3\sqrt{2}$ 
					- $\phi$ 
				- Rationals
					- $\frac {-11}{7}$
					- Integers
						- -10, -1, -5
						- Natural numbers (counting numbers)
							- 3,6,2
	- They are being created, formed, and found through invented means
	- These numbers are all called algebraic because they can be solved in algebraic equations. There are numbers that don't belong to this set.
	- [[Transcendental Numbers]]
		- Can't build $\pi$ in any way using algebra
			- $\pi$ is not the solution to any polynomial equation.
		- In compound interest, there is no difference if you put $5000 in one bank and $1 in 5000 banks where the banks each have the same interest.
			- Ignoring fees and any other expenses..
			- Most banks actually do compounded interest 365 times a year (or once a day)
		- $e$ for exponential curve. This number is the number of exponential growth everywhere in the universe. And you can't build it like an algebraic expression
		- $e^{i\pi}$ = -1
		- Unable to build $\pi$ and $e$ with algebra
