	- The horizontal asymptote is 0 because the degree in the numerator is less than the degree in the denominator
	- If multiplicity is odd, graph is going to open on opposite sides of the horizontal asymptote (one above and one below)
	- Just plug-in a value for "x" to find your point on the left side of the vertical asymptote and the right side of the vertical asymptote
		- If the degree is odd and there is a negative sign out front, you would reflect across the x-axis
			- You could plug-in (1)
		- If you have an even degree, it will be on the same side of the horizontal asymptote. It would be reflected across the x-axis if it was negative
