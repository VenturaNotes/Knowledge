- [^1] A [[Venn diagram]] shows all possible logical relationships between a collection of sets. But a [[(Video) Euler Diagrams to determine if a logical argument is valid|Euler diagram]] only shows relationships that exist in the real world
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-08 at 5.45.37 PM.png]]
		- The Venn diagram shows all possible combinations where it shows the intersection of Mammals and Birds. However, a mammal can never be a bird and vice versa as they are part of different classes in the animal Kingdom
		- In the second example, You can never have a black card be a red card and vice versa. Also, only Red cards have diamonds so the Euler diagram is useful here.
- For certain quantifiable arguments, we can use Euler diagrams.
- Example 1:
	- All cats purr
	- Sparky is a cat
	- =============
	- $\therefore$ Sparky purrs
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-08 at 5.36.18 PM.png]]
			- You have a circle representing Purr "Purr"
			- You have a circle representing cats "c"
			- Red dot shows where Sparky is in the diagram
	- The argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">valid</mark>
- Example 2:
	- All trees are green
	- All Frogs are green
	- =============
	- $\therefore$ Frogs are trees
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-12 at 10.09.47 PM.png|400]]
			- Green represents all objects (creatures/vegetation/etc.)
			- 2 possibilities
		- This argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">invalid</mark>
- Example 3
	- All dogs chase tails
	- You are not a dog
	- =============
	- $\therefore$ You don't chase a tail
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-12 at 10.12.03 PM.png]]
			- Shows a possibility that you don't chase tails
	- This argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">invalid</mark>
- Example 4
	- All clocks tell time
	- Sun doesn't tell time
	- ===============
	- $\therefore$ Sun is not a clock
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-12 at 10.13.25 PM.png]]
	- This argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">valid</mark>
- Example 5
	- All crabs have shells
	- Some insects have shells
	- ===============
	- $\therefore$ Some insects are crabs
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-12 at 10.17.25 PM.png]]
			- There is a diagram that shows a possibility where some insects have shells and some don't but it doesn't necessarily mean that they are crabs as well. Since there is a 1 diagram that shows the conclusion to be false, the conclusion is false.
	- This argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">invalid</mark>
- Example 6
	- Some people are drivers
	- All drivers are happy
	- ===============
	- $\therefore$ Some people are happy
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-12 at 10.38.29 PM.png|300]]
	- The argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">valid</mark>
- Example 7
	- Some lawyers are judges
	- Some judges are politicians
	- ====================
	- $\therefore$ Some lawyers are politicians
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-12 at 10.42.34 PM.png]]
			- No guarantee of overlap
	- The argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">invalid</mark>
- Example 8
	- All pirates wear eye patches
	- Some sailors are not pirates
	- ====================
	- $\therefore$ Some sailors do not wear eye patches
	- Diagram

			- You cannot create a unique outcome to support the argument
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If it's possible to draw the diagrams where they don't invalidate the premises and there exists a diagram that makes the conclusion false, the premises make the conclusion false.</mark>
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-13 at 12.05.41 AM.png|150]]
				- This should be a valid diagram as well. However, since there is a a diagram that can invalidate the premises, the conclusion is invalid.
			- I believe there are still more than 2 ways to draw the above diagrams.
	- The argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">invalid</mark>.
- Example 9
	- All elephants have tusks
	- Some animals with tusks have trunks
	- ======================
	- $\therefore$ Some elephants have trunks
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-12 at 11.55.16 PM.png]]
	- The argument is invalid
- Example 10
	- Some cats catch mice
	- All cats chase rats
	- ================
	- $\therefore$ Some rat-chasers catch mice
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-13 at 12.07.02 AM.png]]
	- This argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">valid</mark>

- Use can use Euler diagrams for some arguments containing if-then statements
- Example 11
	- If I eat meat, then I am strong
	- I eat meat
	- ====================
	- $\therefore$ I am strong
	- Equivalent
		- All meat eaters are strong
		- I eat meat
		- $\therefore$ I am strong
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-13 at 12.10.37 AM.png]]
	- The argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">valid</mark>
		- This is faster than making a truth table. Truth tables don't work for things that say "some". Truth table does not have the tools that allow you to do that.
---
- Example 12
	- If tomorrow is Monday, then I celebrate
	- Tomorrow is not Monday
	- ============================
	- $\therefore$ I don't celebrate
	- Equivalent
		- All Mondays I celebrate
		- Tomorrow is not Monday
		- $\therefore$ I don't celebrate
	- Diagram
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-13 at 12.13.19 AM.png]]
			- Shows that we have 2 different possibilities where one doesn't support the conclusion so the argument is invalid.
	- The argument is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">invalid</mark>
