	- Parabola (distance from focus and directrix from any point on the curve is always equal)
		- Parts
			- Focus
			- Directrix
		- General formula: $y= ax^2 + bx + c$
		- Formula at origin: $y = ax^2$
		- General Equation
			- $x^2 = 4py$
				- p is distance from vertex to directrix and vertex to the focus
	- Circle
	- Ellipse
	- Hyperbola
		- Slope eventually becomes asymptotic to a straight line
