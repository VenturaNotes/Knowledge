	- General equation for [[sine]] and [[cosine]]
		- $y = Asin[k(\theta - b)]+c$
	- [[Amplitude]]
		- amplitude of oscillation
	- [[Periodicity factor]] (wave number)
		- $\frac {2\pi}{k}$
			- Large k means less spread out
			- Small k means more spread out the oscillations
		- When talking about physics, we talk about wave equation. When talking about math, we just talk about the sine and cosine function. They're basically the same thing
	- Shift (left/right)
		- b represents how much the wave is shifted back and forth
		- Usually smaller than period
	- Shift (up/down)
		- c represents how much the wave is shifted up or down
	- In $y = sin\theta$
		- Amplitude = 1
		- $2\pi$ is period of function
