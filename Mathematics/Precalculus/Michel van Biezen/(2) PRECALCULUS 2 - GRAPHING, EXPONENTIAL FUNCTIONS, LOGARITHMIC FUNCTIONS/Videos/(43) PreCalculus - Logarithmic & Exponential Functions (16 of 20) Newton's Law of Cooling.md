	- [[Newton's Law of cooling]]
		- T(t) = describes temperature of object when in some surroundings kept at some temperature $T_s$
		- $T_s$ = temperature of surroundings
		- $D_0$ = temperature that's the original difference between the surroundings and the object
		- k = constant associated with how fast the object cools
		- t = time
