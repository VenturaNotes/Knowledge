	- Circuit has a 100v battery
	- Resistor of 20$\ohm$ 
		- ohms
	- Conductor of 5H
		- H = henrys
	- Equation that describes current in circuit
		- $I(t) = \frac {V}{R}(1-e^{\frac {-R}{L}}{t})$
			- $\frac VR$
				- [[Ohm's law]] which is the current in the circuit at the final state
			- $\frac {-R}{L}$
				- Time constant in the circuit
		- When it reaches final value / stabilizes, current will equal 5A
			- amps
		- It would take 0.229 seconds for the current to reach 5 amps
