	- How long does it take for a charge to replenish itself when we plug in a battery
		- The rate at which a battery charges diminishes as it gets fuller.
			- In theory, it takes forever to reach 100% full charge
		- t = ? for 99% change?
	- Equation
		- $t = -0.25ln(1 - \frac {C}{C_f})$
			- t = time
			- -0.25 = negative constant
			- C = Charge that it has as a function of time.
			- $C_f$ = Final charge you want to reach
		- It would take 1.15 hours to charge a battery.
