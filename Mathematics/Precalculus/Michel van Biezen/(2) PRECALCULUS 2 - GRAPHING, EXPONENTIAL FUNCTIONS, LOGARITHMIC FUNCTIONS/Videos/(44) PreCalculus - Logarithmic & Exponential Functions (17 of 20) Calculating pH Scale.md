	- [[pH Scale]]: Indicates how acidic or basic a solution is
		- $pH = -log[H^+]$
			- $H^+$ = concentration of the hydrogen ion concentration in the solution
			- for every 1 water molecule in the solution, there would be $4.2\times 10^{-5}$ hydrogen ions
				- For every 23,800 water molecules, there would be one hydrogen ion.
		- If pH is below 7, you have an acidic solution
			- Smaller the pH number, the more acidic the solution
			- $pH = -log(4.2 \times 10^{-5})$
		- pH = 4.4 is a pretty medium acid
