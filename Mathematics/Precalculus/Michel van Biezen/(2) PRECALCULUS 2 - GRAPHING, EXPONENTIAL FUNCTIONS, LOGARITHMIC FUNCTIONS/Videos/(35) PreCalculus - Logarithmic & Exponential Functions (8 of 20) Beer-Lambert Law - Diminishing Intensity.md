	- Diminishing Intensity
	- [[Beer-Lambert Law]]
		- If light goes through material like water or glass or plexiglass, it will diminish in intensity as it goes further and further into the material
		- Equation
			- $-\frac 1kln\frac{I}{I_0}=x$
			- I = intensity at certain depth of material
			- $I_0$ = original intensity as light enters the material
			- x = distance into the material
			- k = constant that is dependent upon the material
