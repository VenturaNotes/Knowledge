	- Equation
		- $B_2 = B_1 + 20log (\frac {d_1}{d_2})$
		- $B_2$ = sound intensity for second person
		- $B_1$ = sound intensity for first person
		- $d_1$ = distance from source of first person
		- $d_2$ = distance from source of second person
	- If a person is 10 times as far away as another person, the sound and density drops by 20 decibels.
