	- [[Polar Coordinates]]
		- Coordinates are (r,$\theta$)
			- r represents the distance from the point to the origin
				- $r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$
			- $\theta$ represents the angle from the positive x-axis to the line that connects the origin to the point
				- angle is typically indicated in radians
				- $\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac yx)$
	- [[Coordinate Plane|Cartesian Coordinate System]]
		- $x = rcos\theta$
		- $y = rsin\theta$
