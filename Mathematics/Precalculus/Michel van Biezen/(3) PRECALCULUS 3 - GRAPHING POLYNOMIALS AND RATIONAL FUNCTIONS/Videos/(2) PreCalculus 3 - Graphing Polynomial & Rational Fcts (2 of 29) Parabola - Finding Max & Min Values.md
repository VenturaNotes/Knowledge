	- [[Parabola]] opening downward gives maximum value
		- Vertex of parabola
		- leading coefficient will be < 0
	- Parabola opening upward gives a minimum value 
		- Vertex of parabola
		- Leading coefficient will be > 0
	- To find vertex
		- $x = \frac{-b}{2a}$
			- Then plug-in original formula to find y value
