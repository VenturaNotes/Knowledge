	- (1) Determine orientation
		- a > 0 is upward opening parabola
			- Given minimum
		- a < 0 is downward opening parabola
			- Given maximum
	- (2) Determine Roots
		- Set y = 0
		- Using [[determinant]] tells us number of roots
			- > 0 means 2 roots
			- = 0 means 1 root
			- < 0 means 2 imaginary roots
	- (3) Determine y-intercepts
		- Set x = 0 and solve for y
