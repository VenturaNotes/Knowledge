	- Method 3: [[Synthetic Division]]
		- Can use this to slowly break the equation down as a product of binomials. Sort of like a method of factoring but using the method of synthetic division 
	- [[Rational root theorem]]
	- Maximum number of roots will equal the [[(16) PreCalculus 3 - Graphing Polynomial & Rational Fcts (16 of 29) N-th Order Polynomials - General Rules|degree of the polynomial]]
		- Therefore max roots is 5
			- (x-1) is known as a double root since it has a multiplicity of 2 (meaning graph bounces off the x-axis at that point)
