	- For the following exercises, find the x- and y-intercepts of each equation
	- For the following exercises, use the descriptions of each pair of lines given below to find the slopes of Line 1 and Line 2. Is each pair of liens parallel, perpendicular, or neither?
		- Line 1: Passes through (0, 6) and (3, -24)
		- Line 2: Passes through (-1, 19) and (8, -71)
	- 26. Write an equation for a line perpendicular to h(t) = -2t + 4 and passing through the point (-4, -1)
		- $h(t) = -2t + 4$ is function notation
		- Slopes of perpendicular lines have product -1.
	- 28. Find the point at which the line f(x) = -2x - 1 intersects the line g(x) = -x.
		- Can solve it visually or algebraically
