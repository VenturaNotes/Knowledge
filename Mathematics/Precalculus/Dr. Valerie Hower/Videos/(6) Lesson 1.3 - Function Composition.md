		- Lecture 1.3 Function Composition
		- Previous Lesson
			- Evaluating Functions
			- Domain and Range
			- Piecewise defined functions
		- Function Composition: Suppose f and g are functions
			- For each x in the domain of g such that g(x) is in the domain of f, we define the composite function:
				- $(f\circ g)(x) = f(g(x))$
					- f composed g
					- We're evaluating f at g(x)
		- Terminology
			- Inside Function: g(x)
			- Outside Function: f(x)
		- Example
			- Let $f(x) = x^2 + 3$ and $g(x) = x - 1$. Calculate and simplify $(f\circ g)(x) \text{ and } (g\circ f)(x)$
		- Note:
			- f composed g is not the same as g composed f.

		- Example
		- Evaluate each composite function below or explain why the function value is undefined
		- Typically don't want to leave fraction in the denominator
		- f(0)
			- undefined as 0 is not in the domain of f(x)

		- For each function p(x) below, find functions f(x) and g(x) such that $p(x) = (f\circ g)(x)$
			- There are multiple solutions to this

		- Suppose and find
		- When composing in each direction, if you get the same result, you get the identity function
			- It tells us that they're inverse functions
