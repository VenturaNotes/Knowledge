			- Piecewise defined functions

		- What is the function $f(x) = |x|$?
			- Domain
			- Range
		- The absolute value of x is equal to the square root of x squared
			- $|x| = \sqrt{x^2}$

		- Write f(x) as a piecewise defined function
		- Find all x-values satisfying f(x) = 5
		- No solution found for square root of -1
	- Page 4
		- Let and find x- and y- intercepts of the graph of f(x). Give your answers as ordered pairs.
			- You can never have more than y-intercept for a function because otherwise it would fail the vertical line test.
		- Remark
			- Geometrically, |x| measures the distance from x to 0 along a number line
			- For numbers x and y, |x-y| gives the distance between x and y.
		- Example:
			- Solve the inequality |x - 3| $\le$ 8. Write your answer in interval notation
			- Way 1: Use a number line
			- $|x-3| \le 8$ 
				- You want to find all x values that are within 8 of the number 3

		- Solving an inequality
			- Properties for C > 0
				- |y| < C is equivalent to -C < y < C.
				- |y| > C is equivalent to y > C or y < -C.
		- Example: Solve the inequality |x - 3| $\le$ 8. Write your answer in interval notation
			- Way 2:
		- Example: Solve the inequality |3x - 4| > 2. Write your answer in interval notation
