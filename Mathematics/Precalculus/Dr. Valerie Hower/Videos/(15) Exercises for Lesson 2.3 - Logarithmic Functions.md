	- Page 1
		- State the domain and range of the function
			- $lnx$ has domain $(0, \infty)$ and range $(-\infty, \infty)$
		- Use the properties of logarithms to expand each logarithm as much as possible
	- Page 2 (continued)
		- Condense each expression to a single logarithm using the properties of logarithms

		- Use logarithms to solve
	- Page 4 (continued)
		- $(e^x)^2 -  e^x - 132 = 0$
			- It's sort of like a quadratic, but not a polynomial because of $e^x$ 
		- $e^x$ is always positive
			- It cannot equal a negative number nor 0
