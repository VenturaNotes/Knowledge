	- Page 1
		- Determine whether the equation represents exponential growth, exponential decay, or neither
			- Neither, This is polynomial
			- Exponential growth
				- base a = 1.06 > 1
	- Page 2
		- Neither, y is not defined at 0
			- Domain of all exponential functions is $(-\infty, \infty)$
			- In this case, domain is not $\mathbb{R}$
		- Exponential Decay
			- Base < 1
		- Evaluate
