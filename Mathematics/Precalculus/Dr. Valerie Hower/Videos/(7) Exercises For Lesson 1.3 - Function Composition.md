	- Page 1
		- Given, find the following
		- Since problem does not ask to simplify, you can keep it as is.
	- Page 2
		- Find functions f(x) and g(x) so the given function can be expressed as $h(x) = f(g(x))$
		- 3 possible solutions were given to illustrate the point that there can be more than 1 solution
