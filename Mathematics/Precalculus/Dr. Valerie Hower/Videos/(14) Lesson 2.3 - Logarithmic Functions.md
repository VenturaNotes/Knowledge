		- Definition
			- For $a > 0, a \ne 1$, the base a logarithm: $y = log_a(x)$ is defined as follows
		- Example
			- $log_{49}(7) = \frac 12$
				- Read as "log base 49 of 7 equals one half"
		- Notation
	- Page 2
		- Properties
			- Last 2 are statements on inverse functions
		- Graph
			- $y = e^x$ and $y=lnx$ are inverse functions
		- Domain
		- Range

	- Example: For each function y = f(x), expand ln y using properties of logarithms
		- We are doing this because in calculus 1, there is a beautiful technique for differentiation called logarithmic differentiation. The very first step is to do exactly this
