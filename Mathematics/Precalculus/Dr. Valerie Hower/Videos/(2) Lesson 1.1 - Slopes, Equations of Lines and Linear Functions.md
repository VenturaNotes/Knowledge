	- What is the [[slope]] of a line?
		- Steepness, rate of change
		- If $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ on the line, the slope is 
	- $\frac {\Delta y}{\Delta x} =$ notation for "change in y over the change in x"
	- Interpretation
		- Start at any point on line
			- Move $\Delta x$ units along x-direction
			- Move $\Delta y$ units along y-direction
			- return to line
	- Vertical Lines
		- x = 7
		- $\Delta x = 0$
			- Undefined Slope
	- Horizontal Lines
		- y = 2
		- $\Delta y = 0$
			- Slope
			- m = 0

	- Positive Slope
		- Increasing functions
	- Negative slope
		- Decreasing functions
	- Equation of lines
		- Slope-intercept form
			- Need slope (m)
			- Intercept b
				- i.e. (0, b) is on graph
		- Point-slope form
			- need slope m
			- $(x_1,y_1)$ point on line
	- Could say that calculus is the study of rates of change (slope is first example of thinking about this)
		- Must read a graph left to right

		- Example: Find an equation of the line through points (4, 2) and (1, 3)
		- Example: Find the slope of the line with equation 6x - 3y = 12 and graph the line
	- Page 5
		- Example: Find an equation of a line (in slope-intercept form) through the point (2, -1) that is 
			- (a) [[Parallel]] to the line y = 5x + 2
			- (b) [[Perpendicular]] to the line $y = 5x + 2$
		- Linear Functions
			- $f(x) = mx + b$ (Function Notation)
