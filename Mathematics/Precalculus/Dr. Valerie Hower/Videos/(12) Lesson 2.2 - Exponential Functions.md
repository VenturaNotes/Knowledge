			- Exponents
		- $f(x) = a^x; \text{ base } a > 0, a \ne 1$

			- Base: a > 1
				- Exponential growth
			- Base: 0 < a < 1
				- Exponential decay
		- Notice
			- For a > 1, as x grows without bound.
				- $a^x$ grows without bound
			- For 0 < a < 1, as x grows without bound.
				- $a^x$ decreases and approaches 0

		- Evaluate
		- Is it an exponential function
			- $\sqrt{9^x}$ is an exponential function because we had to use properties of exponents to find that it has a base of 3
			- $(-5)^x$ is not an exponential function because the domain of f(x) is not ($-\infty, \infty)$
				- f($\frac 12$) would return an undefined value
					- $\frac 12$ is not in domain of f

		- Solving exponential equations
			- For base a > 0, a $\ne$ 1: $a^x$ = $a^y$ is equivalent to x = y
				- With the same base, you can equate exponents
			- Example: Solve for x:
