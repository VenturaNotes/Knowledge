		- Previous Lesson
			- Slope (rate of change) of a line
			- Equations of lines
			- LInear functions: f(x) = mx + b
		- Using Calculus, we can measure the rate of change of a function. (More on this later.)
		- Recall: A function is a rule f that assigns to each x in the domain a unique number f(x).
			- Domain: Set of inputs (x-values) or possible values of the independent variable.
			- Range: Set of outputs (y-values) or possible values of the dependent variable.
		- Vertical line test: A graph is function provided no vertical line intersects graph more than one time.

		- Remarks
			- All non-vertical lines yield linear functions
				- The domain of a linear function f(x) = mx + b is all real numbers $(-\infty, \infty)$
		- Interval Notation: Suppose a, b are numbers with a < b
			- Open interval: $(a,b)$
			- Closed interval $[a,b]$
			- Half-open intervals
				- $(a, b]$
				- $[a, b]$
			- Infinite Intervals (will never have a closed interval for $\infty$)
				- $(-\infty, \infty)$
					- all real numbers
				- $(a, \infty)$
				- $[a, \infty]$
				- $(-\infty, a)$
				- $(-\infty, a]$

		- Example: Find the domain of each function using interval notation
			- Pay attention to square roots and denominators
			- All polynomials have a domain of all real numbers

		- Example: For each function graphed, find its domain and range in interval notation. Evaluate f(-1)
			- $(-\infty, 3]$ 
				- can be read as all real number less than or equal to y=3
