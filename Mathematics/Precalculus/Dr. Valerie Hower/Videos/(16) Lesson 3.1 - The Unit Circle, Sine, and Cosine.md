		- In calculus, we typically use [[Radian|Radians]] to measure angles
		- Definition: An angle is in standard position provided the vertex is at the origin (0, 0) and its initial side lies along the positive x-axis
			- Definition: The radian measure of an angle $\theta$ is the arc-length along the unit circle traced out by $\theta$ in standard position
				- Positive Angle
					- Counterclockwise
				- Negative Angle
					- Clockwiseo

		- Radians and the Unit Circle
			- Question: What is the measure of the angle that is one full circle (counterclockwise)?
				- Circumference of unit circle: $2\pi * 1 = 2\pi$ 
			- 4 quadrants
				- Quadrant 1
				- Quadrant 2
				- Quadrant 3
				- Quadrant 4

		- Trigonometric Functions: cosine and sine
		- For an angle $\theta$ in standard position, its terminal side intersects the unit circle at a point (x, y)
		- Definition: We define cosine and sine of $\theta$ 
			- cos$\theta$ = x
			- sin$\theta$ = y
			- Think of computer science (CS) to know position in coordinate
		- Note: (x, y) on the unit circle means $x^2 + y^2 = 1$
			- $cos^2\theta + sin^2\theta = 1$ is the most important [[Trigonometric Identities|Trigonometric Identity]]
		- We need to memorize the sin and cos values of the 3 angles in each quadrant as well the angles on the x and y axes.
		- Able to derive $cos\frac {\pi}{4}$ with the identity above
			- If you're in quadrant I, you use the positive square root

		- Equilateral triangle made so we know the y-value for sin$\frac{\pi}{6}$ is $\frac 12$ 
			- Can use geometry and $cos^2\theta + sin^2\theta = 1$ to figure out when $\theta$ = 0, $\frac {\pi}{6}$, $\frac {\pi}{4}$, $\frac{\pi}{3}$ $\frac{\pi}{2}$, $\pi$, $\frac {3\pi}{2}$, $2\pi$ 
		- For other angles: we use
			- A [[reference angle]]
			- Sign of x- and y-coordinates in given quadrant
