	- Strategy for solving problems involving maximizing or minimizing quadratic functions
		- (1) Read the problem carefully and decide which quantity is to be maximized or minimized
		- (2) Use the conditions of the problem to express the quantity as a function in one variable
		- (3) Rewrite the function in the form $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
		- (4) Calculate $-\frac {b}{2a}.$ 
			- If $a > 0$, f has a minimum at $x = \frac {-b}{2a}$. This minimum value is $f(-\frac{b}{2a})$.
			- If $a < 0$, f has a maximum at $x = \frac {-b}{2a}$. This minimum value is $f(-\frac{b}{2a})$.
		- (5) Answer the question posed in the problem
	- Check Point 6
		- Among all pairs of numbers whose difference is 8, find a pair whose product is as small as possible. What is the minimum product?
			- Pair of numbers is 4 and -4
			- Minimum product is -16

	- Check Point 7
		- You have 120 feet of fencing to enclose a rectangular region. Find the dimensions of the rectangle that maximize the enclosed area. What is the maximum area?
			- L = 30 units
			- W = 30 units
			- Max area is 900 $\text{units}^2$
