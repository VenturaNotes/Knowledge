	- (A) Consider $f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$
		- Highest part of graph is maximum point (vertex)
			- a < 0
		- Lowest part of graph is lowest point (vertex)
			- a > 0
		- (1) [[Vertex]] - min/max of the graph
			- $x_v = \frac {-b}{2a}$ (x-coordinate)
				- Tells us where or when the maximum or minimum value occurs
				- What value will maximize the volume of a box, we don't care what the volume is. We just care when that maximum occurs 
			- $y_v =f(x_v)$ (y-coordinate) wh
				- Tells us what the maximum or minimum actually is
				- If we want to minimize our expenses and I'm interested in what is that minimum expense, that is asking for the y-coordinate

		- Redid problem #3. Seems to be impossible to minimize
	- (B) Min/Max Problems
		- (1) Find two numbers whose sum is 18 and whose product is a maximum
		- (2) A farmer is building a fence along a barn with two sections as shown. He has 100ft of fencing, what size would give the maximum area?
		- (3) Minimize $S = -3x^2 + 2xy + 4y^2$ given $2x-5y = -9$
			- You could solve for x or y. Both methods would give the same answer
			- The given is a constraint
			- This problem does not seem possible. It's impossible to minimize since a < 0 so we'll try to [maximize it](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=maximize+s+%3D+-3%28x%29%5E2+%2B+2%28x%29%28y%29+%2B+4y%5E2+given+2x-5y+%3D+-9)

	- 100 tickets sold to a concert if the cost is \$3/ticket. For every 10$\textcent$ increase in price, it is estimated one customer would be lost. What should be charged to maximize revenue?
		- For revenue generated, it's (price)(number sold)
