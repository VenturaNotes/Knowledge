	- Equations: |a| = 3
	- (1) Isolate the absolute value, then consider $\pm$

	- Inequalities
	- Absolute value is distance from 0
	- |a| < 2
		- Distance from zero is less than 2
	- Never distribute through absolute value
		- Ex: 2|x + 1|

	- (2) |a| > 2
		- Distance from zero is more than 2

	- (3) Isolate absolute value, then decide
		- (a) |x| > n: greatOR is OR U
		- (b) |x| < n: less is tripartite -n < x < n
