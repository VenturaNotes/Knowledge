	- (A) New numbers (not fake) to solve new problems
		- (1) x + 5 = 2
			- For x = -3 $\to$ Chinese created negative numbers
		- (2) 3x = 5
			- x = $\frac {5}{3}$ $\to$ Egyptian created fractions
		- (3) $x^2 = 7$
			- x = $\sqrt{7}$ $\to$ Greeks created irrational numbers
		- (4) $x^2 = -1$ 
			- x = $\sqrt{-1}$ = i $\to$ Created complex numbers
				- Useful to describe current flow and electrical circuits. Engineers use these type of problems

	- Examples
- ![[Pasted image 20230712004951.png]]
	- (C) Add/Subtract - treat $i$ like a variable
		- Parentheses does not mean multiply. It just means we have a group. If there is nothing between the parentheses, then we multiply

	- (D) Multiply - treat i like a variable ($i^2 = -1$)
		- Put real part first and then part with "$i$" second
		- When multiplying complex conjugates, we can square both parts and add
			- $(a+bi)(a-bi) = a^2 + b^2$

	- (E) Divide: no $\sqrt{}$ in denominator (i = $\sqrt{-1}$)
		- Multiply by conjugate
