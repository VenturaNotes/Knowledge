	- [[Transformation]] of basic functions
	- (A) The [[functions]]
		- (1) [[Linear]]: f(x) = x
			- (1, 1)
			- (0, 0)
			- (-1, -1)
		- (2) [[Absolute value]]: f(x) = |x|
			- (-1,1)
			- (0,0)
			- (1,1)
		- (3) [[Quadratic]]: f(x) = $x^2$
			- (-1, 1)
			- (0, 0)
			- (1, 1)
		- (4) [[Cubic]]: $f(x) = x^3$
			- (-1, -1)
			- (0,0)
			- (1,1)
		- (5) [[Reciprocal]]: f(x) = $\frac 1x$
			- (-1, -1)
			- (0, 0) (asymptotes meet here)
			- (1, 1)
		- (6) [[Inverse Square]]: $f(x) = \frac {1}{x^2}$
			- (-1, 1)
			- (0,0) (asymptotes meet here)
			- (1, 1)
	- Need to have the graphs memorized
		- How they behave
		- What their shape is 
		- Any asymptotes
		- Key points

	- Examples - graph
		- x just standing alone is a linear function

	- The reciprocal function represents the f. Whatever is inside the reciprocal goes inside the function. Whatever is outside the reciprocal goes outside the function
	- (0,0) on the [[reciprocal]] function is the intersection of the asymptotes. It's not part of the graphs. It's where the asymptotes cross.
		- Same for inverse square

	- [[Absolute value]] of functions:
		- Graph inside absolute value
		- Make negative positive (below x-axis moves above)
		- Graph outside absolute value
	- Graph preliminary graph first
