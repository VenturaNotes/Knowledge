	- [[Radical|Radicals]]
		- Only take even roots of non-negative numbers
		- When index is even and the radicand is negative, we say that it is a non-real answer
	- Simplify radicals: 
		- Find prime factorization of number and divide exponents by index
	- [[Rationalize the denominator]]
		- No radicals in denominator
		- Multiply by missing factors on top & bottom
	- Add/subtract radicals - combine like terms / radical
	- Radical equations
		- Get a radical alone & clear with an exponent (check answers in even radicals)
