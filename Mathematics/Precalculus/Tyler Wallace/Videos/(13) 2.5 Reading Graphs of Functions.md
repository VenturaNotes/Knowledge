	- (A) Vocabulary
		- (1) [[Domain (Math)|domain]]: input values (x)
			- [[Range]]: output values (y)
		- (2) [[Positive]]: y > 0 or above x-axis
			- [[Negative]]: y  < 0 or below x-axis
		- (3) [[Increasing]]: going "up" Left to Right
			- [[Decreasing]]: going "down" Left to Right
		- (4) [[Vertical asymptote]]: line the graph approaches but never crosses
			- Graph will never cross a vertical asymptote
		- (5) Limits at infinity ([[Horizontal asymptote|Horizontal Asymptotes]]): at "edge" graph approaching
			- Horizontal asymptotes only describing what happens at the extremes (at the edges. Not the middle. Sometimes in the middle, it will cross the horizontal asymptote)

	- (B) Examples
		- At the asymptote, the graph is neither positive nor negative
		- Maximum
		- Minimum
		- P(0) = -2
		- When p(x) = 0
		- When p(x) = 3
		- X approaches -2
		- X approaches $\infty$
