	- [[inverse function|Inverse Functions]]: undo something that has been done
		- (1) To check if functions are inverses, compose the functions (=x)
- ![[Screenshot 2023-07-13 at 2.07.17 AM.png]]
	- Find inverse: swap x & y = f(x)

	- (C) Make inverse a function
		- (1) [[injection|one-to-one]] $\to$ has one input for each output (horizontal line test)
		- (2) Problem: $x^2 + x -2$
		- (3) Solution: limit domain so it is one-to-one
		- (4) Choices: When restricting the domain
			- Multiple ways of doing it
			- Answer must pass the vertical line test

	- (D) Is it 1-1? Find the inverse function (restrict the domain)
		- Can check if function passes the horizontal line test by using graphing calculator
			- Get rid of asymptotes by going to Mode $\to$ dotted (instead of connected)
