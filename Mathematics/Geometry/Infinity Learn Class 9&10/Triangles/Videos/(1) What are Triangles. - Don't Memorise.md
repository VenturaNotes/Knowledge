	- Create a closed figure from 3 line segments (this creates a triangle)
	- 3 points of triangle called vertices
		- Each point is a vertex
			- In a closed-figure, it's a point at which 2 segments meet
	- To name triangle, name the vertices so you have $\triangle ABC$
		- $\triangle BAC$ is also valid but try to follow alphabetical order when you can
	- Triangle has
		- Vertices
			- A, B, and C
		- Angles
			- Formed when 2 segments meet
			- 3 angles - $\angle A, \angle B, \angle C$ 
		- Sides
			- 3 sides (or segments) - AB, BC, CA
	- A triangle is basically a 3-sided closed figure with 3 angles in its interiors
		- A triangle has 3 sides
	- BC is the side opposite of vertex A, AC is the side opposite vertex B, and AB is the side opposite vertex C
	- A triangular shape is considered to be extremely stable in the field of architecture
		- Tip of toy is sharp and toy won't break easily if you try to attack the sides of the pyramid
		- Making a rectangle with 3 triangles will make it more stable
		- Most bridges will have a triangular structure (which helps withstand the heavy downward force of the weights crossing the bridge)
		- Snow would slide down slopes of house with a triangular roof
		- Stairs is a triangular shape which makes it easier to climb floors rather than attempting to move up vertically.
		- The triangle is the single-most important shape in engineering
