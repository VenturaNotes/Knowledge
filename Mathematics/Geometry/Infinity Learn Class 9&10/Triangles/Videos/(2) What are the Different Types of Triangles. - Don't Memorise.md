	- Classification
		- Lengths of sides
			- Equilateral Triangles - All sides equal
				- Placing same mark on each side of triangle tells you that all sides of the triangle are equal in length
				- "Equi" is equal and "lateral" is side
			- Isosceles Triangles - Two Sides Equal
				- Two sides equal
			- Scalene Triangle - No Two Sides Equal
				- Length of each side is different from one another
		- Angles
			- Review
				- <90$\degree$- Acute
				- = 90$\degree$ - Right Angle
				- > 90$\degree$ - Obtuse
			- Acute Triangle - All angles are acute
			- Right Triangle (right angled triangle) - One angle $90\degree$  
				- A triangle can't have two right angles because the sum of its three angles would be more than 180$\degree$ which is impossible [^1]
			- Obtuse Triangle - One angle is obtuse
