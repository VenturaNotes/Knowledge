	- When saying "secure the perimeter", it just means to guard or enclose the boundary of an area so no one gets in or out.
	- [[Perimeter]]: The distance around a shape or figure
		- The sum of the side lengths
	- One of the earliest mathematical necessities (farmers needed to know material they needed to enclose and guard their land of animals and crops)
	- [[Irregular pentagon]]
	- How far is it to walk around the object?
	- When we don't know some side lengths, we can usually calculate them somehow
		- Rectangles have a length and width
	- [[Perimeter]] of [[rectangle]]
		- P = 2l + 2w
	- [[Perimeter]] of [[square]]
		- P = 4s 
	- Perimeter of [[triangle]]
		- P = a + b + c
			- We can calculate a missing side length by using the [[Pythagorean theorem]]
	- Perimeter
		- Sum of the side lengths
		- Is easy to calculate for shapes made of straight lines
		- Get trickier when curvature is involved (will need calculus for this)

	- Let's learn about circles next!
	- Comprehension!
		- (1) What is the perimeter of a rectangle with a width of 5 and a length of 12?
		- (2) What is the perimeter of a square with a side length of 4.3?
		- What is the perimeter of a right triangle with legs of length 5 and 12?
