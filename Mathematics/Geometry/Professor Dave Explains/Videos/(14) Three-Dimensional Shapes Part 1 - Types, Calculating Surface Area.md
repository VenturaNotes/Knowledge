	- From past tutorials, learned about (these are 2D objects)
		- Line
		- Polygon
		- Circle
	- All real objects are three-dimensional
		- Even a piece of paper has some thickness
		- Let's look at some three-dimensional shapes right now
	- Types of [[polyhedrons]]/polyhedra
		- A polyhedron is a three-dimensional object with flat surfaces called [[faces]]
			- Each face of a polyhedron is a [[polygons|polygon]] (square for cube)
			- Where two faces meet and share a side is an [[edge]]
			- Any point where three or more edges meet is a [[vertex]]
	- Types of polyhedra
		- [[prism]]
			- Have two congruent parallel bases
			- Prisms have sides that are [[parallelograms]]
				- rectangles qualify as parallelograms
		- [[Rectangular prism]]
			- A prism is named for the shape of its bases

	- Pentagonal prism
	- Hexagonal prism
	- [[cylinder|cylinders]] have circular bases
		- Not considered polyhedra (sides are not polygons)
	- [[Pyramids]] have only one base
		- We have triangles that come together at a point 
	- [[Square pyramid]]
		- A pyramid is named for the shape of its base.
	- [[Triangular pyramid]]
	- [[Pentagonal pyramid]]
	- [[Cones]] have a circular base
		- not polyhedra since the faces are not polygons
	- Calculating the [[surface area]]
		- We can calculate the total area of the faces
			- How much wrapping paper do we need to just barely wrap up this cube?
	- A [[rectangular prism]] has 6 sides
		- (3 sets of identical sides)
		- Surface area = sum of areas of each face
- ![[Screenshot 2023-10-30 at 9.32.28 PM.png]]
	- [[Pyramids|pyramid]]
		- Surface area = (area of square) + 4(area of triangle)
	- [[Cylinder]]
		- Surface area = 2(area of a circle) + (area of a rectangle)
	- A [[sphere]] is the set of all points in space that are equidistant from a central point
		- Surface area = 4$\pi$$r^2$ 
	- Comprehension!
		- What is the surface area of a rectangular prism with dimensions of 3m by 5m by 8m?
			- $158m^2$ 
		- What is the surface area of a square pyramid that has a base with a side length of 10 m and triangular faces with heights of 6m?
			- $220m^2$ 
		- What is the surface area of a cylinder that has bases with a radius of 4cm and a height of 12cm?
			- 16$\pi$ + 16$\pi$  + 96$\pi$ = $128\pi cm^2$
