	- We refer geometry in Ancient Greece as [[Euclidian Geometry]]
		- Built upon Pythagoras
	- Euclidian Geometry
		- A set of axioms and postulates which a variety of theorems can be derived.
	- Constructs in Euclidian Geometry
		- [[Point]]
			- Location in space
			- Zero-dimensional
			- the dot that represents the point is infinitely larger than the point itself
		- [[Line]]
			- One-dimensional
			- Two points define a line
			- A line extends infinitely in both directions
				- A [[ray]] extends infinitely in one direction
				- A [[line segment]] is finite
		- [[Plane]]
			- Two-dimensional
			- Three points define a plane
		- [[Space]]
			- Three-dimensional
	- These figures are idealized concepts and a true plane can't exist
		- Even a piece of paper has some thickness

	- Lines have no endpoints
	- Rays have one [[endpoint]]
	- Line segments have two endpoints
	- [[line segment|line segments]] connect to form different shapes
		- [[Coterminal rays]] create [[Angle|Angles]]
	- Let's learn all about angles next!
