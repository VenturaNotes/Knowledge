	- Triangles have special lines like [[bisector|bisectors]] and special points like [[circumcenter|circumcenters]]
	- A [[midsegment]] joins the midpoints of two sides
		- All triangles have 3 midsegments
		- these lines form the [[midsegment triangle]]
		- these vertices divide each side in half
	- The [[triangle midsegment theorem]]
		- States that each midsegment is parallel to a side and half its length
		- We can do algebra with this theorem
