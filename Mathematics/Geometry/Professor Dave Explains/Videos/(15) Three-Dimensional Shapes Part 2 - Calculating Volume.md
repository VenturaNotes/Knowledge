	- 2D surface areas cover 3D objects
		- How much space does this contain?
	- Calculating [[volume]]
		- Area = (side length)(side length)
		- Volume = (face area)(side length)
			- Can get a [[cube]]
				- This is a [[prism]] made of squares
		- Area of a square = $(side)^2$
		- Volume of a cube = $(side)^3$ 
	- It would take 8 [[cubic units]] to fill larger cube ($2*2*2 = 8$)
	- [[Rectangular prism]]
		- Volume = $length*width*height$ 
		- Volume = (base)(height)
	- [[Triangular prism]]
		- Volume = (base)(height)
	- [[Cylinder]]
		- Volume = (base)(height)
	- [[Pyramids|pyramid]]
		- Volume = $\frac 13 (base)(height)$

	- Alternate way of calculating volume of pyramid
	- [[Cone]]: Works just like pyramids
		- Volume = $\frac 13 (base)(height)$ 
	- [[Sphere]]
		- Volume = $\frac 43 \pi r^3$ 
	- Most [[regular shapes]] shown for reliable equations
	- Calculating the volume of [[irregular shapes]] may require using calculus
	- Comprehension
		- (1) What is the volume of a rectangular prism with dimensions of 3m by 5 m by 8m?
			- $120m^3$ 
		- (2) What is the volume of a square pyramid that has a base with a side length of 10 m and a height of 6m?
			- $200m^3$ 
		- (3) What is the volume of a cylinder that has bases with a radius of 4cm and a height of 12cm?
			- $16\pi$ * $12cm$ = $192cm^3$
