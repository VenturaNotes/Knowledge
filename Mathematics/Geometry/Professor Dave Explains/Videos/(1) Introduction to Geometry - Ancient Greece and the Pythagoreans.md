	- Ancient Greece revolutionized
		- Philosophy
		- Government
		- Mathematics
	- Important figures
		- [[Aristotle]]
		- [[Plato]]
		- [[Socrates]]
		- [[Ptolemy]]
		- [[Euclid]]
		- [[Pythagoras]]
			- His work influenced great thinkers like Plato and therefore all of western civilization
			- Born $\approx$ 580 BC and died $\approx$ 500 BC
			- Early branch of mathematics now called geometry was derived largely from drawing pictures in the sand. One of the oldest topics in math
			- Had a club surrounding his beliefs about numbers. It was a math cult. It's members were called Pythagoreans
				- They thought orbital radii had integer ratios like the consonant musical intervals
				- Sadly there is no space symphony
				- Planets are distributed about the solar system randomly just like every other planetary system we can see in our galaxy
			- Their work remains relevant (Pythagoras and Euclid)
	- Great thinkers would draw shapes like circles, rectangles, and triangles and try to understand the characteristics of these perfect forms
	- Mathematics
		- The study of questions that have completely objective answers.
			- Answers to these kinds of questions are inarguably true
				- Sum of 2 angles
				- Ratio of side lengths on a triangle 
	- Mathematics
		- Geometrical figures
		- Things can be proven
	- Natural Philosophy
		- Crude physical world
		- Nothing can be proven
	- Geometry we learn today in high school is not very different than the geometry of that ancient time
	- Let's learn about shapes, angles, axioms and more!
