	- [[triangle|triangles]] have three sides
	- What are the types of triangles?
	- Classification of triangles
		- [[Acute triangles]]
			- Have all acute angles
		- [[Obtuse triangles]]
			- Have one obtuse angle
		- [[Right Triangle|right triangles]]
			- Have one right angle
	- The angles of any triangle will always add up to 180$\degree$ 
	- Triangles can only have one obtuse or right triangle
		- $90\degree$ + $90\degree$ = nothing left for the third angle!
		- $a + b + c = 180\degree$ 
	- Triangles can be classified by their side lengths as well
		- [[Scalene triangle]] has all sides of different length
		- An [[Isosceles triangle]] has two sides of the same length
			- Therefore, has two angles of the same measure (specifically, the two angles that are opposite of the two identical sides)
		- An [[equilateral triangle]] has all sides of the same length and therefore all angles of the same measure
			- Each angle is $60\degree$ 
		- These are all the triangles that exist
			- 3 equal sides, two equal sides, or no equal sides
	- Let's look at special [[Right Triangle|right triangles]]
		- [[45-45-90 triangle]]
			- Legs = x
			- Hypotenuse = x$\sqrt{2}$ 
		- [[30-60-90 triangle]]
			- leg 1 = x
			- leg 2 = x$\sqrt{3}$ 
			- hypotenuse = 2x
	- [[Geometry]] will require this type of logic
		- Just follow the rules of
			- angle relationships
			- shape congruence
			- parallel lines
	- Comprehension (fill in the blanks)
		- Triangles with all three sides of the same length are called equilateral triangles
		- Triangles with two sides of the same length are called isosceles triangles.
		- Triangles with all three sides of different lengths are called scalene triangles
		- The angles of a triangle add up to 180$\degree$
		- A triangle can have at most one angle of $90\degree$ or more.
