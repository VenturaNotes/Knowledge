	- We know how to calculate one-dimensional lengths
	- We must learn to calculate two-dimensional areas
		- The area of an object is the amount of surface it covers
		- Area will be expressed in square units
	- How much surface is covered by the square?
		- Units will be manipulated just like algebraic variables
	- [[Area]] of a [[square]]
		- $(\text{side length})^2$ 
	- Area of a [[rectangle]]
		- (Length)(Width)
	- Area of a parallelogram
		- (base)(height)
	- A rectangle can be split into two triangles
		- Each triangle is half of the rectangle
	- Area of [[triangle]]
		- $\frac {1}{2}(base)(height)$ 
		- Works whether the triangle is a right triangle or not
	- Area of a [[Trapezoids|trapezoid]]
		- $\frac 12 (height)(base_1 + base_2)$ 
	- We can find the area of [[irregular shapes]]
		- We can break shapes into simpler ones

	- Errata
		- Units are not squared for comprehension question in image
	- Area of [[circle]]
		- Area = $\pi r^2$ 
	- Area = rectangle + semicircle
	- [[Area formulas]]
		- square = $s^2$
		- rectangle = (L)(W)
		- parallelogram = (b)(h)
		- triangle = $\frac 12(b)(h)$
		- trapezoid = $\frac {1}{2}(h)(b_1 + b_2)$
		- circle = $\pi r^2$ 
	- Checking comprehension!
		- What is the area of a triangle with a base of 10cm and a height of 12cm?
			- $60cm^2$ 
		- What is the area of a trapezoid with bases of 3 m and 7 m, and a height of 5 m?
			- $25m^2$ 
		- What is the area of a parallelogram with a base of 20 mm and a height of 6 mm
			- $120mm^2$
