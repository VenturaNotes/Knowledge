	- We need to learn just one more theorem
	- [[Pythagorean theorem]]
		- The theorem was likely discovered prior to ancient Greece
	- The Pythagorean Theorem
		- Any right triangle has one right angle
		- The sides that form the right angle are called the legs of the triangle
		- The side opposite the right angle is called the hypotenuse of the triangle
		- The sum of the squares of the legs equals the square of the hypotenuse
		- Given two sides we can calculate the third
			- Side lengths can only be positive
		- Given two sides, we can calculate the third
		- The answers won't always be integers
