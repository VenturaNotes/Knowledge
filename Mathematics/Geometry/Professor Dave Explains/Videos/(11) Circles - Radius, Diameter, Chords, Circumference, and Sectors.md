	- [[Polygons]]
		- Shapes made of line segments
	- Some shapes have curvature
		- [[Circle]]
			- A circle is the set of all points that are some fixed distance from a central point
			- There are no side lengths or angles to define
	- This circle represents all the points that are five cm away from this point
	- The distance from the center to any point on the circle is called the [[radius]] of the circle
		- Any such line segment is a radius of the circle
	- A line segment with both ends on the circle is called a [[chord]]
		- A chord that passes through the center is a [[diameter]]
			- This is always twice the length of a radius
	- A part of a circle is called an [[arc]]
		- The distance around the circle is called the [[circumference]]
			- $C = \pi d$  
				- We can estimate $\pi$ as 3.14
	- Important equations of a circle
		- d = 2r
			- The diameter is twice the radius
		- c = $\pi$ d
			- The circumference is equal to the diameter multiplied by $\pi$

	- [[Sector]]
		- If we draw several radii on one circle, we will demarcate several sectors of that circle
	- A sector is a section of a circle that is enclosed by two radii
		- Within sector, there is a central angle
		- The angles of all the sectors in a circle will always add up to 360$\degree$ 
	- Comprehension! (fill in the blanks)
		- A line segment with both endpoints somewhere on the circle is a chord
		- The distance from the center to any point on the circle is the radius
		- The perimeter of a circle is called its circumference
