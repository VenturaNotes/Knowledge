	- Defining angles as a concept
	- The door and wall form an angle
		- This angle won't depend on the [[Dimension|dimensions]] of the door
	- [[Vertex]]
		- 2 rays that start at the same point
	- [[Angle]]
		- Distance between rays
		- Moving one ray makes different angles
		- Right now, we will measure angles in [[degrees]]
	- There are 360$\degree$ in a [[circle]]
	- Identifying types of angles
		- Angles < 90$\degree$
			- [[acute angle]]
		- Angle = 90$\degree$
			- [[Right angle]]
		- $90\degree$  < angle < $180\degree$ 
			- [[Obtuse angle]]
	- How are these angles related?
		- [[Vertical angles]] are equal
			- Geometry is all about proofs!
		- These adjacent angles are [[supplementary]] and must therefore add up to 180$\degree$ 
		- These angles are complementary and must therefore add up to 90$\degree$

	- Identifying types of angles
		- These kinds of rules allow us to assign values to unknown angles
	- Relationships between lines
		- Lines that cross at a right angle are [[perpendicular]]
		- [[Coplanar lines]] that never cross are [[parallel]]
	- Angles generated by [[transversals]]
		- [[Interior angles]]
		- [[Exterior angles]]
		- There are [[vertical angles]]
		- [[Alternate interior angles]]
			- [[Alternate Interior Angle Theorem|alternate interior angles theorem]] states that alternate interior angles are equal
		- [[alternate exterior angles]]
			- [[alternate exterior angles theorem]] states that alternate exterior angles are equal
		- [[Same side interior angles theorem]]
			- Tells us that interior angles on the same side of the transversal are [[supplementary]]
		- [[Corresponding angles]]: same position with respect to one another

	- Algebra with geometric figures
		- [[Complementary angles]] add up to 90$\degree$ 
	- Let's look at [[shapes]] next!
		- These are made of [[line segment|line segments]]
		- No shape made of line segments can have one side
		- No shape made of line segments can have two sides
		- Any shape made of line segments has at least three sides
			- Simplest shape is called a [[triangle]]
		- check for comprehension
