	- Geometry is concerned with proofs
	- In the physical world, things can only be consistent beyond reasonable doubt
	- Euclid's proof of the [[pythagorean theorem]]
	- Sometimes triangles have certain relationships
		- We may need to prove that two triangles are either
			- [[similar]] 
				- They have precisely the same shape but different sizes
			- [[congruent]]
				- They are absolutely identical
	- Demonstrating triangle similarity
		- These two triangles must be [[similar]] if
			- The [[corresponding sides]] are [[proportional]]
			- or the [[corresponding angles]] are identical
	- Demonstrating [[triangle congruence]]
		- [[Side-Side-Side|SSS Theorem]]
			- If the three sides of one triangle are equal to the three sides of another: those triangles must be [[congruent]]
			- Three sides of particular lengths can only make one specific triangle
		- [[SAS Theorem]]
			- If two sides of one triangle and the angle between them match the sides and included angle of another: those triangles must be congruent
			- If we have two sides and an angle, there is only one possible third side
		- [[Hypotenuse-leg theorem]]
			- If the hypotenuse and one leg of two right triangles are identical: those triangles must be congruent
		- [[ASA Theorem]]
			- If two angles of one triangle and the side between them match the angles and included side of another: those triangles must be congruent
		- [[AAS Theorem]]
			- If two angles of one triangle and a non-included side match the angles and non-included side of another: those triangles must be congruent

	- Proving [[similarity]]
		- Proportional sides

		- AAS Theorem
	- Comprehension! (fill in the blanks)
		- To prove that two triangles are similar, one must show that all three sides are proportional or that all three angles are identical
		- List five theorems that can be used to prove that two triangles are congruent
