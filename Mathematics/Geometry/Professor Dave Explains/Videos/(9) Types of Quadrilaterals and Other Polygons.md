	- [[triangle|triangles]] have three sides
	- Quadrilaterals have fours sides
		- Have 4 angles
		- Can be of different types
	- Types of [[quadrilaterals]]
		- [[Trapezoids]] have precisely one pair of parallel sides
			- Precisely one pair of nonparallel sides
		- [[Kites]] have two pairs of congruent consecutive sides
			- Kites have diagonals that are perpendicular
		- Opposite sides are parallel and congruent
			- $\therefore$ opposite angles are congruent
		- [[Parallelograms]] have
			- Two sets of parallel and congruent sides. Two sets of congruent angles
			- The diagonals of a parallelogram always bisect one another
		- [[Rhombus]]
			- Any parallelogram that has four congruent sides is a rhombus
		- [[Rectangle]]
			- Any parallelogram that has four congruent angles is a rectangle

	- Types of quadrilaterals (continued)
		- [[Square]]
			- Any parallelogram that has four congruent sides and four congruent angles is a square
	- This shape qualifies as a 
		- [[square]]
		- [[rectangle]]
		- [[rhombus]]
		- [[Parallelograms|parallelogram]]
		- [[quadrilaterals|quadrilateral]]
	- A square is a rectangle. A rectangle is not necessarily a square
		- This is a [[syllogism]] (deductive reasoning)
	- Quadrilaterals have four sides
	- [[polygons]] are made of three or more line segments
		- Triangles and quadrilaterals are technically polygons but since we have specific names for those, we typically refer to polygons for shapes with 5 sides or more
	- Circles and other curved shapes are not polygons
	- Types of [[polygons]]
		- Prefixes (these tell us the number of sides and angles that are in a polygon)
			- pent = 5
			- hex = 6
			- hept = 7
			- oct = 8
			- non = 9
			- dec = 10

	- Names of polygons
		- Pentagon
		- Hexagon
		- Heptagon
		- Octagon
		- Nonagon
		- Decagon
	- This is a [[pentagon]] because it has five sides
	- This is a [[regular pentagon]] because all the sides and angles are equal
	- Regular octagon would be a stop sign
	- A polygon of a particular type will have angles that add up to a specific value
		- Triangle: 180 degrees
		- Quadrilateral: 360 degrees
		- Pentagon: 540 degrees
		- Hexagon: 720 degrees
	- Polygons contain two fewer triangles than the number of sides in the shape
		- Example one
			- 7 sides
			- 5 triangles
			- $900 \degree$ 
		- Example two
			- 8 sides
			- 6 triangles
			- $1080\degree$ 
	- Comprehension (fill in the blanks)
		- Any polygon with four sides is a quadrilateral
		- Any quadrilateral with precisely one set of parallel sides is a trapezoid
		- Any quadrilateral with four congruent angles is a rectangle
		- Any polygon with six sides is a hexagon
		- Any polygon with six congruent sides and angles is a regular hexagon
