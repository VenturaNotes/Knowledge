	- Special lines pertaining to triangles
	- [[Perpendicular bisector]]
		- Line perpendicular to one of the sides of a triangle and cuts that side into two line segments of equal length
		- Any point on the [[bisector]] must be equidistant from the endpoints of these line segments
			- If the bisector coincides with the other two sides, then the two sides must be equal and we have a [[right triangle]]
			- Then the other two sides must be equal and we have a [[right angle]]
				- The smaller triangles are congruent
	- [[angle bisector|angle bisectors]]
		- This line cuts this angle in half
		- Any point on the angle bisector will be equidistant from the two other lines
	- The circumference of a triangle
		- Let's draw three perpendicular bisectors
		- These bisectors meet at the [[circumcenter]]
			- An [[Acute triangles|acute triangle]] has its circumcenter inside the triangle

	- The circumference of a triangle (continued)
		- An [[Obtuse triangles|obtuse triangle]] has its circumcenter outside the triangle
		- A [[right triangle]] has its circumcenter on the triangle
		- The distance to each side is different
		- The distance to each vertex is the same
		- The circumcenter is the center of the circle that [[circumscribes]] the triangle
			- This is the circle that contains all three vertices of the triangle
	- The [[Incenter]] of a triangle
		- the incenter is where the [[angle bisector|angle bisectors]] meet
		- The incenter is always inside the triangle
		- The incenter is equidistant from the three sides
		- The incenter is center of the circle that is [[inscribed]] in the triangle
			- This is the circle that intersects each side of the triangle at precisely one point

	- Geometrical proofs
		- We can use [[Theorem|Theorems]] and [[postulate|postulates]] to prove
			- angle measures
			- side lengths
			- similarity/congruence
			- and more!
	- The medians of a triangle
		- [[Medians]] connect a vertex and the midpoint of the opposite side
		- Medians do not necessarily bisect the opposite side
		- medians that meet the opposite side at a right angle are bisectors
	- The centroid of a triangle
		- The [[centroid]] of a triangle is where the three medians meet
		- The centroid is always inside the triangle
		- The centroid is two-thirds of the way from vertex to side
			- We can use this information to determine certain lengths
	- The altitudes of a triangle
		- [[Altitudes]] go from vertex to opposite side at a [[perpendicular angle]]
		- We may have to extend a side to from an altitude
	- The orthocenter of a triangle
		- The point where the altitudes meet is the [[orthocenter]]

	- Special lines pertaining to triangles (summary)
		- [[Perpendicular bisector|perpendicular bisectors]] meet at the [[circumcenter]]
			- The circumcenter is equidistant from the vertices
		- angle bisectors meet at the incenter
			- The incenter is equidistant from the sides
		- Medians meet at the centroid
		- Altitudes meet at the orthocenter
			- Altitudes make right angles with the opposite legs
	- Comprehension! (fill in the blank)
		- Perpendicular bisectors meet at the [[circumcenter]], which is the center of the circle that [[circumscribes]] the triangle 
		- Acute triangles have a circumcenter inside the triangle
		- Obtuse triangles have a circumcenter outside the triangle
		- Angle bisectors meet at the [[incenter]], which is the center of the circle that is [[inscribed]] in the triangle
		- Medians go from a [[vertex]] to the midpoint of the opposite side.
		- Medians meet at the [[centroid]]. Altitudes meet at the [[orthocenter]]
