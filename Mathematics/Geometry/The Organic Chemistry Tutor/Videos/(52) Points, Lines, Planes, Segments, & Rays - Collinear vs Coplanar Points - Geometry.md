## Intro
- Points
- Lines
- Planes
- Collinear Point
- Coplanar Points

## Definitions

### Zero-dimensional
- Point
	- A point in space (a dot)
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.19.54 AM.png|400]]

### One-dimensional
- Segment
	- Connects 2 dots in space. Has a beginning and an end
	- This can be segment $\overline {AB}$.

- Ray
	- Has a beginning but no end. It has 1 arrow
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.21.29 AM.png|400]]
- Line
	- No beginning or end
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.26.29 AM.png|400]]
		- A horizontal line can only travel in the x-direction

### Two-Dimensional
- Plane
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.29.19 AM.png|400]]
	- Can travel in the x-direction or the y-direction
		- Extends infinitely into the x and y directions
	- Flat as a pancake

## Collinear Points vs Non-collinear Points
- 3 points are collinear if they lie on the same line
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.30.31 AM.png|400]]
- 3 points are non-collinear if you can't draw them on the same line
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.30.41 AM.png|400]]
- 4 points that lie on the same plane are called coplanar points since they lie on the same plane
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.33.13 AM.png|400]]
		- This is plane "x"
- These 4 points are noncoplanar points because they do not lie on the same plane
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.33.25 AM.png|400]]
		- Points A, B, and C, lie on the plane but D is outside of the plane
		- If it's called plane "M", we'll say A, B, and C are located on plane M but D is not on plane M
			- Therefore all 4 points are noncoplanar points

### 4 Ways to determine existence of a plane
- 3 non-colinear points
	- There is always exactly 1 plane that can pass through 3 non-collinear points
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.38.20 AM.png|400]]
- 1 line and a point
	- Only 1 plane can pass through a line and a point
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.38.29 AM.png|400]]
- 2 parallel lines
	- Only 1 plane can pass through 2 parallel lines
		- These 2 lines are known as coplanar lines since they lie on the same plane
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.38.45 AM.png|400]]
- 2 lines that intersect
	- Only lie on 1 plane
		- They are coplanar lines since they share the same plane

### Non-coplanar Lines
- Line L perpendicular to line K
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.40.50 AM.png|400]]
	- Line L lies on plane M but line K does not


## Examples
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 12.42.44 AM.png|400]]
	- A, B, C, D, G are coplanar points
	- A, B, C, D, G, E, F are non-coplanar points
	-  $\overset \longleftrightarrow {AB} \text{ and } \overset \longleftrightarrow {DC}$ are coplanar lines
	-  $\overset \longleftrightarrow {AB} \text{ and } \overset \longleftrightarrow {DC}$ and $\overset \longleftrightarrow {EF}$ are non-coplanar lines
	- $\overline {AB}$ and $\overline {DC}$ are coplanar segments
	- $\overline {AB}$ and $\overline {DC}$  and $\overline {EF}$ are non-coplanar segments


## Verbal Questions
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-29 at 2.15.33 AM.png|400]]
	- Points E, D, and C determine plane X
	- Points F, D, and R determine plane Y
	- It takes at least 3 non-collinear points to determine a plane
