	- Given a circle with radius 5, find the circumference and area
	- [[Circumference]] of a circle formula
		- $2\pi r$
	- [[Area]] of a circle
		- $\pi r^2$
	- [[Radius]] is the center of the circle and it touches any point on the circle.
	- [[Diameter]] passes through the center of the circle, but it's the distance between one edge of the circle to the other
		- A [[chord]] is a line that touches 2 edges of the circle but doesn't pass through the center.
	- Formula for diameter
		- $d = 2R$ 
			- Twice the length of the radius

	- Square
		- Find area and perimeter when side length = 8
	- Area of square
		- $s^2$
			- side squared
	- Perimeter of square
		- $4s$
			-  Sum of 4 sides
