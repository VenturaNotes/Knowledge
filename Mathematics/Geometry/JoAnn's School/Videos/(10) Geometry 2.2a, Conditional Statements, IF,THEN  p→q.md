	- "If you don't bathe, then you'll stink."
		- This is a conditional statement. It's a statement that can be written in the form "If p, then q.""
		- The hypothesis is the part p of a conditional statement following the word if.
		- The conclusion is the part q of a conditional statement following the word then
	- In Chapter 1 we learned the symbol $\rightarrow$ is used as notation for is transformed to.
	- We also use $\rightarrow$ as notation for if $\rightarrow$ then.
		- p $\rightarrow$ q
		- p implies q

	- In a Venn diagram, ovals are used to represent each set. The ovals can overlap if the sets share common elements.
		- Real Numbers
			- Whole Numbers
			- Odd Numbers
		- Pets
			- Dogs
				- Poodle
	- "If it's a poodle, then it's a dog."
		- By phrasing a conjecture as an if-then statement, we can quickly identify its hypothesis and conclusion.

	- "If p, then q" can also be written as
		- "If p, q"
		- "q, if p"
		- "p implies q"
		- "p only if q"

	- We can write conditional statements from given information
	- The midpoint M of a segment bisects the segment.
	- Conditional: If M is the midpoint of a segment, then M bisects the segment.

	- The inner oval represents the hypothesis, and the outer oval represents the conclusion.
	- If an animal is a salmon, then it's a fish
		- Hypothesis: an animal is a salmon
		- Conclusion: the animal is a fish

	- If an angle is obtuse, it measures more than 90$\degree$
		- Hypothesis: an angle is obtuse
		- Conclusion: it measures more than 90$\degree$

	- A conditional statement has a truth value of either true (T) or false (F)
		- It's false only when the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false
	- If all pugs have short snouts, then all dogs with short snouts are pugs.
		- This conclusion is false. There's no truth value to this conditional

	- "If I win the lottery, I'll pay your school loans"
		- If I don't win the lottery, I haven't broken my promise.
	- So my statement is still true.

	- To show that a conditional statement is false, we need to find only one counterexample where the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is false

	- We can analyze the truth value of a conditional statement and determine if a conditional is true
	- If the conditional is false, we need to give a counterexample.
	- "If yesterday was Wednesday, then today is Thursday." Thursday follows Wednesday so it's True
	- "If a number is odd, then it's divisible by 5. False conclusion, counterexample 3 or 7"

	- The negation of a statement p is "not p" can be written as ~p. ~ is a tilde. In Math, the symbol ~, can mean "is similar to" or "approximately,", such as pi ~ 3.14. It can be doubled as $\approx$ or put above an equal sign as $\cong$ for congruence
	- In Logic, a type of math popular in computer science. ~ or $\lnot$ represents "not".
	- Types of Math for ~
		- Algebra: Approximately
		- Set Theory: Equivalence
		- Statistics: Media (or same distribution as)
		- Computer Science: not
		- Matrix Theory: Row equivalence
	- This can be very confusing!
	- My advice:
		- Use $\lnot$ for "not". It's the "logical negation" symbol

	- The negation  of the statement "M is the midpoint of $\overline {AB}$ " is "M is not the midpoint of $\overline {AB}$"

	- The negation of a true statement is false,
		- "My granddaughter has brown eyes" vs "My granddaughter doesn't have brown eyes"
		- Yes, she does! This negation of a true statement is false!
	- and the negation of a false statement is true.
		- "My granddaughter has hazel eyes" vs "My granddaughter doesn't have hazel eyes"
		- yes, true! This negation of a false statement is TRUE!

	- Related Conditionals:
		- A conditional is a statement that can be written in the form "If p, then q"
			- $p \rightarrow q$
		- The converse is the statement formed by exchanging the hypothesis and conclusion
			- $q \rightarrow p$
		- The inverse is the statement formed by   negating the hypothesis and conclusion
			- $\lnot p \rightarrow \lnot q$
		- The contrapositive is the statement formed by both exchanging and negating. the hypothesis and conclusion
			- $\lnot q \rightarrow \lnot p$

	- We can write the converse, inverse, and contrapositive of a conditional statement.
	- We need to find the truth value of each.
		- If a dog is a Pug, then it has a short snout.
	- Converse (swap both): If a dog has a short snout, then it's a pug
		- A bulldog has a short snout, so the converse is FALSE
	- Inverse (negate both): If a dog is not a Pug, then it doesn't have a short snout.
		- Again, a bulldog has a short snout. The inverse is FALSE
	- Contrapositive (swap and negate both): If a dog does not have a short snout, then it is not a Pug.
		- Pugs have short snouts. The contrapositive is TRUE

	- True for Pugs (same truth value)
		- Conditional statement
		- Contrapositive
	- False for pugs (same truth value)
	- Related conditional statements with the same truth value are called logically equivalent statements
	- A conditional and its contrapositive are logically equivalent, and so are the converse and inverse.
	- But, the converse of a true conditional isn't always FALSE
	- All four related conditionals can be TRUE, or all four can be false, depending on the statement.
	- Watch lesson 2.2b for more examples
