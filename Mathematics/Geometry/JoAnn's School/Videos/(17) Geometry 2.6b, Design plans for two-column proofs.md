	- Sometimes the hardest part of writing a proof is planning the logical steps that will take us from the given statement to the prove statement
	- It's just like doing a jigsaw puzzle, we can start with any piece.
	- We write down everything we know from the given statement
	- If we can't make a connection easily, we can start with the prove statement and work backwards
	- Then we connect the pieces into logical order
	- Our plan is a draft of the major Statements and Reasons. It may be shorter than the actual two-column proof.
	- 2.6.5 Common Angles Theorem
		- If two angles adjacent to a common angle are congruent, then the overlapping angles formed are congruent
		- Also called the common overlapping angle theorem and is similar to the common segment theorem
	- We can prove the Common Angles Theorem by developing a plan
		- Start by looking at the difference in the given and prove statements. How does $\angle AXB$ compare to $\angle AXC$? How does $\angle CXD$ compare to $\angle BXD$?
		- In both cases, the angle in the middle $\angle BXC$ is combined with the first angle to get the second angle.
	- The situation involves combining adjacent angle measures, so we list any definitions, properties, postulates, and theorems that might help us
		- Definition of Congruent angles
		- Angle addition postulate
		- Properties of equality
		- Reflexive, symmetric, or transitive property of congruence
	- Our plan
		- We start with what we're given and what we're trying to prove, and then we work towards the middle

	- Looking at step 1, $\angle BXC$ is the missing piece in the middle of our flow of logic. We need to write down what we know about $\angle BXC$
		- Reflexive property of equality
	- Now we need the angle addition postulate to finish the proof
		- 1.3.2: If S is in the interior of $\angle PQR$, then $m \angle PQS$ + $m\angle SQR$ = $m \angle PQR$
	- Addition Postulate
	- Deductive reasoning goes from generalities to specifics
	- (6) We use the pieces to write a complete two-column proof of the Common Angles Theorem
	- Reasons
		- Given, Definition of congruent angles, reflexive property of equality, addition property of equality, angle addition postulate, substitution property of equality, definition of congruent angles
	- Flow of logic
