	- When writing a geometric proof, we use deductive reasoning to make a chain of logical steps that move from the hypothesis to the conclusion of the conjecture we are proving
	- By proving that the conclusion is true, we have proven that the original conjecture is true.
	- Flowchart
		- Hypothesis
			- Info in the given
			- Definitions
			- Properties
			- Postulates
			- Theorems
				- Conclusion
	- When writing a proof, it's important to justify each logical step with a reason. We need to be precise and logical.
	- We can use symbols and abbreviations, but they must be clear enough so anyone who reads our proof will understand them.
	- We can write a justification for each step
		- Definition of complementary angles
		- Definition of congruent angles
		- Substitution Property of Equality
		- Definition of complementary angles
	- When a justification is based on more than the previous step, we can note this after the "reason"
		- The justification for step 5 was based on step 2 and step 4

	- A theorem is any statement that we can prove.
	- Once we have proven a theorem, we can use it as a reason in later proofs
	- 2.6.1: Linear Pair Theorem
		- Theorem: If two angles form a linear pair, then they are supplementary
		- Hypothesis: $\angle A$ and $\angle B$ form a linear pair
		- Conclusion: $\angle A$ and $\angle B$ are supplementary
	- 2.6.2: Congruent Supplements theorem
		- Theorem: If two angles are supplementary to the same angle (or to two congruent angles), then the two angles are congruent
		- Hypothesis: $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ are supplementary. $\angle 2$ and $\angle 3$ are supplementary
		- Conclusion: $\angle 1$ $\cong$ $\angle 3$
	- A geometric proof begins with given and prove statements, which restate the hypothesis and conclusion of the conjecture.
	- In a two-column proof, we list the steps of the proof in the left column.
	- We write the matching reason or justification for each step in the right column
		- Don't assume. Prove!
	- We can complete a two-column proof of the linear Pair theorem
		- Definition of linear pair
		- Definition of straight angles
		- Angle addition postulate
		- Substitution
		- Definition of supplementary angles
	- The reason must match the statement it's aligned with

	- Before we start writing a proof, we should plan out our logic.
	- Sometimes we'll be given a plan for a more challenging proof. This plan will detail the major steps of the proof for us
	- 2.6.3 Right Angle Congruence Theorem
		- Theorem: All right angles are congruent
		- Hypothesis: $\angle A$ and $\angle B$ are right angles
		- Conclusion: $\angle A$ $\cong$ $\angle B$
	- 2.6.4 Congruent Complements Theorem
		- Theorem: If two angles are complementary to the same angle (or to two congruent angles), then the two angles are congruent
		- Hypothesis: $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ are complementary. $\angle 2$ and $\angle 3$ are complementary
		- Conclusion: $\angle 1$ $\cong$ $\angle 3$
	- There are 4 parts of a Two-column proof! (kinda 5 w/ diagram)
		- (1) Given
		- (2) Prove
		- (3) Statements
		- (4) Reasons
	- We can write a two-column proof of the right angle congruence theorem from a given plan
		- Given: $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ are right angles
		- Prove: $\angle 1$ $\cong$ $\angle 2$
		- Plan: Use the definition of a right angle to write the measure of each angle. Then use the transitive property and the definition of congruent angles. 
	- Proof
		- Given
		- Definition of right angles
		- Transitive property of equality
		- Definition of congruent angles
	- If a diagram for a proof is not given, we can draw our own and mark the given information on it.
		- Only use the information from the given:, not the prove

	- The proof process
		- (1) Write the conjecture to be proven
		- (2) Draw a diagram to represent the hypothesis of the conjecture
		- (3) State the given information and mark it on the diagram
		- (4) State the conclusion of the conjecture in terms of the diagram
		- (5) Plan the argument and prove the conjecture with information in the given, definitions, properties, postulates, and theorems
	- Remember, we can rewrite a definition as a conditional statement (with. hypothesis and conclusion) to use it as a justification in the order we need to apply it.
	- Sometimes we can design our plan backwards starting from the prove: if we can't connect it forwards
