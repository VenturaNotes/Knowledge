	- We now know
		- Conditional statements are "if, then" statements.
		- The hypothesis follows "if".
		- The conclusion follows "then".
		- To prove a conditional statement is FALSE, we need only one counterexample.
		- Conditional statements have truth value.
		- The negation of a statement "p" is "not p"
		- It's less confusing to use the "Logical Negation" symbol $\lnot$ for "not" than to use a tilde ~ because the tilde has so many different meanings.

	- Negation
		- "I have a dog named Lola."
		- "I don't have a dog named Lola"
	- The negation of a TRUE statement is FALSE

	- Negation
		- "I have a pet ostrich"
		- "I don't have a pet ostrich"

	- Converse
		- The statement formed by swapping the hypothesis and conclusion
	- Conditional Statement: "If the bird can fly, then the bird has wings"
	- Converse: "If the bird has wings, then the bird can fly"
	- This converse is FALSE.
	- Counterexample: penguins have wings but can't fly
	- The converse has no truth value
	- A conditional statement is FALSE when the hypothesis is True, but the conclusion is False

	- Inverse:
		- The statement formed by negating the hypothesis and conclusion
	- Conditional Statement: "If the bird can fly, then the bird has wings."
	- Inverse: "If the bird cannot fly, then the bird doesn't have wings."
	- This inverse is False
		- Counterexample: an ostrich has wings but can't fly
	- The inverse has no truth value

	- Contrapositive
		- The statement formed by both swapping and negating the hypothesis and conclusion.
	- Conditional Statement: "If the bird can fly, then the bird has wings."
	- Contrapositive: If the bird has no wings, then the bird can't fly."
	- This contrapositive is true.

	- When all related statements are true
		- Conditional Statement (true): "If it's worth 100 pennies, then it's worth a dollar"
		- Converse (true): "If it's worth a dollar, then it's worth 100 pennies"
		- Inverse (true): "If it's not worth 100 pennies, then it's not worth a dollar"
		- Contrapositive (true): "If it's not worth a dollar, then it's not worth 100 pennies."
		- All four of these related statements are TRUE. They are all logically equivalent
		- Sometimes this happens with related statements
	- When all related statements are FALSE
		- Conditional Statement (false): "If a number is a multiple of 2, then it's a multiple of 3"
			- Counterexample is 2
		- Converse (false): "If a number is a multiple of 3, then it's a multiple of 2"
			- Counterexample is 9
		- Inverse (false): "If a number is not a multiple of 2, then it's not a multiple of 3."
			- Counterexample is 9
		- Contrapositive (false): "If a number is not a multiple of 3, then it's not a multiple of 2"
			- Counterexample is 4
		- All four of these related statements are FALSE. They are all logically equivalent. They have no truth value.
		- Sometimes this happens with related statements.
