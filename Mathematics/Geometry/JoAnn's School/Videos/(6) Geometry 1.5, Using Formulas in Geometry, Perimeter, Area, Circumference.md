	- In this lesson, we're going to apply formulas for perimeter, area, and circumference
	- The perimeter P of a plane figure is the sum of the side lengths of the figure
		- 10 units
	- The area A of a plane figure is the number of non-overlapping square units of a given size that exactly coven the figure
		- 10 square units

	- Perimeter is the length around the sides of the figure
	- Area is the two-dimensional measurement of the amount of squares that can fit inside the figure.

	- Perimeter and Area Formulas
		- Rectangle
			- $A = lw$
		- Square
			- $A = s^2$ (s = side length)
		- Triangle
			- $A = \frac 12 bh$ or $\frac {bh}{2}$

	- The base b can be any side of a triangle
	- The height h is the segment from a vertex that forms a right angle with a line containing the base
		- The height may be the side of a triangle
		- It may be in the interior
		- It may be at the exterior

	- We can find the perimeter and area of a rectangle with a length of 16cm and a width of 4cm by using the formulas P = 2l + 2w and A = lw.
	- Perimeter is expressed in linear units, such as inches or centimeters
	- Area is expressed in square units, such as square centimeters ($cm^2$)

	- We can find the perimeter and area of a triangle in which a = 8, b = (x+1), c = 4x, and h = 6 using the formulas P = a + b + c and A = $\frac 12bh$

	- In a circle, a diameter is a segment that passes through the center of the circle and whose endpoints are on the circle
	- A radius r of a circle is a segment whose endpoints are the center of the circle and a point on the circle.
	- The circumference C of a circle is the distance around the circle

	- Circumference and Area of a Circle Formulas
	- Circumference
		- C = $\pi d$ or $c = 2\pi r$
	- Area
		- $A = $\pi r^2$
	- Notice that the diameter = 2r and the radius is $\frac 12 d$

	- The ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter is the same for all circles.
	- This ratio is represented by the Greek letter $\pi$ (pi).
	- The value of pi is irrational, which means it cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers.
	- There are too many digits of pi to do this.
	- Pi is often approximated as 3.14 or $\frac {22}{7}$
	- Occasionally in Math, we will use the letter $\pi$ in our answer. This is referred to as solving in terms of $\pi$

	- We can find the circumference and area of a circle using the formulas
	- We're not multiplying by all the digits of pi, so it's an approximation. If our answer contains the symbol $\pi$, we can use an equal sign because $\pi$ represents all the digits.
