	- We've learned that one counterexample is enough to disprove a conjecture
	- But, to prove that a conjecture is TRUE, we must use deductive reasoning
	- Deductive reasoning uses logic to draw conclusions from given facts, definitions, and properties

	- Inductive Reasoning
		- Based on patters
		- Limited Observation
		- High probability of being true
		- Some risk of error
	- Deductive Reasoning
		- Based on logic
		- Step-by-step process
		- Scientific Method
		- Properties, theorems, axioms, and definitions
		- Facts

	- Inductive or deductive?
		- There's a myth that you can balance an egg on its end only on the Spring Equinox. (see link for wikipedia info)
		- A person was able to balance an egg on its end on July 8, September 21, and again on December 19
		- Conclusion: This myth is FALSE
			- Inductive
				- This is inductive. It's based on a pattern of observation

	- The Triangle Sum Theorem states that the sum of the angle measures of a triangle is 180$\degree$
	- Two angles of a triangle measure 40$\degree$ and 80$\degree$
	- Conclusion: The third angle is 60$\degree$
		- This is deductive because we're using the Triangle Sum Theorem

	- invalid: adjective meaning without value, worthless
	- valid: adjective meaning supported by facts or authority
	- Premise: noun meaning a statement assumed to be true and used to draw a conclusion

	- In deductive reasoning, if the given facts are true and we apply the correct logic, then the conclusion must be true
	- The Law of Detachment is one valid form of deductive reasoning
	- The Law of Detachment
		- If $p \rightarrow q$ is a true statement and p is TRUE, then q is TRUE
	- We can verify conjectures by using the Law of Detachment
	- Given: If two segments are congruent, then they have the same length
		- Conjecture: AB = CD
		- Hypothesis: If two segments are congruent
		- Conclusion: then they have the same length
		- $\overline {AB} \cong \overline {CD}$ matches the hypothesis of a TRUE conditional
		- By the Law of Detachment, AB = CD.
			- The conjecture is valid.

	- Given: If you're tardy 3 times, you must go to detention. Bob is in detention
	- Conjecture: Bob was tardy at least 3 times
	- We determine which is the hypothesis and which is the conclusion
	- Hypothesis: If you are tardy 3 times
	- Conclusion: You must go to detention
	- The given statement, "Bob is in detention," matches the conclusion of a TRUE conditional.
	- But this doesn't mean the hypothesis is TRUE. Bob could be in detention for another reason!
	- The conjecture is not valid.

	- Law of Syllogism
		- If p $\rightarrow$ q and q $\rightarrow$ r are TRUE statements, then p $\rightarrow$ r is a TRUE statement
	- This is another valid form of deductive reasoning. It lets us draw conclusions from two conditional statements when the conclusion of one statement is the hypothesis of the other statement.

	- Major premise: A general statement about a whole group.
	- Minor Premise: A specific statement about something that indicates membership in the group
	- If we accept both the major and minor premise as TRUE, then we must accept the conclusion as TRUE.
	- Conditional Statement:
		- Major Premise: All birds have feathers.
	- Conditional Statement:
		- Minor Premise: Sparrows are birds
	- We've shown that sparrows are members of the group "birds."
	- Now we arrive at a conclusion based on the major and minor premise.
	- Conclusion: Sparrows have feathers
	- This series of statements is called a syllogism
	- We get to our conclusion based on statements that are accepted as TRUE

	- But this isn't always the case. We can still draw invalid conclusions even if our premise is TRUE.
	- Major premise: you must be 16 to get a driver's license in Illinois.
	- Minor Premise: Dave is over 16 years old.
	- Conclusion: Dave has a driver's lincense.
	- What if we swapped the minor premise and the conclusion?
	- Would it be valid?
	- After swapping, it became valid

	- We can verify conjectures by using the Law of Syllogism and determine if they're valid
	- Given: If $m\angle A < 90\degree$, then $\angle A$ is acute. If $\angle A$ is acute, then it is not a right angle.
	- Conjecture: If m$\angle A < 90\degree$, then it is not a right angle
	- We're given that $p \rightarrow q$ and q $\rightarrow$ r because q is the conclusion of the first conditional statement and the hypothesis of the second conditional statement, we can conclude that p $\rightarrow$ r.
	- The conjecture is valid by the Law of Syllogism
	- Parts
		- p: The measure of an angle is less than 90$\degree$
		- q: the angle is acute
		- r: the angle is not a right angle
	- The Law of sSyllogism is similar to the Transitive Property of Equality used in Algebra. They both involve the same term in the middle. If a = b and b = c, then a = c.

- Given: If a number is divisible by 4, then it is divisible by 2. If a number is even, then it is divisible by 2
- Conjecture: If a number is divisible by 4, then it's even.
- Parts
	- p: a number is divisible by 4.
	- q: a number is divisible by 2
	- r: a number is even
	- q: a number is divisible by 2
- We're given that p $\rightarrow$ q and r $\rightarrow$ q. The Law of Syllogism can't be used to draw a conclusion because q is the conclusion of both conditionals.
- Even though the conjecture p $\rightarrow$ q is TRUE, the logic that was used to make the conclusion isn't valid.

	- We can draw a conclusion by using the Law of deductive reasoning.
	- Given: If two angles make a linear pair, then they are adjacent. If two angles are adjacent, then they share a side. $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ make a linear pair.
	- Conclusion: $\angle 1$ and $\angle 2$ share a side
	- This is valid.
