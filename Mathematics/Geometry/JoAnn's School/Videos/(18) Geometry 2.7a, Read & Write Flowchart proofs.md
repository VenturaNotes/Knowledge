	- We now know there are two-column proofs
	- A second type of proof is called a flowchart proof, which uses boxes and arrows to show the structure of the proof
	- Flowchart example
		- A flowchart is a concept map
	- Given: if hypotheses
	- Prove: then conclusion
	- In a flowchart proof, the steps move from left to right or from the top to the bottom. Arrows connected to each box show the direction of logic.
	- The justification for each step is written below the box.
	- 2.7.1: Common Segments Theorem
		- Theorem: Given collinear points, A, B, C and D arranged as shown, if $\overline {AB} \cong \overline {CD}$, then  $\overline {AC} \cong \overline{BD}$
		- Hypothesis: If $\overline {AB} \cong \overline {CD}$
		- Conclusion: $\overline {AC} \cong \overline{BD}$
