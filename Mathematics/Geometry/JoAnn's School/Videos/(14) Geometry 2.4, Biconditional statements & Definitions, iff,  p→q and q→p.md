	- If this month is July, then next month is August. $p \implies q$
	- Converse
		- If next month is August, then this month is July. $q \implies p$
	- When we combine a conditional statement with its converse, we create a biconditional statement.
	- A biconditional statement can be written in the form "p if and only if q".
		- p $\iff$ q means p $\implies$ q and q $\implies$ p
	- This means "if p, then q" and "if q, then p"
		- "if and only if" can be abbreviated to "iff"
			- $\iff$ read as "if and only if"

	- We can identify the conditionals within a biconditional statement by finding the conditional statement and converse.
	- Example
		- Two angles are congruent if and only if their measures are equal. We assign p and q
			- p: Two angles are congruent
			- q: Two angle measures are equal
		- p $\iff$ q are p$\implies q$ and q $\implies$ p
		- Conditional: If two angles are congruent, then their measures are equal
		- Converse: If two angle measures are equal, then the angles are congruent.

	- Example
		- A solution is a base $\iff$ its pH is more than 7.
		- Let X represent the hypothesis and y represent the conclusion.
			- x: a solution is a base
			- y: a solution has a pH more than 7
			- x $\iff$ y are x $\implies$ y and y $\implies$ x
		- Conditional: If a solution is a base, then it has a pH more than 7
		- Converse: If a solution has a pH more than 7, then it is a base

	- for each conditional, we can write the converse and a biconditional.
		- If 2x + 5 = 11, then x = 3
		- Converse: If x = 3, then 2x + 5 = 11
		- Biconditional: 2x + 5 = 11 if and only if x = 3

	- If a point is a midpoint, then it divides the segment into two congruent segments.
		- Converse: If a point divides a segment into two congruent segments, then the point is a midpoint.
		- Biconditional: A point is a midpoint if and only if it divides the segment into two congruent segments

	- For a biconditional statement to be true, both the conditional statement and its converse must be true
	- If either the conditional or its converse are FALSE, then the biconditional statement is FALSE
		- We can analyze the truth value of a biconditional statement.

	- We can determine if each biconditional is TRUE. If it's FALSE, we can give a counterexample
		- A square has a side length of 5 if and only if it has an area of 2.5
			- Conditional: If a square has a side length of 5, then it has an area of 25. (True)
			- Converse: If a square has an area of 25, then it has a side length of 5. (True)
		- Because the conditional and its converse are TRUE, the biconditional is TRUE
	- The number n is a positive integer $\iff$ 2n is a natural number
		- Conditional: If n is a positive integer, then 2n is a natural number (TRUE)
		- Converse: If 2n is a natural number, then n is a positive integer. (FALSE)
		- If 2n = 1, then n has to equal $\frac 12$ and fractions are not integers.
		- Because the converse is FALSE, the biconditional is FALSE.

	- In Geometry, biconditional statements are used to write definitions
	- A definition is a statement that describes a mathematical object and can be written as a TRUE biconditional
	- Most definitions in a Geometry book glossary are not written as biconditional statements, but they can be. The "if and only if" is implied
	- If we look up Polygon in the glossary, it's defined as a closed plane figure formed by three or more line segments such that each segment intersects exactly two other segments only at their endpoints and no two segments with a common endpoint are collinear
		- Polygons, Not Polygons

	- A triangle is defined as a three-sided polygon
	- A quadrilateral is defined as a four-sided polygon
	- If a definition is good and precise, it can be used forward and backward
		- If a figure is a four-sided polygon, then it is a quadrilateral
	- To make sure a definition is precise, we can try writing it as a biconditional statement
		- A triangle is a three-sided polygon. A figure is a triangle if and only if it is a three-sided polygon
		- Another example
			- A segment bisector is a ray, segment or line that divides a segment into two congruent segments
			- A ray, segment, or line is a segment bisector if and only if it divides a segment into two congruent segments
	- It's necessary to be able to write a definition as a biconditional statement so the definition is precise and reversible
	- We know a biconditional statement is TRUE when the conditional statement and its converse it contains are both TRUE
		- A biconditional contains the conditional and its converse
		- Biconditional statements are like reversible jackets that can be worn right side out or inside out.
		- A conditional isn't reversible but a biconditional is.
