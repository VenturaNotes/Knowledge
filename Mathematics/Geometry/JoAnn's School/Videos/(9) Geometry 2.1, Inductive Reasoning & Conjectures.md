	- Inductive reasoning is using a pattern to make a conclusion
	- We conclude that a general rule or principle is true because specific cases of the rule are true
	- We need to be careful because some patterns have more than one correct rule
	- If we use a pattern that came from several examples, we can assume the pattern will continue, and we'll be applying inductive reasoning
	- A statement that we believe to be true based on inductive reasoning is called a conjecture
	- Dictionary Definition: Conjecture (noun) a conclusion reached by guessing

	- We can identify a pattern and find the next item
		- January, March, May, July, ...
			- These are alternating months of the year. The next month in this pattern is September
		- 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, ...
			- These are multiples of 5. The next number in this pattern is 30.
		- $\leftarrow, \uparrow, \rightarrow,$ ...
			- The arrow is rotating 90$\degree$ clockwise each time. The next figure is $\downarrow$. 
		- .1, .01, .001, .0001, ...
			- This decimal number is decreasing by one-tenth each time. Each item is multiplied by .1 to get the next. The next number in this pattern is .00001.

	- We can complete each conjecture
		- The product of an even number and an odd number is (even or odd)
		- We list some examples and look for a pattern
		- They're all even!

	- The number of segments formed by n collinear points is the sum of the numbers less than n.
	- Collinear means on the same line. Video 1.1

	- Map of modern day California
	- To study the migration behavior of California Grey Whales, biologists observed whales along two routes.
	- They counted the number of whales along each route for seven days
	- Make a conjecture from the data given in the table.
		- Number of whales per day
			- Direct route
			- Shore route
	- More were seen along the shore route each day. The data supports the conjecture that most California Grey whales migrate along the shoreline

	- To show the conjecture is ALWAYS TRUE, we must prove it. (We'll do this in lesson 2.3)
	- To show that a conjecture is FALSE, we need only one example in which its NOT TRUE.
		- This is called a counterexample.
	- A counterexample can be a drawing, statement, or a number.
	- Inductive reasoning
		- Look for a pattern
		- Make a conjecture
		- Prove the conjecture or find a counterexample to show it's false.
	- When testing number conjectures, use various types like whole numbers and fraction, positive  numbers, negative numbers, and zero.

	- We can show a conjecture is FALSE by finding a counterexample.
		- For all positive numbers n, $\frac 1n \le n$.
		- We pick positive values for n and substitute them into the equation to see if the conjecture holds true.
			- $\frac {1}{n} \le n$
		- n = $\frac 12$ is a counterexample

	- For any three points in a plane, there are three different lines that contain two of the points. We draw three collinear points
	- If the three points are collinear, the conjecture is FALSE
	- The three points being collinear is a counterexample.
	- Collinear means they're on the same line

	- For every integer n, $n^3$ is positive.
	- n = -2 is a counterexample

	- Two complementary angles are not congruent
	- The conjecture holds
	- 45$\degree$ and 45$\degree$ proves this FALSE. This is a counterexample

	- Which conjecture is false?
		- (1) If x is odd, then x + 1 is even
		- (2) The sum of two odd numbers is even
		- (3) The difference of two even numbers is positive
		- (4) If x is positive, -x is negative

	- Lisa ate 3 cookies each day on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. Inductive reasoning leads us to the conjecture that she'll eat 3 cookies on Friday. Is this an absolute fact? The probability is strong
		- This is not an absolute fact

	- Inductive reasoning is a method of reasoning in which the premises are viewed as supplying some evidence for the truth of the conjecture.
		- The truth may be probable, based on the given evidence
		- There's a possibility that the conclusion is false
	- True: My granddaughter has brown eyes
	- True: My neighbor's granddaughter has brown eyes
	- False: All granddaughters have brown eyes
	- We'll discuss deductive reasoning in 2.3
