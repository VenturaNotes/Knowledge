	- A transformation is a change in the position, size, or shape of a figure
	- The original figure is called the pre-image
	- The transformed figure is called the image
	- A transformation maps the pre-image to the image
	- Arrow notation ($\rightarrow$)  means "is transformed to" and primes (') are used to label the image
		- Primes are not exponents. They're tick marks (like little apostrophes)
	- $\triangle ABC$ "slid" to position $A'B'C'$

	- We'll talk about dilations in chapter 4 (Optimus prime)
	- Transformations
		- A reflection, or flip, is a transformation across a line, called the line of reflection.
		- Each point and its image are the same distance from the line of reflection.
	- Reference
		- Grade 8 chapter 9
	- Learning is by layering (learn it one year and then learn a little more about it next year)

	- A rotation, or turn, is a transformation about a point, called the center of rotation.
	- Each point and its image are the same distance from the center of rotation.

	- A translation, or slide, is a transformation in which all the points of a figure move the same distance in the same direction

	- We can identify transformations by looking at the figures
	- This figure flipped across a line of reflection. It's a reflection
	- Then we can use arrow notation to describe the transformation
		- $\triangle ABC$ $\rightarrow$ $\triangle A'B'C'$
			- "Triangle ABC is transformed to triangle $A'B'C'$

	- This figure turned clockwise 270$\degree$. It's a rotation. Or we can say it turned counter-clockwise 90$\degree$

	- This figure didn't flip or turn. It slid. It's a translation

	- We can draw and identify transformations
	- A figure has vertices at (points listed)
	- After a transformation, the image of the figure has vertices at (points listed)
	- Draw the pre image and the image and identify the transformation
	- Plot the points and use a straight edge to connect the vertices.
	- It's a reflection across the x-axis as the line of reflection
	- Each point and its image are the same distance from the x-axis. They have the same x-coordinates

	- There are primes for the first image, double primes for the second image, triple primes for the third image

	- To find coordinates for the image of a figure in a translation, we add "a" to the x-coordinates of the pre image and add "b" to the y-coordinates of the pre image.
	- Translations can also be described by a rule (x, y) $\rightarrow$ (x + a, y + b)
	- We can find the coordinates for the image of $\triangle ABC$ after the translation (x, y) $\rightarrow$ (x + 3, y - 4) and draw the image 
	- First we find the coordinates of $\triangle ABC$.
	- Next we apply the rule to find the vertices of the image
	- We can plot these points and finish the drawing of the image by using a straightedge to connect the vertices

	- We can write a rule that maps the car from position 1 to position 2.
	- We choose a point A on the pre image and a corresponding point $A'$ on the image.
	- A has coordinates (1, 2) and
	- $A'$ has coordinates (-9, 4)
	- The image didn't rotate or reflect so it must have slid as a translation.
	- To translate A to A' 10 units are subtracted from the x-coordinate and 2 units are added to the y-coordinate
	- Our translation rule is (x, y) = (x-10, y + 2)
	- The rule will be the same no matter which point we began with. If B(10, 2) then B'(0, 4)

	- Line of reflection
		- You are the preimage. Your reflection is the image 
	- The mirror itself is the line of reflection

	- Center of rotation is the center of her head
	- Right one is tighter so she spins faster
---
- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-25 at 1.15.36 AM.png]]
	- Center of rotation can be the center or one of the vertices
		- Could be away from the figure as well

	- Dilation = resize either larger or smaller
