- A ruler can be used to measure the distance between two points
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.25.27 PM.png]]
- A point corresponds to only one number on the ruler, and that number is called a coordinate
- Ruler Postulate
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.26.28 PM.png]]
		- 1.2.1: The points on a line can be put into a 1 to 1 correspondence with the real numbers
- A postulate is a statement that is accepted as true without proof, also called axioms.
- The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">distance</mark> between any two points is the absolute value of the difference of the coordinates.
	- If the coordinates of points A and B are a and b, then the distance between A and B is $|a-b|$ or $|b-a|$
- The distance between A and B is also called the length of $\overline {AB}$ or AB
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.30.38 PM.png]]
	- Example
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.31.10 PM.png]]
		- Absolute value is its distance from zero
- We can find the length of a segment
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.31.43 PM.png]]
- [[Congruent segments]] are segments that have the same length
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.32.28 PM.png]]
		- Tick marks show congruence.
		- Congruent means same size and shape ($\cong$)
- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.33.03 PM.png]]
	- We read this as "segment JK is congruent to segment LM."
	- Tick marks are used to show congruent segments.
	- Be careful!!
		- JK represents a number, while $\overline {JK}$ represents a geometric figure. We use an equal sign for numbers (JK = LM) and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">congruence</mark> for figures ($\overline{JK}$ $\cong$ $\overline{LM}$)
- We can use a compass and a straight edge to make a precise segment
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.38.28 PM.png]]
	- To construct a segment congruent to $\overline {JK}$
		- (1) Draw a line
		- (2) Choose a point on the line and label it J
		- (3) Open the compass to distance JK
		- (4) Put the point of the compass on J and draw an arc through the line. Label the point of intersection K
	- Make sure the compass stays the same size!

- For us to say that a point B is between two points A and C, all 3 points must lie on the same line, and AB + BC = AC
- Segment Addition Postulate:
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.39.47 PM.png]]
		- 1.2.2: If B is between A and C, then AB + BC = AC
- Using the segment addition postulate (solve using additive inverse)
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.40.59 PM.png]]
- S is between R and T, Find RT (solve using additive inverse)
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.43.10 PM.png]]
- A midpoint is the point that bisects, or divides, the segment into two congruent segments
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 9.56.10 PM.png]]
		- If M is the midpoint of $\overline {AB}$, then AM = MB. So if AB = 6, then AM = 3 and MB = 3.
	- Example
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 9.59.29 PM.png|500]]
			- Tree A is 365m from tree B and 2km from tree D. Tree C is located at the midpoint of tree B and D. How far is tree A from tree C?
- A [[segment bisector]] is any ray, segment, or line that intersects a segment at its midpoint. It divides the segment into two equal parts at its midpoint.
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 10.01.07 PM.png]]
		- The fold is the segment bisector
- We can use midpoints to find length
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 10.03.37 PM.png]]
		- Betweenness involves collinearity
		- A segment has exactly one midpoint
