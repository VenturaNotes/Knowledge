- Understanding points, lines, and planes
- A [[point]] names a location, has no size and is labeled with a capital letter.
	- $\bullet$ A
	- ![[Pasted image 20230424175945.png]]
- A [[line]] is a straight path that has no thickness and extends forever. It's labeled with a lower case letter or by two points on the line.

- A [[plane]] is a flat surface that has no thickness and extends forever. It's labeled by a script capital letter or 3 points not on a line.

	- $\mathscr R$
- Points, lines, and planes are undefined terms. They are basic figures in Geometry that aren't defined in terms of other figures
- Points that lie on the same line are collinear
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.03.54 PM.png]]
		- Points A, B, and C are collinear.
		- Points A, B, and D are noncollinear
- Points that lie in the same plane are coplanar
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.04.26 PM.png]]
		- Points A, B, and C are coplanar
		- Points A and D are noncoplanar
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.05.09 PM.png|300]]
		- P, Q, R, and S are coplanar points. They lie in the same plane
- A segment, or line segment, is the part of a line consisting of two points and all points between them

- An endpoint is a point at one end of a segment, or the starting point of a ray. They're labeled with a capital letter
- A ray is part of a line that starts at an endpoint and extends forever in one direction. It's labeled by its endpoints and any other point on the ray

- Opposite rays are two rays that have a common endpoint and form a line. They're labeled by the common endpoint and any other point on each ray.

- A postulate is a statement that is accepted as true without proof. They're also called axioms
- Postulates for points, lines, and planes:
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.09.43 PM.png]]
		- 1.1.1: Through any two points, there is exactly one line.
		- 1.1.2: Through any 3 noncollinear points, there is exactly one plane containing them.
		- 1.1.3: If two points lie in a plane, then the line containing those points lies in the plane
- A system of equations is a set of two or more equations containing two or more of the same variables
- The coordinates of the solution of the system satisfy <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">all</mark> equations in the system.
- These coordinates also locate the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">point</mark> where all the graphs of the equations in the system <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">intersect</mark>.
- An [[Intersection]] is the set of all points that two or more figures have in common
- Postulates for intersection of lines and planes
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.13.35 PM.png]]
		- 1.1.4: If two lines intersect, then they intersect in exactly one point.
		- 1.1.5: If two planes intersect, then they intersect in exactly one line.

- We use a dashed line to show the hidden parts of a figure that we draw. The dashed line will indicate the part of the figure that isn't seen.

		- This line intersects plane $\mathscr R$, but doesn't lie in the plane.
		- These two planes intersect in one line.
- Line AB intersects two nonintersecting planes
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.15.46 PM.png]]
- Three coplanar lines intersect in three different points
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.16.15 PM.png]]
- Plane $\mathscr M$ contains two lines that intersect at S
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.18.43 PM.png]]
- $\overset \longleftrightarrow {AB}$ intersects plane $\mathscr P$ at S.

- A ray with endpoint A that passes through B
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-24 at 6.20.02 PM.png]]
- Key
	- $\overset \longleftrightarrow {AB}$ = line AB
	- $\overset \longrightarrow {AB}$ = ray AB
	- $\overline {AB}$ = line segment AB
- Get a notebook to write all the postulates (axioms), theorems, and definitions. You'll be glad you did when we start doing proofs!
- Writing them will help you learn them, too!
- We need to completely learn the meanings of these words and understand the postulates
