- Use the pythagorean theorem to find "c"
	- Formula
		- $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$ 
	- It is a theorem we use with right triangles to find the lengths of each of the sides of the triangle.
		- It can only be used with a right triangle (which has an angle of $90\degree)$
	- Given the lengths of 2 sides of the triangle, we can find the 3rd side of the 
	- The result will always be positive
