	- Area forumla:
		- $A = \frac 12 (b_1 + b_2)h$ 
- A trapezoid is a 4 sided figure (quadrilateral)
	- 2 sides of the trapezoid are always parallel
		- These are the bases
		- The height is the distance between the bases
			- The straight line will always have two 90$\degree$ angles
	- The other 2 sides are not parallel (they're usually slanted)
