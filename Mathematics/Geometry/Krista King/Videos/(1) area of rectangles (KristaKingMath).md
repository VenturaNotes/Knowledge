- Find the area of each rectangle
	- A rectangle is a specific type of quadrilateral (a 4-sided figure) where each of the 4 interior angles are 90$\degree$ 
- Area of rectangle formula
	- $A = bh$ 
		- $\text{area }= \text{ base } \times \text { height }$ 
		- Horizontal dimension is the base
		- Vertical dimension is the height.
		- "Square units" is the default unit of measurement

## Problems

- First Column
	- Area ADLI
		- Take the base (15) and multiply the height (11) to get 165.
	- Area CDLK
		- Since 2 base measurements are 15 and 13, you can find the missing base for that rectangle to be 2. Then multiply by 11 to get 22
	- Area BCHG
		- The base is 8 because 10-2 is 8. The height is 4 as it's given. So solution is 32
- Second Column
	- To find the area of given coordinates, just plot them and use $A=bh$ 
- Third column
	- Area is $27ft^2$. base is 3 more than twice the height
	- Need to [[(Video) Factoring Trinomials with Leading Coefficient not 1 (fast way)|factor the trinomial]] to find the height=3
