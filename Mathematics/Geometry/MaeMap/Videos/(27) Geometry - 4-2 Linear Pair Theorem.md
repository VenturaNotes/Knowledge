	- Angle Addition Postulate
		- P.11) If x is in the interior of $\angle ABC$, then the measure of $\angle ABC$ is equal to the sum of the measures of $\angle ABX and \angle XBC$ 
	- Linear Pair Theorem
		- T.5) If two angles form a linear pair, then they are supplementary angles
	- Informal proof of linear pair theorem is shown
	- Definition of linear pair
		- Noncommon sides form opposite rays
			- So $\angle ABC \text { and } \angle CBD$ form opposite rays $\overset \longrightarrow {BA}$ and $\overset \longrightarrow {BD}$
