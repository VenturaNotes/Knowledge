	- Three Point Postulate
		- P.4) Through any three noncollinear points, there exists exactly one plane
	- Plane-Point Postulate
		- P.5) A plane contains at least three noncollinear points.
	- Plane-Line Postulate
		- P.6) If two points lie in a plane, then the line containing them lies in that plane.
	- Plane Intersection Postulate
		- P.7) If two planes intersect, then their intersection is a line
