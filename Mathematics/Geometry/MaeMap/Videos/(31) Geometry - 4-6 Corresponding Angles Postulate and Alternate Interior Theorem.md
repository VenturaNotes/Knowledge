	- [[Corresponding Angles Postulate]]
		- P.12) If two parallel lines are intersected by transversal, then the corresponding angles are congruent
			- $\angle A \cong \angle E$
			- $\angle B \cong \angle F$
			- $\angle C \cong \angle G$
			- $\angle D \cong \angle H$
	- [[Alternate Interior Angle Theorem]]
		- T.7) If two parallel lines are intersected by a transversal, then each pair of alternate interior angles is congruent
		- Two-column proof
			- Given
			- Corresponding angles postulate
			- Vertical Angle Theorem
			- Transitive Property
