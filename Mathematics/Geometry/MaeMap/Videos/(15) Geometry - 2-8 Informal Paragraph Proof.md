	- Segment Addition Postulate
		- P.8)
			- If B is between A and C, then AB + BC = AC.
			- If AB + BC = AC, then B is between AC.
	- Theorem - A conjecture or statement that is proven or shown to be true
	- Proof - a logical argument that uses definitions, postulates, and previously proved theorems
	- Paragraph/Informal Proof - Explains why a conjecture is true for a situation in the form of a written paragraph
		- 1) Understand the theorem or conjecture to be proven
		- 2) List given information
		- 3) Illustrate given information if possible
		- 4) State what needs to be proven
		- 5) Develop the steps
	- Problem
		- A line is formed such that B is between A and C, and AB = 5 and BC = 7. Prove that $AC = 12$
			- Given: B is between A and C
				- AB = 5
				- BC = 7
			- Illustrate/sketch information
			- Prove: AC = 12
			- Since B is between A and C, from P.8, then AB + BC = AC. We know AB = 5 and BC = 7, so 5 + 7 = AC. Therefore, AC=12
