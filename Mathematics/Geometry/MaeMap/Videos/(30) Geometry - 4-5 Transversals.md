	- [[Transversals]]: A line that intersects at least 2 lines in a plane at separate points
		- In the example above, q is the traversal
	- [[Interior angles]]: Within the 2 lines that the transversal crosses
		- [[Consecutive Interior Angles]]:  Interior angles that lie on the same side of the transversal and are interior
		- [[Alternate Interior Angles]]: Interior angles on alternate sides of the transversal and on alternate lines
	- [[Exterior angles]]: In the space outside the 2 lines
		- [[Alternate Exterior Angles]]: Exterior angles on alternate sides
	- [[Corresponding Angles]]: Relationship between interior and exterior angles. Lies on the same side of the transversal and lie either above or below
