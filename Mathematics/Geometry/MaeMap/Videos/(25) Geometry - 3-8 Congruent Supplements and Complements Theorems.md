	- Congruent Supplements Theorem
		- T.3) If two angles are supplements of the same angle, then they are congruent.
	- Definition of Supplementary Angles
		- $\angle A$ is supplementary to $\angle C$ and $\angle B$ is supplementary to $\angle C$ 
			- so $m\angle A + m\angle C = 180 \degree$ and  $m\angle B + m\angle C = 180 \degree$
	- Congruent Complements Theorem
		- T.4) If two angles are complements of the same angle, then they are congruent.
