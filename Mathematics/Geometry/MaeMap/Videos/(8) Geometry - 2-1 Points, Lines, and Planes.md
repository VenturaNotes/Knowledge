	- Point - Location, or position
		- 0 dimensions
	- Line - Series of points in the direction
		- 1 dimension
		- Represented with a lowercase letter? 
	- Plane - flat surface
		- 2 dimensions (such as height and width or length and width)
		- You need a minimum of 3 points to make a plane. There is exactly 1 plane through any 3 points (that do not lie within the same line)
			- With 3 points, there are 6 different combinations you could name the plane
	- Collinear - point lies on the same line
		- A and B are collinear. B and C are collinear. A and C are collinear
	- Coplanar - Points that fall on the same plane
		- A, B and C are coplanar because they all fall on the same plane
	- Best way to think of space is with a cube
		- Space is boundless
		- Space would be like extending the cube out into infinity
		- A cube is a solid however and does not extend out infinitely into space (but it sits and rests in space)
		- A cube is made up of many different planes. If we took a piece of paper as a plane, that plane can pass through the cube (many different ways)
		- Space or a solid figure would be 3-dimensions
	- "In geometry, point, line, and plane are considered undefined terms because they are only explained using examples and descriptions." [^1]
	-  A line contains points. A plane contains lines and points. Space contains planes, lines and points
