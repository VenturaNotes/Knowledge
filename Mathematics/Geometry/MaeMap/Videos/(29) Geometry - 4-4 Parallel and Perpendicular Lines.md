	- Perpendicular: Lines joined or intersected at right angles
		- Lines could be segments, rays or lines that go on forever in any direction
		- Perpendicular lines have 4 right angles and all the angles are congruent and you have sets of adjacent angles
			- $\perp$ 
		- Line p $\perp$ line l
			- Read as "line p is perpendicular to line l"
	- Parallel: Lines within the same plane that never intersect
		- Distance between 2 parallel lines is always the same
		- $\parallel$ is the symbol for parallel lines
		- Line l $\parallel$ line p
			- Read as "line l is parallel to p"
		- $\nparallel$ is read as "not parallel to"
