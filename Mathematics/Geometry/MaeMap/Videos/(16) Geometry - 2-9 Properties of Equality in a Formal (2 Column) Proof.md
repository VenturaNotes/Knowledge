	- Reflexive Property: For every number a, a=a
	- Symmetric Property: For all numbers a and b, if a =b, then b = a
	- Transitive Property: For all numbers a, b, and c, if a=b and b=c, then a = c
	- Addition and Subtraction Properties: For all numbers a, b, and c, if a=b then $a+c = b+c$ and $a-c=b-c$
	- Multiplication and Division Properties: For all numbers a, b, and c, if a=b, then $a*c = b*c$ and (c$\neq$ 0) $\frac {a}{c} = \frac {b}{c}$
	- Substitution Property: For all numbers a and b, if a=b, then a may be replaced by b in any equation or expression
	- Distributive Property: For all numbers a, b, and c, $a(b+c) = ab + ac$ 
	- Two-Column/Formal Proof: each step is a statement organized in two columns
		- Usually statements and reasons
	- Tow-Column Proof Example
		- $2*4$ is the same thing as 8 which can be considered a substitution (or simplification)
			- Same thing goes for $16-8$
