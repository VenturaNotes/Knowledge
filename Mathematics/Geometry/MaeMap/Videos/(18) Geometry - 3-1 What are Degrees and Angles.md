	- Degree: A way we can measure an angle
		- It's a number with a circle as a superscript (1$\degree$)
	- Angle: Formed by 2 rays extending from the same endpoint
		- Endpoint of both rays is known as the [[vertex]] (single)
		- There are also <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sides</mark> of an angle (2 sides)
	- $\angle$ represents angle
		- In $\angle zxy$, the center "x" would be the vertex
