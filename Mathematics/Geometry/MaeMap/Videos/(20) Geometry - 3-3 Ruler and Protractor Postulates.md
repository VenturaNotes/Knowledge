	- Ruler Postulate
		- P.9) The points on a line can be matched one to one with the real numbers. The real number that corresponds to a point is the coordinate of the point. The distance between points A and B is written as AB and is the absolute value of the difference of the coordinates of A and B.
	- Protractor Postulate
		- P.10) Consider $\overset \longleftrightarrow {AB}$ and point C on one side of $\overset \longleftrightarrow {AB}$. The ray $\overset \longrightarrow{AC}$ can be matched one to one with the real numbers from 0 to 180. The measure of $\angle CAB$ is written as $m\angle CAB$ and is equal to the absolute value of the difference between the real numbers matched with $\overset \longrightarrow{AC}$ and $\overset \longrightarrow {AB}$ on a protractor
			- m stands for the measure of an angle
