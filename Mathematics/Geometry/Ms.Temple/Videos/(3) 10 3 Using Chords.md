	- Using Chords
	- Geometric shapes
	- Diameter
		- JL 
	- The radii are equal when a right angle is made.
		- Therefore, M = 7
		- This also means the "11x" and "70 + x" arcs are equal

	- Since "C" is a center point, and there are lines that go down to "$\overline{QR}$" and "$\overline{ST}$" which are the same length and form a right angle, then "CU" and "CV" are the same length
		- Therefore, 2x = 5x-9
	- Then just use pythagorean theorem
