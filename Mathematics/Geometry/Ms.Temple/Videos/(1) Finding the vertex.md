	- Finds the vertex of a quadratic equation
	- Vertex is the point of a graph where the direction changes
	- Vertex Formula
		- $-\frac {b}{2a}$
			- This finds the x-intercept
	- In $y = 3x^2 + 6x - 3$, we know graph opens up because the leading coefficient is positive
	- The vertex found is a minimum because the y-values won't go lower

	- Vertex is a maximum number because it's as high as it can go
