	- There is a [[central angle]] because it starts at the center of the circle and goes out
	- $\overline {AC}$ is one of the two radii
	- The $m\angle ACB$ = 90$\degree$
		- $m\angle$ tends to represent the [[(21) Geometry - 3-4 Right, Obtuse, and Acute Angles|measurement of an angle]]
		- Since the central angle is 90$\degree$, we also know that the arc length is also 90$\degree$
			- This is called a [[minor arc]] $\overset {\huge\frown} {AB}$
	- Major arc $\overset {\Huge \frown}{ADB}$
