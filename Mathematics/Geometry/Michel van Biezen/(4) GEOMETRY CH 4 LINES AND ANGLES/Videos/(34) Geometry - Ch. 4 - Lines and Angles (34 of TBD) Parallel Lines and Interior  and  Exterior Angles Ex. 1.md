	- In each case determine if $a||b$
		- If corresponding exterior angles are congruent, parallel
		- vertical angles are congruent means parallel?

		- 2 consecutive interior angles are supplementary
			- Alternate interior angles are congruent but lines clearly not perpendicular so information not consistent with two lines being parallel (visually)
