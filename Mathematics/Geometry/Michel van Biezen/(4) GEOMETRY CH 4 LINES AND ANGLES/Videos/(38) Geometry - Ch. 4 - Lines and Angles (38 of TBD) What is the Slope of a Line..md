	- The slope of a line is defined as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change when traveling from one point on a line to a second point on the line that lies to the right of the first point
		- Top graph
			- Horizontal change
			- Vertical Change (positive)
		- Bottom graph
			- Horizontal change
			- Vertical change (negative)
	- Slope = vertical change over horizontal change
	- No slope is when the slope is 0 (just a horizontal line)
