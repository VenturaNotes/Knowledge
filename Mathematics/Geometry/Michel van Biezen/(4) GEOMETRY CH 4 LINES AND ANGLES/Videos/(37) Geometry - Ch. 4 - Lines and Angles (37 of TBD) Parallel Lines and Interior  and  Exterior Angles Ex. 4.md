	- a||b
		- Consecutive interior angles add up to 180$\degree$
		- My answer
			- 114 + 66 = 180 making a||b due to them being consecutive interior angles
	- b||c
		- Vertical angles are congruent
		- Corresponding interior angles are congruent
		- My answer
			- Vertical angles makes 66$\degree$ on other side
			- Since we have congruent alternate interior angles, b||c
	- d||f
		- Corresponding exterior angles (alternate exterior angles?)
		- My answer
			- Corresponding angles are congruent (71+66=137)
	- e||g
		- Supplementary angles add up to $180\degree$
		- My answer
			- Corresponding angles congruent (43+71 = 114)
	- a||c
		- Consecutive interior angles is 180 (66 + 114 = 180)
