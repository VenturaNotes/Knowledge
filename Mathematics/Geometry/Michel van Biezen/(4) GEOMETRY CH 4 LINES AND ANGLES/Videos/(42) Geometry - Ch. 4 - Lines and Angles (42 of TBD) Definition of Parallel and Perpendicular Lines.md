	- How do we know if two lines are parallel or perpendicular to one another?
	- Two lines are parallel if and only if the slopes are equal to each other
	- Two lines are perpendicular if and only if the slope of one is the negative inverse of the slope of the other
		- If you multiply both slopes together, you'll get negative 1
