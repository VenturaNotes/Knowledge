	- If a condition is true, then we can make this conclusion
	- The condition applies therefore the conclusion applies
	- Example
		- If an angle < 90$\degree$, then the angle is acute
		- The angle measure = 45$\degree$, therefore the angle is acute
	- Example
		- If 2 angles are opposite angles, then they have the same measure
		- Angles A and B are opposite angles, therefore, angles A and B have the same measure.
