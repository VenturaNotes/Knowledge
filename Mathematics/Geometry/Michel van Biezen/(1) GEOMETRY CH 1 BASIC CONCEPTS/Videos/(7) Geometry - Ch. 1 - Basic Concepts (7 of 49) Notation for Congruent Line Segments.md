	- When 2 line segments have the same length they are congruent (they do not need to be parallel)
	- Length of $\overline {AB}$ is the same as the length of $\overline {CD}$ 
		- Therefore AB = CD
			- Read as "The length of line segment AB is equal to the length of line segment CD"
	- Line Segment $\overline {AB}$ is congruent to line segment $\overline {CD}$
		- Therefore, $\overline {AB}$ $\cong$ $\overline {CD}$ 
	- Adding tick marks could also represent that 2 line segments have the same length
