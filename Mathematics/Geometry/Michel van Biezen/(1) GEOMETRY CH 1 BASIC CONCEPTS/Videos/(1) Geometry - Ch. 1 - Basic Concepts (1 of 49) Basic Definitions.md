	- [[Point]]
		- No dimensions
		- Drawn as a dot
			- $\textbullet^A$
	- [[Line]]
		- 1 Dimension
		- Line with 2 Arrows
		- There is only 1 line that can be drawn through 4 points
		- Line AB = $\overset {\longleftrightarrow}{AB}$
		- Line is defined by plotting down 2 points and connecting those points with a line. Assuming arrows continue on either side, draw arrows to indicate they go on to infinity.
	- [[Plane]]
		- Can be defined by 3 points
		- 2 dimensions
		- Drawn as a Flat surface
		- There is only 1 plane connecting 3 points not on the same line
	- [[Collinear Points]]
		- Points on the same line (Points on Line AB are collinear points)
	- [[Coplanar Points]]
		- Points on the same plane (Points A, B, and C are on the same plane)
