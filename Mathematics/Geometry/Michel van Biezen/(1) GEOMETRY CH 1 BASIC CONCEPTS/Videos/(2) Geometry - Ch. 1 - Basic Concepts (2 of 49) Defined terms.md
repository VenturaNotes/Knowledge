	- Defined terms are terms that are clarified (defined) by using known words such as point, line, plane, etc.
	- Line Segment - Section of a line with 2 endpoints
		- It is finite
	- Ray - Section of a line with 1 endpoint
	- Opposite Rays - 2 rays emanating away from 1 point on the line ^5f986e
		- Emanate: **:**Â "to come out from a source" [^1]
		- Two rays are opposite rays, by definition, if [^2]
			- (1) they have the same endpoint, and
			- (2) their union is a line
	- Intersection of 2 lines is a point
	- Intersection of 2 planes is a line
		- As long as 2 planes are not parallel, they'll intersect
