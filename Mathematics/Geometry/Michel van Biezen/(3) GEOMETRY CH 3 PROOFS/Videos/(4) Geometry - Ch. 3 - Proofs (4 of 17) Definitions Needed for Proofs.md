	- [[Midpoint]]: The midpoint of a line segment is the point that divides a segment into two congruent segments
	- [[Segment Bisector]]: Is a point or line that intersects a line segment at its midpoint
	- [[Perpendicular Lines]]: If two lines intersect to form a right angle, then they are perpendicular lines
	- [[Congruent Angles]]: Have the same angle measure
	- [[Linear Pair]]: of angles share a common side and they are supplementary angles
	- [[Intersecting Lines]]: Share 1 and only 1 point
	- [[Complimentary Angles]]: The sum of their measures add up to $90\degree$
	- [[Supplementary Angles]]: The sum of their measures add up to $180\degree$
	- [[Angle Bisector]]: Ray that divides an angle into 2 congruent angles
	- [[Adjacent Angles]]: Share a common side
	- [[Vertical Angles]]: Are formed when 2 lines intersect and are opposite to one another.
		- Angle 3 is equal to angle 4
