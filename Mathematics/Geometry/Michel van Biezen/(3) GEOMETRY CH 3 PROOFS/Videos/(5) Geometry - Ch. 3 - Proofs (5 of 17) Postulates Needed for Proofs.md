	- A [[postulate]]: Is a rule in geometry that is accepted without proof
		- [[Linear Pair]]: of angles have angular measures that add up to $180\degree$
		- [[Ruler]]: The measure of a line segment is the difference between 2 points on the ruler
		- [[Segment Addition]]: AB + BC = AC
		- [[Protractor]]: The measure of an angle is the difference between 2 points on the protractor
		- [[Angle Addition]]: $m\angle 1 + m\angle 2 = m\angle 3$
		- [[Line]]: Any two points form a line
		- [[Intersecting Lines]]: Any intersecting lines share 1 and only 1 point
		- [[Plane]]: Any 3 non-linear points form a plane
