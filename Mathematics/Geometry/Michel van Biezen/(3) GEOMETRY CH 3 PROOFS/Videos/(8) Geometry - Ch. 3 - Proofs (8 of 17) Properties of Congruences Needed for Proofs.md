	- Properties of Congruences: Applied to line segments, angles, and right angles.
	- If $m\angle1$ and $m\angle2$ are vertical angles (when the intersecting lines create an angle of $90\degree$)
		- Then 
			- (1) They are congruent
			- (2) Their measure = $90 \degree$ 
	- If $m\angle 1 = 90\degree$ and $m\angle 2 = 90\degree$ 
		- Then
			- (1) They are congruent
			- (2) They are right angles
