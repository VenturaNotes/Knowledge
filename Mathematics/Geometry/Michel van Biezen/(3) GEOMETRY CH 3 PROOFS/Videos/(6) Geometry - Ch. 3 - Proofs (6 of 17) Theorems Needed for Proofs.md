	- A [[Theorem]] is a statement that can be proven. Once proven, it can be used in other proofs
		- (1) [[Congruence of Segments]]: 
			- Reflexive: (For any segment AB, $AB \cong AB$)
			- Symmetric: If $\overline {AB} \cong \overline{CD}$, then $\overline {CD} \cong \overline{AB}$
			- Transitive: If $\overline{AB} \cong \overline{BC}$ and $\overline {BC} \cong \overline{CD}$, then $\overline{AB} \cong \overline{CD}$
		- (2) [[Congruence of Angles]]: Transitive if $\angle1 \cong \angle2$ and $\angle2 \cong \angle3$, then $\angle1 \cong \angle 3$
			- Would just call it the Transitive Theorem (of angles?)
		- (3) [[Congruence of Right Angles]]: All right angles are congruent
		- (4) [[Congruent Supplements]]: If 2 angles are supplementary to the same angle, then they are congruent
		- (5) [[Congruent Compliments]]: If 2 angles are complementary to the same angle, then they are congruent
		- (6) [[Congruent Vertical Angles]]: All vertical angles are congruent
