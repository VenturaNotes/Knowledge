	- In the previous videos, we have used inductive reasoning by:
		- 1) Finding a pattern
		- 2) Perform observations (examples or trends)
		- in order to: Draw a logical conclusion
	- Weaknesses of inductive reasoning
		- 1) Small sample may not represent a large population
		- 2) Incorrect original assumption
		- 3) Bias of original premise
		- 4) Presumption without basis or validity
		- 5) Opinion instead of observation
