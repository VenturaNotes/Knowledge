	- "The laws of nature are but the mathematical thoughts of God." - Euclid (of Alexandria )
		- Greek mathematician and philosopher who lived about 300 years before christ.
	- Euclid is the father of geometry (not because he was the first person to study geometry. The very first humans may have studied geometry by looking at twigs on the ground crossing)
		- "Geo" is Greek for Earth
		- "Metry" Greek for measurement
			- metric system
		- What made him the father of geometry was his writing of Euclid's Elements
			- This was published around 300 bc with 13 volumes
				- In the 6 books concerned with planar geometry (from a geometrical point of view made proofs here)
			- Arguably the most famous textbook of all time
				- Second most printed textbook of all time (behind the bible)
			- Did a rigorous, thoughtful, logical march though geometry and number theory and solid geometry (geometry in 3 dimensions)
	- Greek mathematicians such as Pythagoras became more thoughtful
	- Euclidean Geometry
	- Left picture is Raphael's impression of what Euclid may have looked like while teaching in Alexandria 
	- Euclid's Elements
		- First translation of English version was done in 1570 (shown to right)
		- Greek $\rightarrow$ Arabic $\rightarrow$ Latin
		- Started with basic assumptions (axioms or postulates)
			- From this, he deduced other statements or propositions (sometimes called theorems)
			- Able to prove things true and not true
				- Made rigorous proofs
		- Had about 2000 years after Euclid (incredible shelf life)
			- You were considered uneducated if you did not read and understand Euclid's elements

	- Direct quote from Abraham Lincoln. He studied Euclid's Elements to understand the meaning behind "demonstrate"
	- Geometry is one of the most fundamental and real mathematics we'll do
	- Arithmetic is really more computation
	- Math is about making assumptions and then deducing other things from those assumptions
