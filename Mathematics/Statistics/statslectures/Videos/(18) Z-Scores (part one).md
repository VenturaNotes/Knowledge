	- Z-Scores
		- Standardized values that can be used to compare scores in different distributions
		- Example
			- For the past two years, Joe has been in a bowling league.
			- First Year Stats
				- League Average = 181
				- Standard Deviation = 12
				- Joe's Score in Final Game = 187
			- Second Year Stats
				- League Average = 182
				- Standard Deviation = 6
				- Joe's Score in Final Game = 185
			- Compared to the rest of the league, in which year was Joe's score in the final game better?
		- Z score tells us how many standard deviations we are above or below we are the mean
		- Z score found that the 185 is better than the 187 when comparing all the other scores within that year. This is how the raw score (185 and 187) can be inaccurate when compared to z-score
