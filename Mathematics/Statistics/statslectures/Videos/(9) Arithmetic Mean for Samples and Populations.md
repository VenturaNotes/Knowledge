- The Arithmetic Mean is a single value meant to "sum up" a data set.
	- Example #1
		- Let's say you have this data set:
			- 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5
		- What single value best represents this data?
		- To calculate the [[mean]], add up all values, then divide by the total number of values you have

		- For the data set, we found the mean to be 2.8
	- Example #2
		- Find the mean for the following data set:
			- 15, 29, 31, 32, 41, 42, 49, 56, 57, 61

		- We find a larger mean of 41.3, which makes sense because the numbers in this new data set are much larger than those in the original data set.
- There are two types of arithmetic mean: population mean, and sample mean
	- They're calculated the same way, but there are important differences in how they are written
		- Population mean
			- $\mu$ 
		- Sample mean
			- $\overline {X}, M$
	- Pay attention to this now, because it will be very important later
	- These formulas are both doing the same thing, but use different annotation (notation?):
		- Population Mean
			- $\mu = \frac {\Sigma x}{N}$
				- Said the sum of all x divided by the number of x we have.
		- Sample Mean
			- $\overline{X} = \frac {\Sigma x}{n}$
		- Remember that N represents the size of a population, and n represents the size of a sample.

		- For this sample data set, what value best represents this data? To calculate the mean, add up all values, then divide by the total number of values you have
