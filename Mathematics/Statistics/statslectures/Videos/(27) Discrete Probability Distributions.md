	- [[Discrete probability distribution]]
	- [[Random Variable|Random Variables]]
		- Remember that values of random variables are determined by chance
	- Let's say I create a random variable called "T"
		- T = Number of Tails
	- If you flip a coin once, your [[sample space]] is heads and tails since you will only get one or the other
	- 50% chance to get 1 tails, 50% chance to get 0 tails.
	- [[Probability distribution]] (basically lists all the [[event|events]] that can occur, and the probability of each of those events)
		- A probability distribution displays the probabilities associated with all possible outcomes
		- What would the probability distribution look like for one roll of a six-sided die?
	- Important terms
