		- Imagine that you reached into a bag of candy 16 times and pulled out the following colors of candy. Record your results in a bar graph.
			- Sample data set:
				- Red, Green, Green, Green, Blue, Blue, Red, Blue, Green, Green, Red, Red, Blue, Green, Red, Red
		- Notice the bars not touching each other. If the bars were touching, it would not be a bar graph. It would be a histogram
- Pie Charts
	- A pie chart is a circle divided into sectors, where each sector represents a category of data that is proportional to the total amount of data collected.
		- What is a proportion?
			- A proportion is a part considered in relation to its whole.
			- For example, imagine a pizza with 8 slices. Your friend takes and eats 3 slices. In this case, 3/8 is the proportion of the pizza your friend took. This can also be represented as a decimal. 3 / 8 = 0.375
