- Central Tendency refers to the measure used to determine the "center" of a distribution of data. It is used to find a single score that is most representative of an entire data set.
	- 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5
	- If we could pick a single value to represent this sample data set, what ways could we do it?

	- The Mean
		- Data Set:
		- To find the mean, add up all values, then divide by the total number of values you have.

	- The Median
		- Data Set
		- To find the media, first put all the values in order (this has been done already). Next, find out what value lies in the middle. 
		- What happens when there are two values in the middle? Find the median by calculating the mean of the two values.

	- The Mode
		- Data Set
		- To mode is simply the most frequently occurring value.
		- For this data set, 2 is the mode because it occurs the most frequently.

			- What if more than one value occurs the most?
			- Data Set: 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5
			- This data set is bi-modal: it has two modes, 2 and 3
			- A data set with more than one mode can also be described as multi-modal
- What should you use?
	- Mean will be used for almost all occasions. However, outliers can sometimes interfere with usage of the mean.
		- An outlier is a value that is very different from the other data in your data set.
	- Examples
		- Data Set: 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5
			- Mean = 2.8
			- Median = 2.5
			- Mode = 2
		-  Data Set: 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 5, 500
			- Mean = 48
			- Median = 3
			- Mode = 2
			- In situations with many outliers, the mean is not a good measure of central tendency. The median or mode should be used instead, depending on the type of information you're dealing with.
