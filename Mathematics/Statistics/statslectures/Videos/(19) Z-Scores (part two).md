	- The Empirical Rule for Normally Distributed Data
- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-29 at 10.45.10 PM.png]]
	- Let's say we have a random variable, x, distributed as such:
		- I want to know: What percentage of scores fall above 4.25
	- Can convert the 4.25 into a z-score
		- Need to know
			- x
			- population mean
			- population standard deviation
	- A z-score of 0.25 means that a score of 4.25 is about 0.25 standard deviations above the mean
		- With z-score, we can find the blue-shaded area

	- Z Table
		- Shows us all the proportions and areas associated with different z-scores:
			- [[Body]]: Bigger Area
			- [[Tail]]: Smaller area
		- Always deals with area in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Body</mark> in example Z Table. However, some tables may give area of Tail
			- Could also tell the area between the mean and Z
- Important Terms
	- Z-Score
	- Body
	- Tail
