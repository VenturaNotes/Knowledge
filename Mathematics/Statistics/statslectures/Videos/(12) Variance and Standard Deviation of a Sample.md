- Measures of Dispersion: Variance and Standard Deviation of a Sample
- The previous lecture was about how to calculate [[variance]] and [[standard deviation]] for a [[Population (Statistics)|population]]. This lecture is about how to calculate <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">variance</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">standard deviation</mark> for a [[sample]].
- In the future, you will be dealing almost entirely with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">samples</mark>. You will deal with known <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">population</mark> values very rarely.
- It is very important to understand the difference between the two.
- What now follows is how to calculate the variance and standard deviation for a sample, using the same data set as in the previous lecture.

	- Data Set A and Mean
	- Data Set B and Mean
	- You have two data sets with the same mean, yet they're very different. How are they different?
	- Dispersion refers to how spread out a data set is about the mean

	- Variance and Standard Deviation are the two main measures of dispersion within a data set

	- Calculating Sample Variance
	- Denominator is "n-1" because without would cause us to underrepresent what it actually is

	- We just calculated Variance and Standard Deviation using Definitional Formulas, which takes a long time. To speed things up, we usually use the Computational Formulas instead. They get us the same answers, and we don't have to work as hard.
