- Probability is about determining the likelihood of events
- Independence of Events
	- Two events are independent if they do not affect one another
	- For example: rolling a "five" and then rolling a "three" with a normal six-sided die.
		- These events are independent because rolling a "five" does not change the probability of rolling a "three" (it is still 1/6). The same is true the other way around.
- Two events are dependent if they do affect one another.
	- For example: drawing a "king" and then drawing a "queen" from a deck of cards, without putting the king back.
	- These events are dependent because drawing a "king" changes the probability of drawing a "queen". Without the king in the deck the probability of drawing a queen changes from 4/52 to 4/51.

	- What is the probability of rolling a "5" and then a "3" with a normal six-sided die?
		- To answer this, we have the Multiplication Rule for Independent Events:
			- $P(\text{A and B}) = P(A) * P(B)$
	- What is the probability of drawing a "king" and then drawing a "queen" from a deck of cards, without putting the king back?
		- To answer this, we have the General Multiplication Rule for Dependent/Conditional Events:
			- $P(\text{A and B}) = P(A) * P(B|A)$
				- P(B|A): Probability of B given that A has already occurred
