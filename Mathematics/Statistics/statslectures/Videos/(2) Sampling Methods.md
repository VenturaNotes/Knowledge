	- How do we select from the population what goes into our sample?
- Ways of representing sample and population sizes
	- N: used to represent the size of your population
	- n: used to represent the size of your sample
- Example
	- Let's say you want to find the average GPA of a student at your university. Your university has 20,000 students, and you select 100 students and ask them their GPAs.
		- What are N and n?
			- N = 2000
			- n = 100
- The goal of sampling is to create a sample that is representative of the population it is being drawn from
- The most basic sampling method: [[Simple Random Sampling]]
	- When performing simple random sampling, every member of the population (N) has an equal chance of being selected for you sample(n)
	- Arguably the best sampling method, as your sample is almost guaranteed to be representative of your population
	- Hardly ever used due to being too impractical
		- Need to know every single person in your population
- [[Stratified sampling]]
	- When performing stratified sampling, the population(N) is split into non-overlapping groups ("strata"), then simple random sampling is done on each group to form a sample(n)
	- One example of this would be splitting a population of students into men and women, then sampling from each of the two groups
	- This may allow us to collect the same amount of information as simple random sampling, but use less people.
- [[Systematic Sampling]]
	- When performing systematic sampling, every nth individual from the population(N) is placed in the sample(n).
	- For example, if you add every 7th individual to walk out of a supermarket to your sample, you are performing systematic sampling
	- Convenient for when you cannot obtain a frame of the population you wish to study
- [[Convenience Sampling]]
	- When performing convenience sampling, easily obtained individuals from the population(N) are placed in the sample(n).
	- Simply put, in this type of sampling, you pick the easiest way of getting your sample. This type of sampling is sometimes called [[voluntary response sampling]], because individuals often select to be a part of the sample.
	- This can be a problem, because there may be a difference between people who choose to participate and people who don't
