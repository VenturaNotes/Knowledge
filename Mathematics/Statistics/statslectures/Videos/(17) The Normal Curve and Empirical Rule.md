	- In the past, I've used bar graphs to display discrete data
	- And histograms to display continuous data

	- The distributions of most continuous random variables will follow the shape of the normal curve
	- Probability, value
	- Mean, median, and mode all exist at the center.
	- The graph changes direction at inflection points
		- When you're one reflection point from the mean, it marks 1 standard deviation from the mean
	- These points mark how many standard deviations you are from the mean
	- [[Empirical Rule]]:
		- 68% of all values fall within 1 standard deviation of the mean
		- 95% of all values fall within 2 standard deviations of the mean
		- 99.7% of all values fall within 3 standard deviations of the mean-
	- Using empirical rule, we can find out what area is associated between different distances 
	- Parts are 2.5%, 13.5%, 34%, 34%, 13.5%, 2.5%
- Important Terms
	- Continuous Random Variable
	- Normal Curve
	- Empirical Rule
