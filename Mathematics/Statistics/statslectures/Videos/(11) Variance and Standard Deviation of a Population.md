- Measures of Dispersion: Variance and Standard Deviation of a Population
- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-28 at 8.24.15 AM.png]]
	- Data Set, Mean
	- You have two data sets with the same mean, yet they're very different. How are they different?
	- Dispersion refers to how spread out a data set is about the mean.
- Variance and Standard deviation are the two main measures of dispersion within a data set.
	- Population Variance
		- $\sigma^2$ = $\frac {\Sigma(x - \mu)^2}{N}$
	- Population Standard Deviation
		- $\sigma$ = $\frac{\sqrt{\sigma(x - \mu)^2}}{N}$
	- Notice N, $\mu$, and $\sigma$

	- We just calculated Variance and Standard Deviation using Definitional Formulas, which takes a long time. To speed things up, we usually use the Computational Formulas instead. They get us the same answers, and we don't have to work as hard
