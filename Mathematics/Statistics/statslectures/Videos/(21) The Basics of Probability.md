- Probability is a measure of the likelihood of an event
- If I flip a coin, what's the probability of the coin landing on tails?
- Probability = $\frac {\text{\# of ways an event can occur}}{\text{\# of possible outcomes}}$
- A sample space is a collection of all possible outcomes
	- S = {Heads, Tails}
- Probability(Tails) = $\frac 12$ = .50
	- Probability = 0.50
		- 50% chance of the coin landing on tails
	- Probabilities will always be between 0 (0%) and 1.00 (100%)
- An event with a probability of 0 is impossible (it will never occur)
- An event with a probability of 1 is certain (it will always occur)
