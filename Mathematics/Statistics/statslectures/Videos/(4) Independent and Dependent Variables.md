- A variable is a property that can take on many values.
	- In a situation with multiple variables
		- An independent variable is any variable that is being manipulated
		- A dependent variable is any variable that is being measured.
- Imagine that researchers want to test the effectiveness of a new weight loss medication. They split participants into three groups: one group gets a 0mg dosage (control), one group gets a 50mg dosage, and the last group gets a 100mg dosage. After six months, the participants' weights are measured.
