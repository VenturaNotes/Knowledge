- 65% of all statistics are made up (joke) 
- You can present information in a way that is beneficial to you
	- Polls you see on TV like 35% is doing this 
		- Need to be careful when just listening to conclusions drawn
		- Everything depends on how that data was collected
			- Who did they ask?
			- How did they phrase the question?
			- How was the data collected and analyzed?
		- This matters because you can pretty much take any batch of data, and massage it look favorable for me (or at least influence someone to think the way you think)
	- [[Statistics]] is by and large the process of collecting information, collecting data
		- Most of the time it's numbers of some kind
		- Presenting that in lots of different ways
		- And drawing conclusions from that data
	- Take 30 people in a classroom and determine what their average height is (5'7)
		- Can we draw any broad conclusions from that?
		- Can we extrapolate that the average height in the U.S. is 5'7 from that?
		- Maybe the average height of Texans? 
		- Can taking such a small little sample be representative of everyone in the whole world
			- Of course not!
			- Bad to say every location would have a similar distribution
		- Need to be careful how you take data and what conclusions you draw from it.
		- What happens if you measure 1000 people?
			- Better but not great
		- This is because there are regional variations around the world
		- There are different average heights of people in Asia vs Europe vs Australia vs America
		- If we took our 1000 person sample in middle of U.S., it would work good there but nothing in german height b/c genes different in different parts of the world
		- If we select a million people, should select these people from different pockets of the world to find average worldwide (maybe based on proper percentages of their population)
		- If we look at a billion people in our sample, we're getting very close to truth.
		- If we measure everyone in the world, of course we have our answer
	- When we do statistics, we are measuring something (height of people in this case)
		- We want to draw larger conclusions from our sample
	- Calling 250 people to ask who they're voting for is not enough people to extrapolate data for U.S. (need to be careful who you ask in telephone survey)
		- did you call everyone who lived in a certain city? (different economic environment?)
		- Need to ask enough people to get [[statistical significance]] (collected enough information to draw conclusions)
		- Need to ask a broad cross-section of people
		- Need to ask people from Florida, Texas, and Ohio
		- If you just collect data from old people (>60), data might be skewed (without you knowing it if data presented in this way)
			- When you get to certain age, you worry about certain things
			- Might think/vote in a certain way
		- Would give you a different result than if you asked a broad cross-section of ages
	- Statistics: The process of collecting information (usually numerical data)
		- Happy to have information from small sample of data (more interested in using information to make broad conclusions about a larger set of data)
		- Impractical to ask everybody a question
		- Ask a small sample and then we go from there and extrapolate
- Course about learning and collecting data
- Learning about what makes sense when we ask those questions
- How to calculate things about that data to draw those conclusions
