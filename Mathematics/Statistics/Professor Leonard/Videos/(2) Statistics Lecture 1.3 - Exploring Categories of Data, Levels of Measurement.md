- Two types of data you can collect. Stuff that has to do with numbers and stuff that does not have to do with numbers
- [[Qualitative]] (categorical like categories) Non-Numeric
	- Examples
		- Color
		- Religion
		- Race
		- Gender
		- Ethnicity
		- Don't ascribe a number to these topics
		- Political preference
		- Area Codes
		- Phone numbers
		- ID Numbers
		- zip code
			- Doesn't make sense to use operators on zip codes
			- Bigger numbers west, smaller numbers east for US
			- Even though it has a number, it's not necessarily quantitative
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Mathematical operations are meaningless</mark>
- [[Quantitative]] (Numerical)
	- Examples
		- Age (subtracting age tells you who's older)
		- Height (6ft, taller shorter. Difference meaningful)
		- Weight (lbs not light, medium, etc.)
		- Wages
		- MPH
		- Temperature
		- Time (3:30PM vs 4:15PM}))
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Math operations are meaningful</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Two types of quant. Data:</mark>
	- [[Discrete Data]]: Countable or Finite
		- Examples:
			- number of eggs
			- Dice
		- Certain # of them or you can count it
		- Finite: certain # of things to pick from
		- Countable: you can count them
		- You can count # of eggs that pop out
		- Easy to count
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Usually a 'count' of something</mark>
		- Dice have 6 sides
			- No 7, 8, or 4.3
			- Finite number to choose from (1,2,3,4,5,6)
			- Even if a die is (3.14) or (3.22).
	- [[Continuous Data]]: Infinite # of possible values (not countable)
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Usually a measurement</mark>
			- continuous because a measuring tool can get more and more specific.
			- temp: 95° not exactly. Could be 95.1°
			- Between any range of numbers, unlimited numbers you can pick 
				- 95 and 96, could have 95.1.
				- Could be between 95 and 95.1. Can get really specific but can't count all that up. Infinite number of possibilities within there
			- Not easy to count
			- Examples
				- Inches on a ruler.
					- ![[Screenshot 2022-11-29 at 1.09.49 AM.png]]
					- A # between 1 and 2 is 1.1
					- A number between 1 and 1.1 is 1.01
					- And you can keep finding numbers between other numbers
				- Temperature
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">4 levels of measurement</mark>
	- [[Nominal]]: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Categories Not Ordered</mark> (Just list it out)
		- Examples
			- Race
			- Gender
			- Religion
		- Kind of means name
		- by name only
		- Quantitative and qualitative can be categorized using these measurement also
		- Can't put religion in any order
		- All you can do is ask someone their religion. Just list them. Can't do math on it
	- [[Ordinal]]: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Can be ordered, Differences are meaningless</mark>
		- Data that can be ordered
		- Examples
			- Rank
			- Colors (Spectrum)
				- Can be ordered but can't subtract
		- Lets say you have 4 cars in a NASCAR race
			- Will get rank in end (1st, 2nd, 3rd)
			- They can be ordered
			- Ranking doesn't tell you how much better they did
			- Tells you 1 order ahead but doesn't say time ahead finished. Doesn't tell you how much better. No information. Doesn't tell you how they drove. If you subtracted rank, just tells you differences in rank
		- Rank colors spectrum scale. Subtract yellow from green to get blue.
	- [[Interval]]: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Ordered, differences are meaningful, No "Natural" zero</mark>
		- Examples
		- A lot of times scale based
			- Temperature
				- Finding difference of degrees is meaningful. Tells you scale-wise version of how much warmer/colder it is. Can put it in order. 95 is hotter than 65
		- Natural Zero
			- get a zero? You have absolutely none of that quantity
			- Bank account 0 means no money
			- If thermometer reads 0, this does not mean absence of all temperature. Doesn't mean there's no heat whatsoever. It's like a sliding zero. In Fahrenheit, 0 is not a natural 0. You can go above or even below that.
			- Natural 0 means there is nothing there
	- [[Ratio]]  <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Just like Interval, but w/ a natural 0</mark>
		- Amount of money
		- Natural 0 means there is nothing of that category or value anymore
