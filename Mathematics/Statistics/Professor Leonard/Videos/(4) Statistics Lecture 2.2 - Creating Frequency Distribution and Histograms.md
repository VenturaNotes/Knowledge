- Chapter 2 shows how we collect the data
- Now organize
- and then how to summarize it
- Frequency distribution?
- Count brown vs black vs blond and put in list
- Frequency distribution example

| BLOND | 7   |
| ----- | --- |
| BRB   | 15  |
|  BLK     | 12    |

- Classes (groups) are the hair colors and frequency is how often something occurs
- [[Frequency Distribution]]: A list of values w/ corresponding frequencies
	- Will be based on numbers
	- (Will make it based on ages for class)
- [[Class Width]]: Difference between two "lower class limits"
	- [[Lower Class Limit]]: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Smallest value belonging to a class</mark>
		- (where the class starts. If you have a group of 18 to 21 year olds, 18 will be the lower limit)
	- [[Upper Class Limit]]: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Largest value in a class</mark>
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Steps</mark> (when creating your own frequency distribution)
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">1. Determine # of classes: 8</mark>
		- (don't want to have few groups (can't differentiate) or too many (too cumbersome))
		- 8 classes for example
		- Won't see trends if you make class for every single person
	- (when creating your own frequency distribution)
	- Class Width: $\frac{MAX\space VALUE - MIN\space VALUE}{NUMBER \space OF \space CLASSES }$
