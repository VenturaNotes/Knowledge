	- [[Census]]: Data gathered from every member of the population
	- [[Sampling Frame]]: A list of elements belonging to the population from which the sample will be drawn. Sampling frame (should be identical to population) but that is not always practical
	- [[Sampling plan]]: Method used to select elements of the sample
	- [[Judgement Sample]]: Used as a known population characteristic to validate sample
		- If you know that the average height of the people in your population is $5'9$, then you pick a sample and test/question a small group of people in your sample and then see if you get the same result as your total population. If you don't, you don't have a good sample because it should represent the population
	- [[Probability Samples]]: Each subject in the sample is picked based on probability
	- [[Random Sample]]: Each subject has an equal probability of being picked
	- [[Systematic Sample]]: Pick every $10^{th}$ or every $100^{th}$ element of the population
	- [[Stratified Sample]]: Categorize the population in groups and pick a number from each group (strata)
	- [[Cluster Sample]]: Only pick from certain strata and not others
