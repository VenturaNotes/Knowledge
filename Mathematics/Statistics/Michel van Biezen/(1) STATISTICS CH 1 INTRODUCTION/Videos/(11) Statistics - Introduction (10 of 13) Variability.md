	- The accuracy of statistical results depend on the variability of the collected data. (will we get the same result each time we take a measurement)?
	- Sources of variability
		- (1) Tool measurement is not precise (the scale is too coarse)
		- (2) The tool is not calibrated
		- (3) The zero-setting is off
		- (4) Tool has a random/[[systematic error]]
			- Systematic error
				- Basically adds 2 or 3% to every measurement so more weight you put on a scale, the greater the difference between the true value and the measured values
		- (5) The scale is not accurate
		- (6) Multiple measurements of the same data point yields different answers
		- (7) Sample size is too small
