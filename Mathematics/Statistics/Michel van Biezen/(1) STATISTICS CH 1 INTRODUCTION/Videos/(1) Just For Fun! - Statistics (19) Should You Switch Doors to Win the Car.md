	- Scenarios (Three doors where one has a car behind it)
		- (1-Loss) Car in middle and you choose middle
			- Right or left cup removed and you switch to the wrong cup
		- (2-Win) Car in middle and you choose left
			- Right cup removed so you choose middle
		- (3-Win) Car in middle and you choose right
			- Left cup removed so you choose middle.
	- There is a 66% chance you win with this strategy because you have a 66% chance of choosing the wrong door the first time.
	- Always switch if they show you one of the doors with nothing behind it. Then there is a two-thirds chance the price will be behind the other door that you didn't pick the first time
