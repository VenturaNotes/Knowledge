	- "Let me count the ways..." "As the number approaches infinity..."
	- The problem of misuse can be summarized by the use of statistics not for finding out what is actually going on but instead use it to misrepresent the data in order to support a viewpoint or to deliberately misrepresent in order to create a false perception or a false narrative.
		- (A) Data mining $\rightarrow$ sifting through the data to pick only the data that support personal opinion and to reject the data that doesn't
		- (B) Selective survey questions $\rightarrow$ Use question that can only be answered in a predictive, supporting manner
		- (C)Unrelated cause and effect $\rightarrow$ Ignoring other (possibly more relevant) causes
			- Ex: Effect of living near high voltage power lines
		- (D) Choice of graph type and shape $\rightarrow$ enhancing the desired appearance
		- (E) Grouping and presentation $\rightarrow$ Combine (like very much, like, somewhat like)
			- If you only have one "dislike" choice, then the representation may not be accurate
		- (F) Scaling of Data $\rightarrow$ Choice of scale can misrepresent (small changes made really big)
