- Displaying Quantitative Data
	- [[Histogram]]: A bar graph for quantitative data, where the horizontal axis is a number line. Bars should be touching
	- [[Frequency Polygon Ogive]]: Straight lines connecting midpoints. Line Graph connecting upper class boundaries
	- [[Stem Plot]]: Leaves are last significant digit and stem is all other digits. Retains data.
	- [[Dot Plot]]: A dot is placed above each data label for each data value. Retains data.
	- [[Line Graph]]: Used to show values of a variable over time. Time is the horizontal axis.

- Will display quantitative data either by hand or Excel

- Histogram
	- A histogram is like a bar graph because it shows how frequently each range of values occur. However, because the data is quantitative, the horizontal axis is a continuous number line, therefore histogram bars should be touching. You can display the frequency or relative frequency. You may be asked to use the class midpoint or class boundaries but using the entire class range is perfectly acceptable.

- Frequency Polygons and Ogives
	- These two have nothing to do with one another but are rarely used in the real world
	- A [[frequency polygon]] is a visual display created by plotting a point at the frequency of each class above each class midpoint and connecting the points using straight lines
	- An [[ogive]] (pronounced "oh-jive") is a line graph which depicts the cumulative frequency of each class from a frequency table

- Stem Plot (or [[Stem and Leaf Plot]])
	- A stem plot is similar to a histogram but retains the data values. To create a stem plot, we use the last significant digit as the leaf and all other digits as the stem. Always include a key for interpretation. While you can make a stem plot in Excel, there is no "stem plot" chart option. Therefore, it is time-consuming. We will just create one by hand using this data
		- Helpful because you can see how long the bars are in relation to one another (similar to a histogram)
		- If you had 2 different distributions, it would give a nice visual between the 2

- [[Dot Plot]]
	- A dot plot also retains the original data, but instead of ranges of data, we only group data values that are exactly the same together. Creating a dot plot consists of adding a dot above a number line for each occurrence of each data.
		- Not easy to make in excel
		- Can think of histogram

- [[Line Graph]]
	- Line graphs are used to show changes over time. The horizontal axis is a timeline containing equal intervals of time. The vertical axis records the measurement of the variable being recorded.
- CPI stands for consumer price index
