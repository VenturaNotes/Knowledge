- Experiments
	- Experiments are the only way to show a cause-and-effect relationship, but an experiment is only as good as its design. Let's start with (a lot of) terminology
		- [[Treatment]]: some condition applied to a group of subjects in an experiment
			- A treatment could be a prep course given out to students to help with an ACT exam
		- [[Subjects]]: people (also known as participants) or things being studied in an experiment
		- [[Response variable]]: the variable in an experiment that responds to the treatment
		- [[Explanatory variable]]: the variable we alter in an experiment that causes the change in the response variable
		- [[Control Group]]: A group of subjects to which no treatment or a placebo is applied.
		- [[Placebo effect]]: A response to the power of suggestion, rather than the treatment itself.
		- [[Treatment group]]: a group of subjects to which researchers apply a treatment

	- [[Single-blind experiment]]: subjects do not know if they are in the control group or the treatment group, but the people interacting with the subjects in the experiment know in which group each subject has been placed
	- [[Double-blind experiment]]: neither the subjects nor the people interacting with the subjects know to which group each subject belongs.
	- [[Confounding Variables]]: factors other than the treatment that cause an effect on the subjects of an experiment
		- Things at play that are not being measured. If measuring someone's cholesterol, confounding variables could be the subjects diet if all that is being measured is a pill to help reduce cholesterol
	- [[Institutional Review Board(IRB)]]: a group of people who review the design of a study to make sure that it is appropriate and that no unnecessary harm will come to the subjects involved
	- [[Informed consent]]: involves completely disclosing to participants the goals and procedures involved in a study and obtaining their agreement to participate.

- How to design an experiment
	- (1) Randomize the control and treatment groups
	- (2) Control for outside effects on the response variable.
		- Like confounding variables
	- (3) Replicate the experiment a significant number of times to see meaningful patterns

- Analyze an Experiment
- Consider the following for the scenario you are about to read:
	- Identify the explanatory and response variables.
	- What is the treatment?
	- Which group is the treatment group and which group is the control group?
	- What is the purpose of administering saline to Group B?
	- Is this a single-blind or double-blind study? Do you think this is the best choice for this study?

- Explanatory variable: Intravenous dose of vitamin C
- Response variable: amount of nerve pain reported
- Treatment: The dose of vitamin C they get
- Treatment Group: Group A (getting administered vitamin C)
- Control Group: Group B (administered saline)
- Purpose of administering saline is to be a placebo to reduce bias
- This experiment is a single-blind. Double-blind is usually better because we want to reduce any kind of human error as we can. A nurse knowing might influence a participant's reaction. Nurse might ask "how are you" more concerningly if part of the treatment group
