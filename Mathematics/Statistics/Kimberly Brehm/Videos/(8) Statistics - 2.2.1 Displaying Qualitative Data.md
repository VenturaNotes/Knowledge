- Displaying Qualitative Data
	- [[Pie Chart]]: Shows how large each category is in relation to the whole
	- [[Bar Graph]]: Bars represent the amount of data in each category
	- [[Pareto Chart]]: A bar graph with bars in order of descending frequency
	- [[Side-By-Side Bar Graph]]: A bar graph that compares the same categories for different groups
	- [[Stacked Bar Graph]]: Compares the same categories for different groups and shows category totals

- Will display qualitative data either by hand or using Excel. Most examples use "Housing Types" data.

- Pie Chart
	- A pice chart uses the relative frequencies from the frequency distribution to divide the "pie" into different-sized wedges, calculated by multiplying 360$\degree$ by the relative frequency of each class and rounding to the nearest whole degree for each central angle.

- Bar Graph
	- A bar graph shows how frequently each category is chosen in qualitative data. The horizontal axis should be the categories and vertical axis the frequency. Bars in a bar graph should NOT be touching. Instead of creating a bar graph by hand, lets use Excel

- Pareto Chart
	- A Pareto chart is just a bar graph arranged from greatest to least, as we already have in our Housing Types bar graph here. If you need o make a a Pareto chart, simply rearrange the data from greatest to least first, then follow the stops for a bar graph

- Side-By-Side Bar Graph
	- Recall a side-by-side bar graph is great for comparing differences in the same variables from two different groups. Let's create a side-by-side bar graph of the two data sets in our Chapter 2 Data
