- Major Parts:
	- Linear Spaces
	- Linear Maps
	- Euclidean Spaces

	- Applications
- Structure
	- every two lectures are followed by one tutorial
- Base field
	- during the whole course we will work over the field $\mathbb{R}$ of real numbers.


## Vector space
- Definition: A vector space (over $\mathbb{R}$ ) is a [[(Video) Linear Algebra - n-Tuples and R to the n|tuple]] $V = (V,., +,\overset \rightarrow 0)$ , where
	- consisting of 4 elements
		- V is a set
		- $\overset \rightarrow 0 \in V$
			- The 0 vector is an element in V
		- $.:\mathbb{R} \times V \rightarrow V, \text { written } (\lambda, v)$ 
			- "." is a binary operation
