- $\mathbb{R}^2$ is 2 dimensions
- $\mathbb{R}^3$ is 3 dimensions
- In 2 dimensions, we have a surface
	- Area
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 3.59.32 AM.png]]
- In 3 dimensions we have height added to the surface (giving volume)
	- Such as a cube
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 3.59.25 AM.png]]
- In 1 dimension, we have one direction
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 3.59.51 AM.png]]
	- Just 2 straight lines

## n-tuples
- For n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$, an ordered n-[[Tuple|tuple]] of real numbers is given $$(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n) \text{ such that } x_1,x_2,x_3,..., x_n \in \mathbb{R}$$
- An n-tuple is a set of numbers that are real numbers
	- $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers
- Example: for n=1 $\mathbb{R}$

Example: for n=2 $\mathbb{R}^2$

	- Described using the xy axis
	- The ordered pair is a 2-tuple pair
	- It is a coordinate in $\mathbb{R}^2$ 
		- We have 2 dimensions, an x axis and a y axis.
- Example for n=3 $\mathbb{R}^3$ 
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 4.38.51 AM.png]]
		- 3-tuple triple
- Ex: for n=5 $\mathbb{R}^5$
- $\mathbb{R}^0$ -> A single point. Call it 0.

## Intuitive Interpretation of Dimensions
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 4.42.38 AM.png]]
	- It's possible to intuitively think of higher dimensions as some kind of configuration space you're working with. You can configure your arm in 27 dimensions
		- Making the arm go left and right is 1 kind of dimension
		- Moving arm up and down is 3 dimensions
		- Rotating the arm is 4 dimensions
		- Twisting at elbow is 5 dimensions
		- Curl fingers is 6 dimensions
		- Rotate each finger is 7 dimensions
- Configuration space of sphere is 3 dimensions because.
	- up and down
	- left and right
	- Configuration space is 3 dimensions
- $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow$ is the set of all possible n-tuples
	- $\mathbb{R}^1$ is a line
	- $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a surface
	- $\mathbb{R}^3$ is 3 dimensions
- $P(x_1, x_2, ... x_n)$ 
- $Q(y_1,y_2, ...,y_n)$
- dist(P,Q) = $\sqrt{(y_1 - x_1)^2 + (y_2-x_2)^2 + ... (y_n - x_n)^2}$
