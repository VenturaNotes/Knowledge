	- The Situation
		- Two suspects are arrested.
		- The police think that they were trying to rob a store
			- But the cops can only prove that the suspects were trespassing
		- Thus, the police need one of the criminals to rat out the other.
	- The Potential Deal
		- If no one confesses to robbery, the police can only charge the prisoners for trespassing.
			- Punishment: 1 month of jail each.
		- If one confesses and the other doesn't, the police will be lenient on the rat and severely punish the quiet one:
			- Punishment: 12 months in jail for the quiet one; 0 months for the rat.
		- If both confess, the police punish both of them equally
			- Punishment: 8 months in jail each
	- The Question
		- Suppose the thieves only want to minimize the number of months they spend in jail. Should they confess to the police?
		- The Prisoner's Dilemma
			- Player 1 is a man and Player 2 is a Woman. We say this so we can use pronouns such as he/she between players.
			- Player 1 is always better confessing. If Player 2 kept quiet, Player 1 confessing would result in 0 months of jail time rather than 1 month of jail time if Player 1 kept quiet. If Player 2 confessed, Player 1 would be better of confessing as well he'd get 8 months of jail time instead of 12 months if he were to keep quiet.
			- The one sensible outcome is for both players to confess. Even though (-1, -1) is a better option for both of them, is because each of them can individually do better by switching to confess. It's in their individual interest.

	- Strict Dominance
		- Strategy x strictly dominates strategy y for a player if x generates a greater payoff than y regardless of what the other players do.
			- Confessing strictly dominates keeping quiet
			- Keeping quiet is strictly dominated.
		- Rational players never play strictly dominated strategies.
			- Why play y when you can play x instead?
