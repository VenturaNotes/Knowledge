## Strictly Dominant Mixed Strategies
- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-07 at 9.25.02 PM.png|500]]
	- Player 1 has 3 strategies and Player 2 has 2 strategies

## Strict Dominance and Mixed Strategies
- If you find a mixture between two strategies (or more) strictly dominates another strategy, eliminate that last strategy immediately.
- Strictly dominated strategies are irrational, whether pure strategies or mixed strategies dominate them.

	- Player 1 would be better off choosing "Up" and "Down" 1/2 the time than choosing the middle because the average when Player 2 chooses left is "1" and the average when Player 2 chooses right is "1/2" which are both better than 0 if Player 1 chose "middle". We can get rid of the middle because it's a strictly dominated strategy.

	- We found that the mixture of 1/2 and 1/2 for player 1 is better than playing middle.
	- Mixture found in Nash equilibrium is better than middle for player 1
