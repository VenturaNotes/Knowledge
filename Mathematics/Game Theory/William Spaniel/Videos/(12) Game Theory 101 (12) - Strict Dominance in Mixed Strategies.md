	- Strictly Dominant Mixed Strategies
		- Player 1 has 3 strategies and Player 2 has 2 strategies
	- Strict Dominance and Mixed Strategies
		- If you find a mixture between two strategies (or more) strictly dominates another strategy, eliminate that last strategy immediately.
		- Strictly dominated strategies are irrational, whether pure strategies or mixed strategies dominate them.
	- Payoff Matrix
		- Player 1 would be better off choosing "Up" and "Down" 1/2 the time than choosing the middle because the average when Player 2 chooses left is "1" and the average when Player 2 chooses right is "1/2" which are both better than 0 if Player 1 chose "middle". We can get rid of the middle because it's a strictly dominated strategy.

	- New Payoff Matrix
		- We found that the mixture of 1/2 and 1/2 for player 1 is better than playing middle.
		- Mixture found in Nash equilibrium is better than middle for player 1
