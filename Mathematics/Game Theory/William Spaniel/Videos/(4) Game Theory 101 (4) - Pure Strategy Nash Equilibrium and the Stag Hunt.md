## The Game
- Two hunters go out to catch meat
- There are two hares in the range and one stag. The hunters can each bring the equipment necessary to catch one type of animal.
- The stag has more meat than the hares combined, but both hunters must chase the stag to catch it.
- Hare hunters can catch all of their prey by themselves.

## Stag Hunt
- Payoff matrix

	- There is not a strictly dominated strategy for either player here.

## Nash Equilibrium
- A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player has incentive to change his or her strategy.
	- We only care about individual deviations, not group deviations
	- Nash equilibria are inherently stable.
		- What you are doing is optimal given what I am doing and vice versa
		- No regrets.

## Stag Hunt
- There are 4 different outcomes
- There can always be more than 1 Nash Equilibrium in games.
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-07 at 7.43.27 PM.png|400]]
		- There is a Nash equilibrium where they both hunt a stag and there is a Nash equilibrium where they both hunt a hare.
			- Nash equilibrium is not always efficient/good but they are inherently stable and no one would regret hunting hares in this case given the other player will do the same thing.
