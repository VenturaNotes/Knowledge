	- Battle of the Sexes
		- For pure strategy Nash Equilibrium, we can see that for (1, 2), the payoff for Player 1 is 1 and the payoff for player 2 is 2
	- How to Calculate Payoffs
		- (1) Find the probability each outcome occurs in equilibrium
		- (2) For each outcome, multiply that probability by a particular player's payoff
		- (3) Sum all of those numbers together
	- (1) Find the probability each outcome occurs in equilibrium.
		- Take 1/3 that Player 1 will go to the ballet and multiply it by 2/3 that Player 2 will go to the ballet and you get 2/9
			- Player 2's mixed strategy is independent of Player 1's mixed strategy
			- Do this for each additional cell.
			- All the probabilities must sum up equal to 1
	- (2) For each outcome, multiply that probability by a particular player's payoff.
		- For player 1

		- For player 2
	- It's a good exercise to compare the payoffs of a mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium to the payoffs in a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
		- We learn that it's actually worse for the players to selected the mixed strategy rather than the pure strategy which is less favorable to a particular player
		- If we think of the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium as the conflictual outcome where the players can't agree on anything, this is actually worse for player 1 than just conceding the issue to player 2.
			- Player 1 prefers being at the fight to being at the ballet with player 2.
			- But if player 1 did mixed, he would only make 6/9 or 2/3 of a point. In contrast, he could just be like hey player 2, lets meet at the ballet.
				- That's better for him that winding up in mixed strategy Nash equilibrium
