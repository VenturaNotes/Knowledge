## The Story
- A man and a woman want to get together for an evening of entertainment, but they have no means of communication.
- They can either go to the ballet or the fight.
	- The man prefers going to the fight.
	- The woman prefers going to the ballet.
	- But they prefer being together than being alone.

	- (1,2) and (2,1) are both at Nash equilibrium

	- When Player 1 plays ballet with probability of 1/3 and fight with probability of 2/3, Player 2 is indifferent between choosing ballet or fight

	- This gives us a mixed strategy equilibrium where player 2 is mixing with probability 2/3 on ballet and 1/3 on fight. Player 1 is playing ballet with probability 1/3 and fight with probability 2/3

## Solution
- There are 3 Nash Equilibria
	- Mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium
	- 2 pure strategy Nash Equilibria
- It would be nice if there was some way to compare the pure strategy Nash Equilibria to mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium
	- There is no obvious payoff for the mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium
	- We just know what the equilibrium looks like. What the players actually do. We don't know the welfare of the players when they do play this mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium
	- Will learn how to calculate payoffs which will allow us to compare the relative welfare of the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium vs the pure strategy Nash equilibrium
