## Formal Definition
- A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player has incentive to change his or her strategy given what the other players are doing.
	- A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is when players do not randomize between two or more strategies.

## But What Does that Mean?
- A Nash equilibrium is a law that no one would want to break even in the absence of an effective police force.
	- Pretend the police do not exist.
	- The government passes a law.
	- The law is a Nash equilibrium if everyone would want to follow it.

## Think about Traffic
- In some situations, following stoplights is a Nash equilibrium. ()
	- Suppose two cars are driving at each other from perpendicular directions
	- The stoplight is red for one of them and green for the other.
	- If the police could not ticket the drivers, would they want to break the law?
		- No

## Stoplight Game

	- Two pure Nash equilibrium strategies
	- They follow the law because it is in their own self-interest to follow the law.

## Nash Equilibrium, Intuitively
- A Nash equilibrium is a law that no one would want to break even in the absence of an effective police force.
