	- The Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
	- Mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium was for player 1 to move up with probability 1/6 and down with probability 5/6. Player 2 has probability of playing "Left" 1/3 and probability of playing "Right" 2/3.
	- Do not write in decimal format for fraction $\sigma_L = 0.33$ as this will create a contradiction in the calculations
