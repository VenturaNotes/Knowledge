	- The Game
		- Two generals have three units
		- They simultaneously decide how many units they should allocate to an upcoming battle.
			- Or, either side can unilaterally opt out of the battle
		- The side with more units at the battle wins. If they have the same amount or at least one decides not to play, then the game ends in a draw.
	- Safety in Numbers
		- Each player has 4 strategies
	- Best Responses
		- Given what all other players are doing, a strategy is a best response if and only if a player cannot gain more utility from switching to a different strategy
		- A game is in a Nash equilibrium if and only if all players are playing best responses to what the other players are doing.
	- Payoff Matrix
		- Player 1's best responses are marked off with $*$
		- Nash equilibrium is a box with 2 stars.
			- They are mutual best responses
