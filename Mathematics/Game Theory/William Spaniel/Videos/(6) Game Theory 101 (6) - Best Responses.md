## The Game
- Two generals have three units
- They simultaneously decide how many units they should allocate to an upcoming battle.
	- Or, either side can unilaterally opt out of the battle
- The side with more units at the battle wins. If they have the same amount or at least one decides not to play, then the game ends in a draw.

## Safety in Numbers

	- Each player has 4 strategies

## Best Responses
- Given what all other players are doing, a strategy is a best response if and only if a player cannot gain more utility from switching to a different strategy
- A game is in a Nash equilibrium if and only if all players are playing best responses to what the other players are doing.

## Payoff Matrix

	- Player 1's best responses are marked off with $*$
	- Nash equilibrium is a box with 2 stars.
		- They are mutual best responses
