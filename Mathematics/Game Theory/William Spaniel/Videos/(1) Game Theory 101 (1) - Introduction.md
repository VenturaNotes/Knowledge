## What is Game Theory?
- Definition: the study of strategically interdependent behavior
	- Strategic interdependence: what I do affects your outcomes and what you do affects my outcomes.
- Not just about winning and losing (though it could be).

## Why Study Game Theory?
- (1) The logic of strategically interdependent situations gets extremely complicated extremely fast.
	- Game theory gives us "accounting" tools.
- (2) Game theory alls us to quickly draw parallels from one situation to another.
	- This will allow you tot think on your feet much better than you can today.

## Chapter 1: The Basics
- Topic: simultaneous move games
	- Examples: soccer penalty kicks, prison interrogation, deciding whether to stop or drive at a stoplight
- Items covered: strict dominance, iterated elimination of strictly dominated strategies, pure strategy Nash equilibrium, best responses, mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, weak dominance.

## Chapter 2: Extensive Form Games
- Topic: games where players take turns moving.
	- Examples: war, invasion plans, police searches.
- Items covered: backward induction, subgame perfect equilibrium, credible threats, tying hands, commitment problems, forward induction.

## Chapter 3: Advanced Strategic Form Games
- Topic: everything from chapter 1, except generalized.
	- Examples: Does a striker kick left more frequently as his accuracy improves on the left side?
- Items covered: Comparative statics, knife-edge equilibria, and symmetric, zero-sum games.

## Prerequisties
- Game theory is logically demanding but rarely requires more than high school algebra
- It will help if you have a semester's worth of calculus.
	- Don't worry if you don't-you will only miss out on the last 5% of the course.

## Grading
- This is a free, online class.
	- Let's not take ourselves too seriously.
	- I'm already giving you an A!
