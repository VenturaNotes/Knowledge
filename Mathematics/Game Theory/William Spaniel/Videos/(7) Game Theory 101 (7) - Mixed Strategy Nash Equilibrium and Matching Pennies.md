	- Matching Pennies
		- You and a friend simultaneously reveal a penny
		- If both pennies show heads or both show tails, your friend has to pay you $1.
		- If one penny shows heads and the other shows tails, you have to pay your friend $1.
	- Payoff Matrix
		- This is a diametrically opposed game. A zero-sum game because all the outcomes add up to 0. 
		- This is the same as Penalty Kicks for Soccer where you have a Goalie and a Striker
	- Nash's Theorem
		- There must be at least one Nash equilibrium for all finite games.
			- But here there are no equilibria in pure strategies.
		- But there's another type of equilibrium!
	- Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
		- If no equilibrium exists in pure strategies, one must exist in mixed strategies.
		- A mixed strategy is a probability distribution over two or more pure strategies.
			- That is, the players choose randomly among their options in equilibrium.
			- If mixtures are mutual best responses, the set of strategies is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium

	- Matching Pennies Example
		- Suppose you were playing matching pennies against a mind reader.
		- How can you avoid losing?
		- Answer: Flip the coin
			- At best, the mind reader could only win half the time.
	- Payoff Matrix
		- We use probability of 0.5 since we'll be flipping the coin.
	- Weighted Matching Pennies
		- However, we can't usually just guess this coin flipping strategy. It's not that easy.
		- If we change the strategy around a little bit. We weighted the results so that if the coins matched on heads, you would win $3 and your friend would lose $3. If matched on tails, no difference. 
		- Can't just look at this payoff matrix easily and decide that if I flip my coin, everything is going to be fine.
			- In this particular case, it's not fine. 
			- Opponent would want to strategize against you if she knew that you were flipping the coin
		- So we need to develop a way of solving for this sort of situation more generally. What we need to do that is something called a [[mixed strategy algorithm]] which we get to in the next video.
			- This algorithm we'll be using all the time in the future to solve for mixed strategy Nash Equilibrium
