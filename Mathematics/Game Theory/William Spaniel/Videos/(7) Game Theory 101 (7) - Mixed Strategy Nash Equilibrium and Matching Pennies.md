## Matching Pennies
- You and a friend simultaneously reveal a penny
- If both pennies show heads or both show tails, your friend has to pay you $1.
- If one penny shows heads and the other shows tails, you have to pay your friend $1.

	- This is a diametrically opposed game. A zero-sum game because all the outcomes add up to 0. 
	- This is the same as Penalty Kicks for Soccer where you have a Goalie and a Striker

## Nash's Theorem
- There must be at least one Nash equilibrium for all finite games.
	- But here there are no equilibria in pure strategies.
- But there's another type of equilibrium!

## Mixed Strategy Nash Equilibrium
- If no equilibrium exists in pure strategies, one must exist in mixed strategies.
- A mixed strategy is a probability distribution over two or more pure strategies.
	- That is, the players choose randomly among their options in equilibrium.
	- If mixtures are mutual best responses, the set of strategies is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium

## Matching Pennies Example
- Suppose you were playing matching pennies against a mind reader.
- How can you avoid losing?
- Answer: Flip the coin
	- At best, the mind reader could only win half the time.

	- We use probability of 0.5 since we'll be flipping the coin.
