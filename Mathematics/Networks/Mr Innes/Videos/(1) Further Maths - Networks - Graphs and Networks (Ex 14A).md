-  A network graph is a visual representation for a series of events or how a system might flow information or items. It can also be used to demonstrate how you get from one point to another
- Networks are a new form of mathematics. Only been around the last 100 years
- Useful for google maps (quickest route to get from point A to point B)
- Planar Network graph

		- Match the words to the parts of the graph above
		- [[Loop]] (or node)
			- A line that connects from one of those dots back to the same dot
		- [[Weight (Graphs and Networks)|Weight (Graphs and Networks)]]
			- Indicates a # that has been attached to a line. It just means it has some value
			- You can consider it like a map and its distance
		- [[Isolated vertex]] (or isolated node)
			- A vertex that doesn't have any edges[^1]
		- [[Vertex]]
			- Dots on the network map (graph)
		- [[Edge]]
			- Lines that connects the dots in the network graph are referred to as edges
		- [[Adjacent Vertices]]
			- If referring to 2 dots (vertices) that are attached to the same edge, they are referred to as adjacent vertices.
		- [[parallel edges (multiple edges)]]
			- If referring to 2 edges that are connected to the same vertices (2 parallel lines from the same dots)

	- Match the types of multigraphs with their descriptions. One description per graph
	- [[Degenerate graph]]
		- No edges in graph. Only made of vertices
	- [[Subgraph]]
		- Part of a larger graph (contains some or all of the edges/vertices of a graph)
		- It is important when identifying a subgraph that it has the same connections from the same vertices
	- [[Disconnected Graph]]
		- Some vertices are not reachable from other vertices
		- Network has some vertices connected by edges but there are 2 or more distinctly different sections that are not connected together by a bridge
			- A bridge is an edge that connects 2 vertices together if they're connecting separate network graphs
	- [[Complete Network]] (or complete graph)
		- All vertices are directly connected to all other vertices without parallel edges or loops. $E = \frac{V(V-1)}{2}$ 
			- A is connected to B,C,D
			- B is connected to A,C,D
			- C is connected to A,B,D
			- D is connected to A,B,C
	- [[Simple graph]]
		- No loops or multiple / parallel edges
		- Examples #1 and #3 are simple graphs
	- [[Connected graph]]
		- every vertex is connected to every other vertex either directly or indirectly
		- Examples #1 and #3 are simple graphs
	- Example #3
		- It has a bridge between D and E
		- It connects 2 sections of graph

	- Planar Graphs
	- Example 3: Graph 1 and 2 are planar graphs but Graph 3 isn't. What do you think the pattern is?
		- Clue: They might need to be redrawn. Redrawn graphs are called "isomorphic graphs"
	- Graph 1 has no overlapping edges
		- Graph 2 and Graph 3 both have edges that overlap with the others
	- A [[planar graph]] must be any graph that can be drawn such that there are no overlapping edges. 
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Can we redraw graph 2 with no overlapping edges?</mark>
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Eliminate an edge and redrawing it</mark>
				- Example is shown to have redrawn an edge
				- You can consider the edges to be flexible (they don't have to be straight lines)
				- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-14 at 8.32.58 PM.png]]
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Or move a vertex</mark>
		- It is impossible to redraw graph 3 with no overlaps
			- There is no way to determine by sight if there are too many overlaps
			- One way we can figure it out though is to check how many sets of lines overlap
				- If graph has only 1 set of overlapping lines, it is likely that it can be redrawn
				- If it has multiple sets of overlapping lines, it is less likely to be redrawn
		- We can see if there is some sort of planarity (whether or not it can be planar) by using Euler's rule

	- Which graphs below can be redrawn to be planar?
	- We discover that the first one is nonplanar because we cannot redraw those edges

	- Degree (Order)
	- Example 5: If Vertex C has a degree of 2, Vertex D has a degree of 3 and Vertex E has a degree of 4, state the other degrees and explain what "degree of a vertex" means.
		- Vertex C has a degree of 2 and has 2 edges going to it
		- Vertex D has a degree of 3 and has 3 edges connected to it
		- Vertex E has a degree of 4 but only has 3 edges connected to it
			- It has 4 entrance ways because you can enter through the left of the loop or the right of the loop
	- [[Degree of a vertex]]
		- The number of edges that connect to the vertex
			- The category is how many times or how many entrance ways are there to that vertex
	- Therefore,
		- A has a degree of 2 (2 edges connected)
		- B has a degree of 3
		- F has a degree of 4
	- Sometimes you'll hear networks being described as having an even or odd degree
		- Sometimes it will say that the vertices are odd
			- It means it has an odd number of entrance ways to that vertex
		- If it's an even degree or a vertex is even, it has an even number of entrance ways to that vertex

	- Euler's Rule for Planar Graphs:
		- F - E + V = 2
			- Where F = faces, E = Edges and V = Vertices
			- It must equal to 2 so that the graph is planar
	- Example 6: Confirm that the graph below is planar using Euler's Rule 
	- [[Face]]
		- Region of the graph that is bounded by edges or it is the area outside of the network
	- There are 4 faces in this graph
	- There are 8 edges
	- There are 6 vertices
	- 4 - 8 + 6 = 2
		- 2=2
	- Therefore, it is a planar graph
- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-14 at 8.51.46 PM.png]]
	- Convert the following into a planar graph and confirm its planarity by using Euler's Rule
	- We moved the vertex E outside and we redrew the edges. 
	- There are 6 total faces
	- There are 12 edges
	- There are 8 vertices
		- 6 - 12 + 8 = 2
			- 2 = 2
	- Since 2 = 2, the graph is planar
- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-14 at 8.54.19 PM.png]]
	- Example 8: How many faces does the following graph have?
	- We can confirm there are 6 faces after redrawing the graph by either counting or confirming using Euler's rule by solving for "F".
	- There are 6 faces
	- There are 9 edges
	- There are 5 vertices
	- F - 9 + 5 = 2
		- F = 6
	- We can confirm that the graph has 6 faces
- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-14 at 8.58.16 PM.png]]
	- Example 9: A graph that is connected and is planar has 5 faces and 13 edges. How many vertices?
	- Just use Euler's rule to solve. The number of vertices would be equal to 10.
