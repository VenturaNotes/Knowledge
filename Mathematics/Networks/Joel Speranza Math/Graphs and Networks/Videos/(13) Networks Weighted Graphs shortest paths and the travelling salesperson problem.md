- To find the shortest paths between 2 points, you need to draw a weighted graph
- [[Weighted Graph]]
	- Each edge has been given a weight (number)
		- Weight could be a distance in km
		- Could be a time in minutes it takes
		- Could be a cost in terms of getting some information from one party to another party
	- Adding up all edges would give total weight of graph
- There is no shortcut to find the shortest path. Just need to trial & error through it
- We could just cross out the path with a weight of 20 between C and D since there is a path with a weight of 10 that gets you from C to D directly
- When finding the shortest path, find all the different routes systematically

	- You are a traveling salesperson. You need to get to every town exactly once
	- You need to get back to home town
	- Questions
		- Which town should you start and finish in?
		- Which roads should you take so that you travel the least km?
		- Easiest way to do it is to write a computer program for it and make the computer program start at F and try every combination of routes. Then other vertices and find that too
			- Need to brute force the answer
