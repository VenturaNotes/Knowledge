- Euler's Formula
	- Pronounced "oiler"
- Euler's Formula
	- For any connected planar Graph
		- v + f - e = 2
	- A connected graph means that all vertices need to be connected in some way
	- A planar graph means that it needs to be connected in a way so that the edges don't cross over
- A connected planar graph has 6 vertices & 9 edges. How many faces does it have? 
	- Can use the formula to solve this
