	- The 6 vertices are initially not connected so they're connected into a network now.
	- [[Isolated Vertex]]
		- Not joined to other vertices
		- Examples
			- F

	- [[Multiple Edges]]
		- 2 or more edges connecting 2 vertices
		- Examples (both have 2 roads)
			- A and C
			- D and F
	- [[Connected graph]]
		- all vertices connected in some way
			- No isolated vertices
	- [[Bridge]]
		- An edge that if erased would make the graph not connected
		- Example
			- Removing edge connecting B and D would make the graph no longer connected

	- [[Simple Graphs]]
		- No loops or multiple edges
- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-15 at 12.38.25 PM.png]]
	- [[Complete Graphs]]
		- All vertices connected to all vertices directly
		- There is something interesting about the degree of the vertices
