	- [[Hamiltonian Graph]]
		- A closed [[(10) Networks Trails and Paths#^fc09d6|path]] using every vertex
		- There is no way to tell if a graph is Hamiltonian unless you brute force every possibility
			- Would need to test every single vertex
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-15 at 1.46.46 PM.png]]
			- The above is a proved Hamiltonian graph
	- [[Semi-Hamiltonian Graph]]
		- An open path using every vertex
		- Example
			- C - B - H - G - D - E - F - A
