- Food network
- [[Digraphs]] (arrows are involved)
	- Arrows going from one vertex and into another vertex
	- Direction is involved
	- Only used when direction matters
	- [[Directed Graph]]
- [[Subgraph]]
	- It doesn't have everything from the original graph but a small subsection of it. Useful if you only want to study some relationships
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If you add something extra, it will stop being a subgraph</mark>
	- Adding another edge or vertex will make it no longer a subgraph
	- Shape that the subgraph is drawn doesn't matter that much
