- [[Equivalent Graph]] (isomorphic graph)
	- Will have the same vertices and edges but not crossing over
- Both are planar graphs
- [[Planar Graph]]
	- Any graph that can be drawn where the edges don't cross over
- [[Non-Planar Graph]]
	-  This is when the graph has overlapping edges that cannot be redrawn to not overlap.
- To draw a planar graph in planar form, just draw it without any edges overlapping
- [[Planar Form]]
	- A planar graph drawn with no edges crossing
