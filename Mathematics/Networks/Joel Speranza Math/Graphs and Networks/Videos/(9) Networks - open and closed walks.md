	- If someone goes from point A to point B to point C to point E, you can write the [[Walk|walk]] like this
		- A - B - C - E
		- This is called an [[Open Walk]]
			- Starts & Ends at different vertices
	- [[Closed Walk]]
		- Starts & Ends at same vertex
		- A - B - C - E - A
	- Arrows should be used to show direction that the walker is walking in

	- D - E - C - D - D - C - B
		- It is an open walk
		- Went to same vertex a number of times
		- Went on the same edge multiple times
		- If first and last letters are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">different</mark>, it's an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">open walk</mark>
		- If first and last letters are <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">same</mark>, it's a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">closed walk</mark>
	- Paths and trails will put restrictions on this
	- D - E - C - D - D -C - B - A - E - D
		- This is a closed walk
