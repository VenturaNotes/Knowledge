	- [[Semi-Eulerian Graph]]
		- 2 vertices with odd degree
		- An open trail using every edge is possible (but must start at odd degree vertex)
	- Start at an odd point, and you can travel along the edges. You can get to every edge exactly once but the problem is that you won't get back to where you started.
	- [[Semi-Eulerian Trail]]
		- A trail that covers every edge but is open (doesn't get back to where it started)
		- "The trail covering every edge of a graph only once (start finish different)"
		- Open trail
- Bridges of KÃ¶nigsberg
	- Historically notable problem in mathematics [^1]
