	- An [[edge-induced subgraphs|edge-induced subgraph]] can't have an isolated vertex
		- The first example is an edge-induced subgraph because it's a subgraph that consists of edges from the original graph and all of its vertices are vertices incident with the edges of the graph
			- Must have some edges and vertices only that are incident with those edges. Those are the endpoints of the edges.
		- Second example is also an edge-induced subgraph
