	- [[Empty Graph]]: Graph with no edges
		- Blank space
			- Sometimes will and won't be treated as a graph
			- 
		- isolated vertex
		- 2 isolated vertices
		- Empty graph on 3 vertices
			- $\overline {k_3}$
				- The empty graph on 3 vertices
				- It means the empty graph on 3 vertices is the complement of the complete graph of 3 vertices ($k_3$)
				- Also don't worry about it if you don't know what complements are. But I encourage you to look up both complete graphs and complements of graphs. I may have a lesson on one or both subjects
	- [[Trivial Graph]]: Graph that contains one isolated vertex
		- Empty graph on one vertex: $\overline {k_1}$ 
	- [[Null Graph]]: Graph with no vertices or edges 
		- It depends on author and book if it's a graph or not
		- Will often be used interchangeable with [[Empty Graph]]
