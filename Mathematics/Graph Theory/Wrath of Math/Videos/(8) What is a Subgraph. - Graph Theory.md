	- H is a [[subgraph]] of G iff everything in H is also in G
	- H is not a subgraph in the second example because it has an edge between the vertices 4 and 5 which graph G does not have.

	- By definition of a [[subgraph]], every graph G is a subgraph of itself.
		- Every graph is an [[improper subgraph]] of itself.
			- This is because it is equal to itself.
		- If H $\subseteq G$ and H $\ne$ G, then H is a [[proper subgraph]] of G
