	- [[Adjacent Edges]]
		- Edges "ab" and "bc" are adjacent because they're both [[incident]] with the vertex b  
			- For edges to be adjacent, they need to be incident with a common vertex
				- For an edge to be incident with a vertex means that vertex is an endpoint of the edge.
	- The edge "bc" is incident with "b" and incident with "c" because it joins b and c. That is what it means for 2 edges to be adjacent.
	- Which edges are adjacent
		- We have the graph $C_4$, it is a 4 cycle
	- Another often used notation would call this graph $S_4$, for the total number of vertices, instead of $S_3$, which has a 3 referring to the number of "external vertices" the star
		- $S_3$ is [[star graph]] on three vertices
			- It's true for all star graphs for all edges to be adjacent
