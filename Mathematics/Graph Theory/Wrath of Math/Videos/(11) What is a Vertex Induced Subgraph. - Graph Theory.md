	- A [[vertex-induced subgraph]] is sometimes just called an induced subgraph, however there are also [[edge-induced subgraphs]]
	- This is a subgraph of G but not a vertex-induced subgraph because there is no edge between vertices a and b even though there is one in G. This is true for first image
	- For the second image, it is a vertex-induced subgraph because every pair of vertices in the subgraph that is joined by an edge in the original graph is also joined by an edge in the subgraph

	- Same notation for edge-induced subgraphs if below was the edge set
		- $G[\{d, e, f, c\}]$
	- A vertex-induced subgraph shows all of the edges in the original graph for the vertices that exist in the subgraph
