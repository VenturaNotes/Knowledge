- Checking solution in differential equations
- Recall:
	- Solutions are equations so... Just take derivative(s) and plug in!
- Differential equations involve derivatives and solutions are equations themselves
	- Usually y = a function of x

	- y' is the first derivative of y
	- We have a differential equation (first order since only first derivative)
		- Has derivative
		- Has equation
	- Need to check if second equation is a solution to our differential equation
	- Take as many derivatives as necessary to match up the function given to the differential equation that we have. If you have 5th order, need to take the derivative 5 times.
		- Product Rule
		- Quotient Rule
		- Chain Rule
