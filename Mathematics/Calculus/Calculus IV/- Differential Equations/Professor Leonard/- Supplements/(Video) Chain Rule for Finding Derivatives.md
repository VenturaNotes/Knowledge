- Derivative of the composite function
	- This is when we have one function inside of another
- $\frac {d}{dx}(f[g(x)])$ 
	- The g is inside of f which makes it a composite function
	- Need to differentiate the outside portion of the function which is f
		- Need to keep inside the same and then multiply it by the derivative of the inside
