- f(x) = x$^n$ 
	- According to the power rule, the derivative of the above function is $$f'(x) = n*x^{n-1}$$

- If you get a rational function (a function), rewrite the expression. When moving the variable from bottom to top, it will get a [[(49) Exponents - What are they.#^cca671|negative exponent]] if it was positive in the denominator.
