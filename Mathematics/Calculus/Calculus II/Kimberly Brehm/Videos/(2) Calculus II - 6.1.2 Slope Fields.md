	- Section 1
		- Consider the differential equation: $$y' = F(x,y) = x^2+2x-4$$
		- We know that this equation gives us the slope of the solution at point $(x, y)$.
			- This is because the derivative is the slope of the curve at that point.
		- A [[slope field]] is a collection of short segments that represents the slope of the solutions. It shows the general shape and can be used to graph a particular solution, particularly when finding the solution analytically is difficult or impossible.
	- Section 2
		- Let's draw a slope field for $y' = x + y$. Plug (x, y) values into the differential equation, then graph a short segment that represents the slope at that point. 
			- Won't go too into depth with slope fields since we will typically use technology to create a slope field and most questions will be to match the slope field with its differential equation. 
		- The right image shows us the technology creating the slope field for us
		- The point of a slope field is that once we know what our initial condition is, we can get a good idea of what our curve is going to look like. 
			- Knowing what the initial condition is will help us know what the curve is going to look like.
