- Determine whether the sequence converges. If it does, find its limit.

		- For sequences only, we can reverse directions. Find limit first before whether it converges
		- If we can find the limit of a sequence and that limit exists, then by definition the sequence converges
		- Question rewritten: Find the limit of the sequence if it exists and use your answer to determine whether or not the sequence converges
		- Can use squeeze theorem to check if it converges and then determine limit

		- Easiest way to find a limit when we have a rational function is to deal with the numerator and denominator separately
			- The cosine function oscillates back and forth between -1 and 1 (we know that from the graph of cosine as well as the unit circle). Smallest value it obtains is -1 and largest value it obtains is 1

					- If we square cosine function, all values between -1 and 0 will be positive. squaring the left limit we get positive 1. Everything in-between will become positive values between 0 and 1

					- K represents limit going between 0 and 1
			- $2^n$ where n approaches infinity will give  an infinity large number

		- Because the limit exists and it's 0, we know that the sequence converges

			- This shows how the squeeze theorem works. We know that it approaches 0 so the only number between both 0s is 0. Because there is a limit of 0, it converges.
