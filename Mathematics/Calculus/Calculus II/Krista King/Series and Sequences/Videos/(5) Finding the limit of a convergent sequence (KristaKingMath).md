- Find the limit of the convergent sequence
	- Image
		- ln is the natural logarithm
		- Because the sequence converges, we know that the limit exists. This does not apply to series at all
		- By definition, if the limit exists, then the sequence converges. Since it's a convergent sequence, the limit will exist
