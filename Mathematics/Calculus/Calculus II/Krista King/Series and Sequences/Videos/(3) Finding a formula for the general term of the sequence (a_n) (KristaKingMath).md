		- Can look at the numerator first
		- To deal with alternation of positive and negative signs
			- If the series starts with a negative term (the first term), then you want to multiply your $a_n$ term by $(-1)^n$ 
			- Do $(-1)^{n-1}$ or  $(-1)^{n+1}$  if the sequence starts w/ positive
	- A sequence is an arrangement of numbers in a particular order. A series is the sum of the elements of a sequence. [^1]
