	- Slide 1
		- Prelude to instantaneous Rates of Change
			- Last Time: AROC for $y=f(x)$ on $[a,b]$:
				- Slope of secant line connecting (a, f(a)) and (b, f(b))
		- Today: Instantaneous rate of change for y=f(x) at x=a
			- If you try to use AROC formula from x=a to x=a, you'll get an undefined expression (not correct)
		- Back to [[secant line]]: Let h > 0 be small. Consider $[a, a+h]$
			- Find slope of secant line connecting (a, f(a)) and (a+h, f(a+h))
	- Slide 2
		- Slope of secant line connecting (a, f(a)) and (a+h, f(a+h))
			- $\frac {f(a+h) - f(a)}{a+h-a}$ = $\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$ 
				- AROC for f(x) on $[a, a+h]$
			- Called [[difference quotient]]
		- Idea: For h very small, $\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$ will be very close to [[instantaneous rate of change]] of $y=f(x)$ at x=a
