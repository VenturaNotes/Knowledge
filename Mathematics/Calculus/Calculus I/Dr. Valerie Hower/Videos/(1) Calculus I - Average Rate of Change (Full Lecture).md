	- Slide 1
		- Average rates of change
		- Q: What is [[calculus]]?
			- Possible answers: Limits, derivatives, integrals
		- A: Study of rates of change
		- Example
			- Rate of change: 25 = slope of line
			- [[Slope]]
				- m = $\frac {y_2 - y_1}{t_2 - t_1} = \frac{\Delta p}{\Delta t}$
		- Rate of change is the slope
			- Every rate of change can be interpreted as the slope
	- Slide 2
		- Example: I drive down a straight road with position function p(t) for a $\le$ t $\le$ b
		- Define: Average rate of change from $t = a$ to $t = b$
		- Slope of a [[secant line]]: line connects (a, p(a)) and (b, p(b))
			- Slope of secant line is the average rate of change on the interval
		- Can also say [[Average rate of change|AROC]] on the interval $[a, b]$ 
		- The [[speedometer]] tells you the [[instantaneous rate of change]]
	- Side 3
		- [[Velocity]] versus [[speed]]
		- p(t) [[position]]. Motion along a line
		- average rate of change of p(t): [[average velocity]]
			- Velocity can be negative, positive, zero
		- average rate of change of distance traveled: [[average speed]]
			- Always non-negative
	- Slide 4
		- Find the average rate of change of f(x) from x = 1 to x =3
		- Equation for [[secant line]]
			- Shown in [[point-slope form]]
			- Slope of secant line is the average rate of change of interval

	- Example: $g(y) = cosy$
		- Find the average rate of change of g(y) on $[\frac{\pi}{2}, \pi]$
		- Use [[Unit Circle]]
	- When the secant line is horizontal, the slope is 0
	- Find an equation of the secant line for the [[exponential function]]
		- Bases indicate graph
	- [[point-slope form]]
	- [[slope-intercept form]]

	- Assume a balloon stays [[sphere|spherical]] as it inflates. What is AROC of volume of the balloon with respect to surface are, as surface area changes from $4\pi in^2$ to $9\pi in^2$ 
		- Using V = $\frac 43 \pi r^3$
		- Using $S = 4\pi r^2$
