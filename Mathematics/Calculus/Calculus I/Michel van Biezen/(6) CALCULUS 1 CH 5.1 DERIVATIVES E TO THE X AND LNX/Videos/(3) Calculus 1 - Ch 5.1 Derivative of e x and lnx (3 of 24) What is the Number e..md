	- "[[e]]" is called the "natural number" because in nature, things tend to increase and decrease according to that number
		- When it increases, it grows exponentially
		- When it decreases, it decays exponentially
	- [[Population Growth]]
		- $N(t) = N_0e^{at}$
			- The number of any population is equal to the initial number and increases according to the function $e^{at}$ 
			- a is a constant
				- Increases or decreases steepness of curve
			- t is an independent variable
	- [[Investment Growth]]
		- $P(t) = P_0e^{at}$
			- [[Principal]] equals initial principal times $e^{at}$
				- Sometimes principal is known as amount
				- a determines steepness of curve (could represent [[interest rate]])
				- t is the independent variable
	- [[Current]] in a [[capacitor circuit]]
		- $I(t) = I_0e^{\frac {-t}{\tau}}$
		- As a capacitor fills up with charge the current decreases and will decrease according to exponential function
		- Will have a negative exponent and $\tau$ is the constant
	- Current in an [[inductor circuit]]
		- $I(t) = I_0(1 - e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}})$ 
		- [[Limiting growth curve]]
			- There is a maximum value that the current can get to. Exponentially arrives at maximum curve
