	- Errata
		- When solving for $\frac{dx_s}{dt}$, they forgot to write $\frac {4}{3}$ for the equation before the solution
	- Finding two things
		- How fast is the length of the shadow changing
		- How fast is the tip of the shadow moving along the sidewalk
			- This is the sum of the change of the length of the shadow per unit of time + the rate at which the walker is watching
			- $x_s$: the s stands for shadow here
	- Will use [[similar triangles]] here
