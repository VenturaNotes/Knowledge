	- The closer the points are together, the closer the slope of the secant line is to the slope of the tangent line.
		- This is the whole concept of the limit as it comes to derivatives
	- In the limit as we move the points Q and P closer together, the slope of the secant line will more closely resemble the slope of the tangent line.
		- In the limit when the points are brought together infinitely close, the slope of the tangent line will exactly equal the slope of the secant line
	- The derivative will equal to the slope of the tangent line which will equal to the secant line when brining the 2 points really close together
