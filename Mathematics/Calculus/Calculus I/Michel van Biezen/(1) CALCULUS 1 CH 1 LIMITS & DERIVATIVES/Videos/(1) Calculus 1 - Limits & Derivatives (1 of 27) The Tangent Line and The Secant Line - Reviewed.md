	- The tangent line is a line which touches the function at 1 point only 
		- Touches function once
	- The secant line is a line which runs along the function and touches it at 2 places
		- Cuts across a function
		- Touches function twice
	- When we bring the second point closer to the first point, we can see that the slope of the secant line will much more align with the slope of the tangent line. When you bring the points really close together, the slopes of both lines will be very close to one another
