	- When x=a, the tangent line touches the function f(x)
		- Tangent line only touches function at one location
	- We consider $\Delta x$ to be a really small distance
	- To find the slope of the function, we need to find the slope of the tangent line at a particular location of the function
		- Slope of tangent line will only equal slope of the function at one particular location
	- Slope of the tangent line can approximate the slope of a function, but not be exactly the same
	- Slope of a tangent line and slope of a function being close together will approximate the derivative of a function
		- because the derivative of a function is the slope of a function at a particular location
