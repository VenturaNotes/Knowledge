	- (1) Slope of a graph
		- Slope of a straight line function is the derivative
			- $y=mx +b$
	- (2) Slope of a [[tangent line]] to a curve
	- (3) Limit equation in algebra
		- Quintessential definition of a derivative
	- (4) Rate of change of a function (How fast is the function changing?)
		- If function changes slowly, derivative is small. If function changes quickly, derivative is large
		- How fast a function is changing
	- (5) How fast is the dependent variable changing when the independent variable changes
		- y is dependent variable
		- x is independent variable
			- If it changes a little bit and the dependent variable changes a lot, we have a large derivative
		- Derivative tells us how fast dependent variable is changing when making a change to the independent variable
	- (6) A function describing the change (slope) of a function of the independent variable
	- (7) Notation (There are many different ways to write down a derivative)
		- $\frac {dy}{dx}$ 
		- $\frac {dx}{dt}$
		- $y'$
		- $\dot x$
