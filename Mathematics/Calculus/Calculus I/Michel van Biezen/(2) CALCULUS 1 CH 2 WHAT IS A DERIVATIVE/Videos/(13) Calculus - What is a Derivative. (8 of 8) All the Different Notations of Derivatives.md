	- Derivative of y "with respect to " x = $\frac {d}{dx}(y)$
		- Typically y is the dependent variable and "with respect to" x becomes the independent variable. As x changes, y changes 
	- D' also means first derivative
	- $\dot y$ means derivative of y with respect to "t" when t stands for time
		- $\frac {dy}{dt}$
		- Means the function of y should be always a function of time t
	- $\ddot y$ means second derivative of time
	- $dy = (2x + 4)dx$
		- This is now called differentials
			- dy is a [[Differential|differential]]
			- dx is a differential
		- The differentials represents a minuscule very tiny change in x and a very tiny change in y. In the limit when the $\Delta x$ goes to 0, these are very tiny minute changes
		- If we can plug-in a very small change for x when x has a certain value, we can figure out how fast y is changing 
			- If x = 2
			- x changes from 2 to 2.1 (given dx = 0.1)
				- Then y will change 0.8
