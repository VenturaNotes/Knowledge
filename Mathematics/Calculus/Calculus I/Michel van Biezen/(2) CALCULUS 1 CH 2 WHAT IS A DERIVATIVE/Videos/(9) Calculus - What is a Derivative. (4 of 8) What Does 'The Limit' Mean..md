	- Derivative is equivalent to the slope of a function. It means how fast the dependent variable is changing with respect to the independent variable
	- Slope of tangent line is exactly equal to slope of function at that particular point
	- $\frac {dy}{dx}$
		- [[Derivative]] of y with respect to x
	- For $\frac {dy}{dx} = 2x-4$
		- When x becomes larger than 2, then the slope is positive
		- When x is less than 2, then the slope is negative
