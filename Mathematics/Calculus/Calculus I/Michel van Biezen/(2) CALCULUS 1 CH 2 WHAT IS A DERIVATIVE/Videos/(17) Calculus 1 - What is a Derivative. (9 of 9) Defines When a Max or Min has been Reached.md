	- The slope of the max and min represents a horizontal line since the tangent would be a horizontal line
		- Slope must equal 0
	- Since slope = derivative, the derivative = 0
	- To find max or min
		- set y' = 0
			- To check if it's min or max, plug-in a value to the left of the point found. If the slope there is positive, you have a maximum value. If you have a negative, you have a minimum value
