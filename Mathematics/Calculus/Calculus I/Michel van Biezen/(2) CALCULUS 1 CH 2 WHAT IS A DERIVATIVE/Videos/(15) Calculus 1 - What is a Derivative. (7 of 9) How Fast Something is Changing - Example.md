	- Want to find how fast V is changing as a function of h
		- We have a container in the shape of a cone. It's filled up with water up to a certain height "h". The radius at that point is equal to "r" and the volume of the amount of water we have is equal to $V = \frac {1}{3}(\pi R^2)h$
		- The relationship between height and radius is that the $R = \frac 12h$
		- When you get a question about how fast something is "changing", think about derivatives
	- dv means the change in volume
	- dh means the change in height
	- When "dh" is negative "dv" is negative
	- Let's say that the height is equal to 10 meters and that the change in height is equal to 0.1 meters. What would be the change in volume when the height changes $\frac {1}{10}$ of a meter when the height was already 10 meters.
		- It's saying that the volume would change by $7.5m^3$
	- When you separate the two terms of a derivative by themselves, they're called differentials
		- "dv" and "dh" in this case
