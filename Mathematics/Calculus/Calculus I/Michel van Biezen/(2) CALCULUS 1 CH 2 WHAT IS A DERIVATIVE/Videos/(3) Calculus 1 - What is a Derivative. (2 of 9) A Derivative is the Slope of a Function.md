	- Derivative is slope of a function
	- [[Secant Line]]
	- [[Tangent Line]]
		- Slope of tangent line is equal to slope of function at point $P$
	- Slope of secant line is almost equal to the slope of a tangent line
		- Keep moving point Q closer to point P
	- Derivative of a function and slope of a function are the same thing
	- The derivative is the slope of a function which is often a function in itself
		- All we have to do is plug-in a value for the variable and tells us what the slope is at that particular point on the function
			- Such as Derivative = 2x
				- 2(1) = 2 means slope is 2 at x-coordinate: 1
