	- Errata
		- $P(x=10) = -0.01(10)^2 + 2(10) - 10 = 11$
		- $\frac {dP}{dx} = -0.02x + 2$
	- How fast is a function changing
		- P = profit (In $1000 units)
		- X = quantity produced
	- The derivative represents how fast your profit is changing as you're making more and more units
		- So if you make one more unit, how fast is your profit changing?
	- The derivative of a constant is 0
	- If producing 10 units, the profit will go up by 1.8 (-0.02(10) + 2 = 1.8)
		- P(x=10) actually equals 9
			- So you'd expect P(x=11) to be 9 + 1.8 = 10.8
				- However, the true value is 10.79 probably because the rate changes over time. The rate is only 2.2 at that specific point but probably different at another point.
