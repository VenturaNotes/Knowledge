	- Derivative tells us how fast the dependent variable is changing when the independent variable changes
	- Independent variable (time)
	- Dependent variable (position)
	- Change of position over change of time is known as [[velocity]]
		- Slope of line tells us how fast the object is moving
	- The derivative is simply the rate of change of position as a function of change in time
	- When slope = "derivative" = $\frac {\Delta v}{\Delta t}$ = a (acceleration)
	- Derivatives simply tell us how fast something is changing
	- For v(t) = 2t+5
		- Derivative of that simplify represents how fast the volume(?) is changing as a function of time.
