	- $x = x_0 + v_0t + \frac 12 a t^2$ 
		- Distance traveled = initial position when time = 0 + when velocity = 0 $*$ time + 
		- $v_0$ is what the velocity is equal to when time = 0 
		- Second order equation
		- In this case, distance with respect to time
	- The first derivative with respect to time
		- = the rate of change of x with respect to t
		- = slope of the function x
	- First derivative in this case gives [[velocity]]
		- The velocity is equal to the slope of that function
		- by definition, the slope is the first derivative
		- This is when velocity is a function of time
	- The second derivative with respect to time (this is the derivative of the derivative)
		- = The rate of change of $v$
		- = The rate of change of the first derivative
	- [[acceleration]]
		- The change of velocity with respect to time is acceleration
	- $\frac {d^2x}{dt^2}$ 
		- The 2s are not exponents. That's just the way to write the second derivative of x with respect to time
	- First derivative gives [[velocity]]
	- Second derivative gives [[acceleration]]
