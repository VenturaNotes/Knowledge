	- f(t) = x
		- This is a function of the variable t which is called x
		- t is an independent variable
	- f(t) is the function
	- x(t) would just be called x?
	- The first derivative with respect to t:
		- $\frac{df}{dt}$ is the derivative of the function with respect to time
	- 2nd Derivative with respect to t
	- 3rd Derivative with respect to t
		- Not many real world applications
	- 4th Derivative with respect to t
		- Not many real world applications
	- 5th Derivative with respect to t
		- Not many real world applications
