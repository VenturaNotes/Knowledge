	- (1) Find derivative
	- Found 4 [[critical points]]
	- Concavity
	- How to evaluate all the critical points
		- (1) Find the first derivative
		- (2) Set the first derivative equal to 0 to find the max and mins and the horizontal inflection points
		- (3) Find y-values of points found so they can be plotted on graph
		- (4) Find second derivative of function
		- (5) Set second derivative equal to 0 to find inflection points
			- If inflection points different from points found in step 2, then we don't have horizontal inflection points, we have vertical inflection points. It also guarantees that the points found in step 2 are max and mins then
		- (6) Find corresponding y-values to plot those points on graph
		- (7) Check for concavity by evaluating particular values for x in the second derivative to see if the concavity is concave up or down
		- (8) Then evaluate slope which means the first derivative for various values of x to see if the slope is positive or negative
