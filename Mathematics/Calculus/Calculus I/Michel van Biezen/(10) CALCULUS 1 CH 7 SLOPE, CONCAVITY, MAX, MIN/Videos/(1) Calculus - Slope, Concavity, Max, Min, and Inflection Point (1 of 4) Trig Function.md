	- [[Slope]]: Steepness of a function at particular places
		- Simply the derivative of a function
		- Positive and negative
	- [[Concavity]]
		- How the slope changes
		- [[Concave down]]
		- [[Concave up]]
	- Points on graph where slope is 0
		- Can be [[local maximum]]
		- Can be a [[minimum]] point on graph
	- [[Inflection point]] (different types of inflections points)
		- Where slope is decreasing and then slope increases again
			- Slope is zero in this example
			- [[Horizontal point of inflection]]
		- Where it changes between concave down and concave up
			- Slope not zero in this example
			- [[Vertical inflection point]]
