	- [[Differential|differentials]]
		- Handy technique to use when finding how things are changing relative to each other
	- Given a square, how much will the area change if the sides change by 1%?
	- $\frac{da}{dx}$ = Derivative of A with respect to x
		- How fast is A changing as x changes
		- Make a change in x and you have a corresponding change in A
	- "da" and "dx" are known as [[Differential|differentials]]
		- If x changes by a small amount "dx", then A will change by a small amount "dA"
		- Relationship will be determined by the "2x" in this case
