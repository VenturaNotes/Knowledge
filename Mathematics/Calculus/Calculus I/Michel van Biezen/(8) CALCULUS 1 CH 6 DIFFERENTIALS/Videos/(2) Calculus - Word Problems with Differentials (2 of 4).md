	- A cube 1 inch on each side is to be painted by paint 0.01 inch thick. Use [[Differential|differentials]] to determine the volume of the paint
	- $\frac {dV}{dx} = 3x^2$
		- This is when the equation is set as a [[derivative]]
	- $dV = 3x^2dx$
		- For a given value of x, if we change the "x" by a little bit, we can calculate how much the volume changes
