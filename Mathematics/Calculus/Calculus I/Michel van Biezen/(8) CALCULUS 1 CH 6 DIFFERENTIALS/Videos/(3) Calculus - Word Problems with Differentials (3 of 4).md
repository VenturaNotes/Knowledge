	- A sphere is constructed with a radius of 1 foot. How much of an error can be made in the radius, such that the volume will not change by more than 3%
	- Volume of [[sphere]]
		- $V = \frac 43 \pi R^3$ 
	- "dV" and "dR" are differentials
		- "dV" stands for small change in volume
		- "dR" stands for small change in R
