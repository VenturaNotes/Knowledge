	- Cut the strongest beam from a log that has a diameter of 20''
		- Beam strength depends on width and height
		- S = strength of beam
			- S is proportional to width
				- If you double the width of a beam, you get twice the strength. Only linearly proportional to the width
		- Strength of beam is proportional to height squared (that's why we like to make beams higher than wide.)
			- By doubling the height of the beam, you quadruple the strength of the beam
			- Advantage is to make the beam higher than wider (to get more strength)
	- Equation is $S = kwh^2$ where k is the constant
