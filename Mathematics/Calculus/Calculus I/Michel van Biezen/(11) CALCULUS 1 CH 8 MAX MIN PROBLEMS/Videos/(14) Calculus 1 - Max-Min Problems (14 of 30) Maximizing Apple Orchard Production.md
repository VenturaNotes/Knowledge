	- When there are 28 trees per acre each tree yields 400kg of apples. For each tree added per acre, the yield of each tree drops by 10kg. How many trees should be planted per acre to maximize the yield?
		- Don't need to write an equation for a constraint if you are already working with one variable
			- $y = (28 + x)(400 - 10x)$
