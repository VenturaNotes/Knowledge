	- What is the largest rectangular area that can be enclosed by 100 feet of fencing? (can you get a larger area with a circular fence?)
		- Square is largest rectangle we can have for specific perimeter. Gives largest area
		- If you can have a circle, this gives a larger area than the square
	- Steps
		- (1) Find out what is being maximized
		- (2) Find an equation with the given variables for what you're trying to maximize
		- (3) Use constraint to eliminate all by one variable
		- (4) Take derivative of equation
		- (5) Set derivative equal to 0
		- (6) Solve for variable
			- Then use constraint to solve for other variables
		- This is the general way you solve max-min problems
