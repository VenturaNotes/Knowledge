	- Maximize the volume of an open box
		- (1) Determine what we're trying to maximize
		- (2) Coming up with an equation
		- (3) Coming up with constraints that allows us to simplify the equation so we only have one independent variable in the equation
		- (4) Derivative
		- (5) Set V' = 0
			- When you have max or min of any particular item, the slope will be 0
		- (6) Solve for x
