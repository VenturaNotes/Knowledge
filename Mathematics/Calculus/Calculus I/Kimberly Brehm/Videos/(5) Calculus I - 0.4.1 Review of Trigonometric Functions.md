	- Angles in [[Radian|Radians]] and [[Degrees]]
		- When we think about measuring angles, it is most helpful if they are in [[standard position]], where the initial ray coincides with the positive x-axis with the vertex on the origin. We then measure the angle in the counter-clockwise direction.
	- 405$\degree$ is a [[coterminal angle]] to 45$\degree$ 
	- 360$\degree$ = 2$\pi$

	- Trig functions ([[Unit Circle]])
		- 2 ways to think of trigonometric functions
			- One is unit circle and the other is using a right triangle
		- Just need to memorize values of the first quadrant
		- Each ordered pair gives $cos\theta$ and $sin\theta$ in (x, y) respectively
		- Inverse of sin, cos, and tan shown
		- "r" means radius of circle
			- r in unit circle = 1
		- When finding tan$\theta$ 
			- Just need to reduce fractions most of the time

	- Trigonometric functions - [[Right Triangle]]
		- Another way to think about the trigonometric functions is using right triangles
