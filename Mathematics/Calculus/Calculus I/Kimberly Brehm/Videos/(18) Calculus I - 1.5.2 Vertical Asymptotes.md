	- The What and where of vertical [[asymptotes]]
		- What: A vertical asymptote occurs when f(x) approaches $\infty$ or -$\infty$ as x approaches c from the right or left
	- Where:
		- Trigonometric Functions
			- $secx$ and $tanx$ 
			- $cscx$ and $cotx$ 
	- Rational Functions
		- When our denominator equals zero, but numerator does not (non-removable disc.)
