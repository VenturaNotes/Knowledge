	- The behavior of Functions
		- The study of calculus often asks us to determine the behavior of a function at different points. Does the function have a minimum or maximum? At what point is the function increasing or decreasing?
		- Your study of derivatives in the previous chapter will come into play when finding these minimum or maximum values, known as extrema, and therefore the behavior of the function nearby those extrema.
		- We will learn the process in our next video. Now, we want to understand everything we can about the terminology associated with extrema

	- [[Absolute Extrema]] or Global Extrema
		- f(c) is the absolute minimum of f on an interval $[a,b]$ when f(c) $\le$ f(x) $\forall$x $\in$ $[a,b]$
			- y-value, closed interval, for all
		- f(c) is the absolute maximum of f on an interval $[a,b]$ when f(c) $\ge$ f(x) $\forall$x $\in$ $[a,b]$
		- [[The Extreme Value Theorem]]: If f is <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">continuous</mark> on a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">closed</mark> interval $[a,b]$, then f has both a minimum and a maximum on the interval
	- The absolute minimum is the y-value

	- [[Relative Extrema]] or Local Extrema
		- f(c) is a relative minimum of f if there exists an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">open interval</mark> containing c on which f(c) is a minimum
		- f(c) is a relative maximum of f if there exists an <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">open interval </mark>containing c on which f(c) is a maximum

	- An Observation
		- Notice that on an open interval, a min or max can only occur on a hill or valley. What would the tangent line look like at that point? What is the slope of that tangent line? 
		- Notice that on a closed interval, a minimum or maximum can also occur at an endpoint.
