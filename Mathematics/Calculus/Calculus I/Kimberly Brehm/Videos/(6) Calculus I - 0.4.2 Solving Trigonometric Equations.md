	- [[Trigonometric Identities]]
		- Page 33 of your text contains all trigonometric identities you would have learned in Trig/Pre-Calculus. I've included only the identities that are used often in Calculus
			- [[Pythagorean Identities]]
			- [[Reciprocal Identities]]
				- $csc \theta = \frac {1}{sin\theta}$
			- [[Double-Angle Formulas]] ^88eff0
				- $sin2\theta = 2sin \theta cos \theta$ 
				- $cos 2\theta = cos^2 \theta - sin^2 \theta$ 
				- $tan2 \theta = \frac {2 tan \theta}{1 - tan^2 \theta}$
			- [[Power-Reducing Formulas]] (don't use these too much) ^c9a988
				- $sin^2 \theta = \frac {1 - cos 2 \theta}{2}$
				- $cos^2 \theta = \frac {1 + cos 2 \theta}{2}$
				- $tan^2 \theta = \frac {1 - cos2 \theta}{1 + cos 2 \theta}$
		- Apparently more identities on page 33?

	- Solving a [[Trigonometric Equation]]
		- To solve a trigonometric equation, we want to find all values for which the equation is true. For that reason, most often our result will include +2$\pi$n, n $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, unless the domain is explicit. Solve the following equation.

	- Since the domain is stated explicitly, we don't need to do "+2$\pi$n"
