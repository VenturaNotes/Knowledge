	- The [[Slope of a Line]]
		- To measure the slope of a line is to measure how steep the line is. We measure this based on the number of units of vertical change vs. the number of units of horizontal change. We denote this as:
		- Let's practice by graphing the following equations.

	- Using [[Point-Slope Form]]
		- We are often asked to write the equation of a line given two points or a point and a slope. Many students revert to slope-intercept form for determining the slope of the line, which works just fine. However, using point-slope form tends to be much easier.
		- Write the equation of the line passing through the points
		- $y-y1 = m(x-x1)$

	- Slope as an average rate of change
		- Remember that a slope is simply a late of change of our function. This can be used for any real-life circumstances where some quantity is changing over time. For instance, in 2020, the metro Omaha population was 835,000. In 2022, the population was 851,000. What is the average rate of change?

	- [[Parallel Lines]] and [[Perpendicular Lines]]
		- Graph the equation. Then write the equations and graph the lines parallel and perpendicular to your original line through the point (6,2).
			- Parallel lines have the same slope
			- Perpendicular lines have a slope that's opposite and reciprocal
