	- The [[Mean Value Theorem]] (MVT)
		- Let f be continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the open interval $(a,b)$. Then there exists a number c in (a, b) such that $f'(c) = \frac {f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}$.
		- As you can see, this theorem is very similar to Rolle's Theorem. The difference is that Rolle's is used to prove a value where the derivative is zero. The Mean Value Theorem (MVT) tells us that there is a value where the derivative is equal to the slope of the secant line (connecting the endpoints of the interval).
		- The MVT contains 2 conditions that we must state are met and explain why.

	- Mean Value Theorem Practice
		- For $f(x) = x^2 - 3x$, verify the MVT can be used and find all values of c which satisfy the MVT on the interval $[1,4]$
			- Since f is a polynomial, it is both continuous + differentiable. So MVT applies.
				- At $x = \frac{5}{2}$, that is the point where we'll have the tangent line that has the same slope as the line created by the endpoints of the function.
