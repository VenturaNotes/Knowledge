	- A test
		- Plot two points that have the same y-value
		- Connect those points with a line that is continuous and differentiable (no jumps, breaks, holes, gaps, corners or vertical asymptotes)
		- Count the number of places between your two points where a horizontal tangent line would occur, then make a conjecture.

	- [[Rolle's Theorem]]
		- Let f be continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$ and differentiable on the open interval (a, b). If f(a) = f(b), then there is at least one number c in (a, b) such that $f'(c)=0.
		- Rolle's Theorem contains 3 conditions. In order to use Rolle's, we must state these conditions are met and explain why
		- Show that $f'(x) = 0$ at some point c on f(x) = $x^2 - 6x$ in the closed interval $[0,6]$
			- A polynomial function will always be differentiable and continuous
			- At some point between 0 and 6 in this problem, there will be a horizontal tangent line.

	- Rolle's Theorem Practice
		- For $f(x) = x^4 - 2x^2, find all the values of c in the interval (-2,2) such that $f'(c) = 0$

	- Rolle's Theorem Practice
		- Find the two x-intercepts of $f(x) = x^2 - 3x + 2$ and show that $f'(c) = 0$ at some point between the x-intercepts. Then find the value of c
