	-  An airplane is flying at an altitude of 6 miles on a path that will take it directly over a radar tracking station. If the distance from the radar station is decreasing at a rate of a 400mph when the distance is 10 miles, what is the speed of the airplane.
		- $\frac{dc}{dt}$ = -400mph because the description says "distance from the radar station"
			- $\frac {db}{dt}$ would equal -400mph if the description says "ground distance from the radar station"
		- Negative velocity means that it is getting closer to something as opposed to further away
			- Negative velocity tells us that the distance is getting smaller to a certain point.

	- A television camera at ground-level is filming the lift-off of a space shuttle that is rising vertically according to the position equation, S = $50t^2$ with t = the number of seconds since lift-off. The camera is 2000ft from the launch pad. Find the rate of change of the elevation of the camera at 10s after lift-off
