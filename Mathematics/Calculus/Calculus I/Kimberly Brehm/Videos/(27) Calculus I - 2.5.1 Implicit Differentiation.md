	- How to Use Implicit Differentiation
		- Keep in mind, you only need to use implicit differentiation when you are unable to write your function explicitly using y as a function of x
			- Differentiate both sides of the equation with respect to x
			- Collect all terms involving $\frac {dy}{dx}$ or $y'$ on one side of the equation, with all other terms to the opposite side of the equation
			- Factor $\frac {dy}{dx}$ or $y'$ from each term on that side of the equation
			- Solve for $\frac {dy}{dx}$ or $y'$

	- Practice
		- Differentiate with respect to x and find the slope of the tangent line at this point. Then find the equation of the tangent line at that point.
