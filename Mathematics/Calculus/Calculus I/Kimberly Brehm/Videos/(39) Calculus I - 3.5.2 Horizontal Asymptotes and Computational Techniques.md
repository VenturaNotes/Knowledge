	- Limits at Infinity and Horizontal Asymptotes
		- Previously, we learned that the statement $lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} f(x) = L$ means that for each $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists an M > 0 such that $|f(x) - L| < \varepsilon$ whenever x > M
		- This meant that there was a line $y = L$ such that all values of f(x) were within $\varepsilon$ units to either side of L.
		- Our line $y=L$ is called a horizontal asymptote. Obviously, we can have 0, 1, or 2 horizontal asymptotes. But how can we find them?

	- Asymptotes for Rational Functions
		- We will begin by looking at rational functions in the form $\frac {c}{x^r}$.
		- We can see from the sample graphs that as x gets infinitely large or small, the limit is zero. Therefore, the horizontal asymptote is at y=0
		- But does this make sense?

	- More Asymptotes for Rational Functions
		- Find the limit (and horizontal asymptote(s)) for f(x)
			- $\frac {-\infty}{\infty}$
				- Called an [[indeterminate form]]
		- To find the solution, use the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">divide out technique</mark> (divide by x)
			- The power of the x should be the greatest power there.

	- Asymptotes Practice
		- Find the horizontal asymptotes of each of the following functions
			- Question 1: If degree on bottom is greater, then we'll get y = 0 
			- Question 2: If degrees are the same, the leading coefficients are the solution
			- Question 3: If degree on top is greater, then we won't get a horizontal asymptote but a [[slant asymptote]]

	- Asymptotes for Trig Functions
		- Find the limits for the following trig functions utilizing the [[squeeze theorem]]
			- If you have a limit between 2 other limits and those 2 other limits happen to be the same, the one in the middle has to be the same as well.
