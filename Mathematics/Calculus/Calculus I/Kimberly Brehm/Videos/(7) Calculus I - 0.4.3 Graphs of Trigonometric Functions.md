	- Graphs of Trigonometric Functions
		- All trigonometric functions are called [[periodic functions]]. In technical terms, this means that f(x) = f(x + p) where p is the period. In laymen's terms, it just means that the graph of the function repeats itself every p units. For sine ,cosine, secant, and cosecant the period is 2$\pi$, while for tangent and cotangent the period is $\pi$

	- Amplitude and Period
		- The graphs of the 6 trigonometric functions can be altered by the amplitude (sine and cosine only) and the period
			- Given $y = asinbx$
				- "a" will affect the [[Amplitude]]
					- Only for sine and cosine
					- "a" tells us how high or low that function is going to go
						- If you have "-a", the graph would just flip over the x-axis
					- If "a" = 3, then the Amplitude is |a| meaning the highest point it reaches will be 3 and the lowest point it reaches is -3 as shown in the common form of the equation above
				- "b" affects the [[period]] of a function
					- Increasing b makes the period much smaller
					- Decreasing b makes the period much larger while b > 0
			- Given $y = asecbx$
				- When a = 3, the peak and valley happen at $\pm 3$
				- b would make the period larger or smaller
			- Given $y=atanbx$
				- "a" is not called the amplitude (effects curvature of the line)
					- Straightens out the line 
					- b changes the period
