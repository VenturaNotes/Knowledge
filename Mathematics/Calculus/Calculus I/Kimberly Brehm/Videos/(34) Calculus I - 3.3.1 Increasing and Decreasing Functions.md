	- Recall that a derivative is a function that gives us the slope of the line at any point along the function.
	- We also know that if a slope of a line is positive, the graph is pointing up as we travel along the line from left to right. If it is negative, the graph points down.
	- Putting these facts together, we can see that a derivative can tell us whether a function is increasing or decreasing. It can also tell us the x-value at which the behavior changes. More specifically:
		- Sign/Value of Derivative and Behavior of Function
			- $f'(x) < 0$ means f is decreasing
			- $f'(x) > 0$ means f is increasing
			- $f'(x) = 0$ means f is constant

	- Steps for [[Finding Increasing and Decreasing Intervals]]
	- Here are the steps we can follow for finding the intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing. 
		- (1) Check to see if <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">f</mark> is continuous on (a, b). 
		- (2) Locate the critical numbers of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">f</mark> in (a, b). 
			- f'(x) = 0 or f(x) is undefined
		- (3) Divide the domain (implied or explicit) into intervals divided by the critical numbers (and any values where <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">f</mark> is discontinuous). 
		- (4) Choose a test point within each interval to plug into <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">f'(x)</mark>. Use the sign to determine the value of the function.
