	- What is an [[Indeterminant Form Function]]
		- A function whose limit results in an indeterminant form when you attempt direct substitution will need a bit of "math magic"
		- Indeterminant form is one such as
		- Example

	- [[Dividing Out Technique]]
		- If f and g are functions that agree at all but one point, we can often find the limit of the function by dividing out common factors.

	- [[Rationalizing Technique]]
		- If your function contains a radical within a [[rational function]], you might find the rationalizing technique helpful. This requires us to multiply the numerator and denominator by the [[Conjugate|conjugate]] of the radical

	- Two [[Special Trig Limits]] (memorize!!)
		- $lim_{x \to 0} \frac {sinx}{x} = 1$
		- $lim_{x \to 0} \frac {1 - cosx}{x} = 0$
