	- Strategies
		- Every time
			- Factor out any constants
			- Assign u and rewrite your function in terms of u (or do this part in your head!)
	- For rational functions: If numerator is a constant, rewrite expression using negative exponents to avoid dealing with fractions.
	- For problems with multiple instances of a factor: Factor out any least powers
	- For rational solutions: Simplify the solution to be written as one fraction.
