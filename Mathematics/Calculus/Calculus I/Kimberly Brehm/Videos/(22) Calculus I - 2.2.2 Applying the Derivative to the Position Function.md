	-   The [[Position Function]]
		- The position function will give us the position (or height) of a free-falling object (neglecting air resistance) at time t. $$s(t) = -\frac{1}{2}gt^2 + v_0t + s_0 $$
		- g represents gravity. We will use g = 32ft/sec$^2$ or g = 9.8m/sec$^2$
		- $v_0$ represents the velocity at time t = 0, usually called initial velocity
		- $s_0$ represents the object's height at time t = 0, or starting height
		- If we find the derivative of the position function, we are finding the rate of change of the position of the object, aka speed, which we will call velocity $$s'(t) = v(t)$$

	- Using the Position Function - Feet
		- A coin is dropped from the top of a building that is 256 feet tall
			- (a) Determine the position and velocity functions
			- (b) Find the time required for the coin to reach the ground
			- (c) Find the velocity of the coin on impact
