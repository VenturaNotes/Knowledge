	- [[Horizontal Tangent Lines]]
		- In our last video, we observed that our minimum or maximum values on open intervals occurred only on a hill or valley. At those points, the tangent line would be horizontal. The slope of a horizontal tangent line is zero.
		- So, one way to find a min or max is to find the derivative of the function, which gives the rate of change or slope of the function, then set the derivative function equal to 0

	- When a derivative doesn't exist
		- It is also possible to have a minimum or maximum at a sharp corner.
		- At those points the function is not differentiable
		- We don't yet have a rule for finding the derivative of absolute value functions, so let's simply find the slope to the left and right of x = 0, keeping in mind that when one-sided limits differ, the derivative does not exist.

	- [[Critical Numbers]]
		- We have discovered that an extrema occurs either when the function has a horizontal tangent line or when the function is not differentiable. These x-values are called critical numbers.
		- Theorems:
			- Let f be defined at c. If f'(c) = 0 or if f is not differentiable at c, then c is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">critical number</mark> of f
				- Horizontal tangent line vs corner
			- If f has a relative minimum or relative maximum at x = c, then c is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">critical number</mark> of f

	- Find the Extrema
		- Find the extrema of f(x) on the closed interval
			- Don't need to check 4 and 2 because it is outside the interval we're analyzing
