	- What is a [[derivative function]]
		- The derivative function f'(x) of the function f(x) is a function that will give us the instantaneous rate of change of f(x), aka the slope of the tangent line, at any point x in the domain of f(x)
		- The good news is, we already know how to doo this (assuming you watched 2.1.1)
		- The derivative of f at x is $$f'(x) = lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x+\Delta x) - f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
		- Provided that the derivative exists at x (more on this later)
		- You may see the derivative written as $$f'(x), \frac{dy}{dx}, y', \frac{d}{dx}[f(x)]$$
			- $\frac {dy}{dx}$ 
				- Is read as the derivative of y with respect to x

	- Differentiability and Continuity
		- We already know that for a limit to exist at x = c, both sides of the limit and the function all need to be equal
	- In order for a function to be differentiable at f(c), both sides of the limit need to be equal
	- Non-examples
	- Sharp turn or corner is not differentiable
	- Also can't differentiate infinity
