	- [[The Sum and Difference Rules]]
		- #comment The above does not seem completely correct. The sum and difference rule should be
			- $\frac {d}{dx} [f(x) \pm g(x)] = f'(x) \pm g'(x)$
			- Even then it should probably be more consistent
				- $\frac {d}{dx} [f(x) \pm g(x)] = \frac{d}{dx}f(x) \pm \frac{d}{dx}g(x)$
