	- [[Differentiation Rules|Derivatives]] of Trigonometric Functions
		- We already learned the derivatives of sine and cosine, but let's review and add the other trig functions
		- Find the derivatives of the following functions

	- Higher-Order Derivatives
		- We are very familiar now with finding the derivative of functions. We also know that the derivative function will give us the rate of change of position for our function, known as slope
		- But what if we find the rate of change of the slope?
		- This results in the concavity of our original function. We won't get to that quite yet...
		- But let's look back at the position function. The derivative of the position function resulted in the velocity function (the rate of change of position). What if we took the rate of change of velocity? that gives us the acceleration function
			- position
			- Velocity
			- Acceleration

	- To the moon, Alice!
		- Because the moon has no atmosphere, a falling object on the moon encounters no air resistance. In 1971, astronaut David Scott demonstrated that a feather and a hammer fall at the same rate on the moon. The position function for each of these falling objects:
		- where s(t) is the height in meters and t is the time in seconds. What is the ratio of Earth's gravitational force (-9.8 m/s$^2$) to the moon's?

	- Graphs of a Function and Its Derivatives
		- The question below gives the graph of f(x), f'(x) and f''(x) for a function on the same coordinate plane. Identify each graph
