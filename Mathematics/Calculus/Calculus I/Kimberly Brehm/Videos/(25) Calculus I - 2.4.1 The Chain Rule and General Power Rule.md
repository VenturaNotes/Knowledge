	- Not the Chain Rule
		- Let's look at two functions. For each, we want to find the first derivative.

	- The [[Chain Rule]]
		- The chain rule gives us a quick and easy way to deal with composite functions
		- If y = f(u) is a differentiable function of u, and u = g(x) is a differentiable function of x, then y = f(g(x)) is a differentiable function of x and $\frac {d}{dx}[f(g(x))]$ = $f'(g(x))g'(x)$

	- Decomposing a Composition of Functions
		- Let's practice determining u and f(u)

	- The [[General Power Rule]]
		- Recall that we previously learned the Power Rule, which stated $\frac {d}{dx}[x^n] = nx^{n-1}$
		- Now that we know the Chain Rule, we can generalize the power rule for when "x" is now a function of x
		- If y = $[u(x)]^n$ where u is a differentiable function of x and n is a rational number, then $\frac {d}{dx}u^n = nu^{n-1}u'$.
		- Find $y'$ for $y = (7x^4 - 3x)^6$

	- Practice
		- Find the derivative of the functions.
