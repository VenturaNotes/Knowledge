	- [[Limits at Infinity]]
		- When we discuss limits at infinity, we are discussing the end behavior of our function. Once all the "fun" stuff happens in your graph, what happens as x gets infinitely large or infinitely small?
		- One option is that y approaches a specific value, or two specific values if we look at both -$\infty$ and $\infty$
		- The other option is that as x gets increasingly large or small, so does y. This is the case in all polynomials.

	- Definition of Finite Limits at Infinity
		- Let L be a real number
		- The statement {} means that for each $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists an $M > 0$ such that {} whenever $x > M$.
			- $\varepsilon$ is the distance between y and the value of our function
			- We should be used to the notion of $\epsilon$ being a neighborhood around something
				- [[Epsilon]]
		- The statement {} means that for each $\varepsilon > 0$ there exists an $N > 0$ such that {} whenever $x > N$

	- Definition of [[Infinite Limits at Infinity]]
		- Let f be a function defined on the interval (a, $\infty$)
		- The statement $lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}$ f(x) = $\infty$ means that for each positive number M, there exists a corresponding number N > 0 such that f(x) > M whenever x > N.
			- Saying as "x" gets bigger, "y" gets smaller
		- The statement $lim_{x \rightarrow \infty}$f(x) = -$\infty$ means that for each negative M, there exists a corresponding number N > 0 such that f(x) < M whenever x > N.
			- Saying as "x" get bigger, "y" gets smaller
