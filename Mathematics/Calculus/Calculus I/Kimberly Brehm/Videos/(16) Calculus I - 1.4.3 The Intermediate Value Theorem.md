	- Continuity and the IVT
		- The [[Intermediate Value Theorem]] tells us an important fact about continuous functions:
			- If f is continuous on the closed interval $[a,b]$, f(a) $\ne$ f(b) and k is any number between f(a) and f(b), then there is at least one number c such that f(c) = k where a < c < b.
		- Try this: Draw a line from point a to point b without crossing the x-axis
			- Must cross x-axis

	- Using the Intermediate Value Theorem
		- To use the IVT, you must ensure that the conditions are met
			- Verify the function continuous over a closed interval
			- Verify f(a) $\ne$ f(b)
			- Verify f(a) < k < f(b) or f(b) < k < f(a)
		- Example: Verify that IVT applies to the indicated interval, then find the value of c guaranteed by the theorem

	- Applying the IVT
		- The most useful application of the intermediate value theorem is that we can determine if a zero (root, solution) exists within a given interval
			- Verify the function continuous over a closed interval
			- Verify f(a) $\ne$ f(b) <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">and f(a) and f(b) have opposite signs</mark>
			- Verify f(a) < k < f(b) or f(b) < k < f(a)
	- Example: Use the IVT to show that $g(x) = x^3 + 2x - 1 has a zero in the interval $[0, 1].$

	- Practice Applying the IVT
		- Explain why the function has at least one zero in the given interval:
			- $g(x) = x^2 - 2 - cosx, [0, \pi]$
