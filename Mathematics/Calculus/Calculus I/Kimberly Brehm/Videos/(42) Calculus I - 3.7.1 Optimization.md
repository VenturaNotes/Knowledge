	- Steps for Optimizing Applied Problems
		- (1) Sketch a diagram of the problem, if you are able. Include any given quantities and variables for anything we need to determine. 
		- (2) write the PRIMARY equation, or the equation you wish to minimize or maximize (the optimization equation) 
		- (3) Write a secondary equation using values given in the problem. This secondary equation should have at least one common variable from your primary equation. 
		- (4) Isolate a variable in the secondary equation, then substitute the expression back into the primary equation. 
		- (5) Find the derivative of the "new" primary equation. 
		- (6) Use the first derivative test to determine the minimum or maximum.

	- Optimization Practice
		- Spend some time working on following 3 questions. We will go over these in the next video. If you cannot remember a formula, there are formulas in the back of your textbook for area, volume, surface are, etc.
			- (1) A container in the shape of a [[right circular cylinder]] with no top has a surface area of $3\pi ft^2$. What height h and base radius r will maximize the volume of the cylinder?
			- (2) A sheet of cardboard 3ft by 4ft will be made into a box by cutting equally-sized squares from each corner and folding up the four edges. What will be the dimensions of the box with the largest volume.
			- (3) A cylindrical can is to hold $20\pi m^3$. The material for the top and bottom costs $\$10/m^2$ and material for the side costs $\$8/m^2$. Find the radius r and height h of the most economical can.
