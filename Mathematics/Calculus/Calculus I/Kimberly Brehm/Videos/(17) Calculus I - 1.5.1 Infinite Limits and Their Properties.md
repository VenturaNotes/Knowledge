	- Limits at Infinity (They don't exist)
		- Let's look at the graph of the function f(x) = $\frac 1x$
	- Determine
	- Limit does not exist because it approaches different values from the left and right sides

	- Practice - Analytically
		- Determine the number c for each function not in the domain, then find the limit as x approaches c from the left and right.
