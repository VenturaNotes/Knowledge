	- Continuity of Common Functions
		- [[Polynomial Functions]]
			- Continuous from (-$\infty$, $\infty$)
		- [[Rational Functions]]
			- q(x) $\ne$ 0
			- If factor cancels, removable
			- If not, asymptote
		- [[Radical Functions]]
			- n is even, g(x) $\ge 0$
			- n is odd,  (-$\infty$, $\infty$)
		- [[Trigonometric Functions]]
			- $sinx$ and $cosx$
				-  (-$\infty$, $\infty$)
			- $secx$ and $tanx$
				- asymptote at $\frac {\pi}{2}$
			- $cscx$ and $cotx$
				- asymptote at $\pi$

	- [[Properties of Continuity]]
		- [[Scalar Multiple]]
			- You can say the continuity is the same
		- [[Sum or Difference]]
			- Look at continuity of functions by themselves
		- [[Product]]
			- Would take into account functions being continuous
		- [[Quotient]]
		- [[Composite Functions]]

	- Continuity Practice
		- Find any points of discontinuity and tell whether they are removable
		- Determine the interval(s) on which the function is continuous
		- Determine the value of a such that the function is continuous over its entire domain.
