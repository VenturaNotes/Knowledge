	- Relative Extrema and Concavity
		- We can see that we have a relative minimum at (1, -$\frac 12$}) and a relative maximum at (0,0).
		- Note that the maximum occurs at the top of a hill, or where the graph is concave down. So, if f'(c) = 0 (critical number) and f"(c) < 0 (concave down), then f(c) is a relative maximum.
		- The minimum occurs at the bottom of a valley, or where the graph is concave up. So, if f'(c) = 0 ([[Critical Numbers|critical number]]) and f''(c) > 0 (concave up), then f(c) is a relative minimum.
		- If f'(c) =0 and f"(c) =0, the test fails.
			- Then we would need to use the first derivative test

	- [[Second Derivative Test]] Practice
		- Find the relative extrema of $f(x) = -3x^5 + 5x^3$ using the Second Derivative Test
			- First, find the critical numbers
			- Then find the second derivative and plug in the critical values.

	- Summary of Extrema, Inc/Dec and Concavity
		- [[Critical Numbers]]
			- f'(x)
				- Set f'(x) = 0 and find where f'(x) is undefined
		- [[Relative Minimum]] or [[Relative Maximum]]
			- f(x)
				- Plug critical numbers into f(x) and the endpoints. These are possible relative min or max
			- f'(x)
				- First Derivative Test. Using intervals for incr./decr. If from +/- its a max or -/+ it's a min
			- f''(x)
				- Second Derivative Test. Plug critical #'s into 2nd derivative. 
					- f''(x) > 0 relative min.
					- f''(x) < 0 relative max
		- [[Increasing]] or [[Decreasing]]
			- f'(x)
				- Split domain into intervals using critical numbers
				- f'(x) > 0 increase
				- f'(x) < 0 decrease
				- f'(x) = 0 Constant
		- [[Points of Inflection]]
			- f(x)
				- Plug values where f''(x) = 0 or is undefined in for f(x). Those are possible inflection points
			- f''(x)
				- Set f''(x) = 0 and find where f''(x) is undefined. Create intervals to determine if concavity changes. If it does, they are points of inflection
		- [[Concave Up]] or [[Concave Down]]
			- f''(x)
				- Set f''(x) = 0 or find where f''(x) is undefined. Set up intervals to check concavity.
					- If f''(x) > 0, concave up.
					- If f''(x) < 0 concave down
