	- Limits of trig Functions
		- All limits of trigonometric functions are found using direct substitution. However, the value of c must be in the domain of the function.
	- At intervals of $\frac {\pi}{2}$ for [[tangent]] and [[secant]] is where the function will be undefined
	- At intervals of $\pi$ for [[cotangent]] and [[cosecant]] is where the function will be undefined
