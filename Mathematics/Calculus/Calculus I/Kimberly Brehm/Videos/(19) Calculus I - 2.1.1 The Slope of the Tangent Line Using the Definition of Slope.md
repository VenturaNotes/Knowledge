	- The slope of a tangent line using a table
		- Find the slope of the line tangent to the function f(x) = $x^2 - 2x + 1$ at the point (2,1)
		- Start by finding the slope of the secant line through (2, 1) and (3, f(3))
		- We then repeat this process for values closer and closer to the x-value of 2. The slope we find for the secant line for x-values closest to 2 will be a great approximation to the slope of the tangent line at (2, 1)

	- Definition of a tangent line with slope m
		- Let's approach this in a "mathy" way
		- Slope formula
		- Note some texts replace $\Delta x$ with h
			- Change in x
	- Now bring in the calculus....

	- Using the definition at one point
		- Use the definition of slope to find the slope of the line tangent to f(x) = 2x - 3 at (3, 3)

	- Using the definition for multiple points
		- Use the definition of slope to find the slope of the line tangent to f(x) = $x^2 - 1$ at x = 0, 1 and 2.

	- Practice
		- Use the definition of slope to find the slope of the line tangent to $f(x) = 2x^2 - 5$ at x = 2 and 3
