	- [[Continuity]] at a point
		- A function that is continuous at x=c means that there is no interruption in the graph of f at c. There are 3 conditions for which the graph of f(x) is discontinuous at x = c.
			- f(c) is undefined
			- $lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) = DNE$
			- $lim_{x \rightarrow c}f(x) \ne f(c)$
		- for a function to be continuous at x = c, then:
			- $f(c)$ is defined
			- $lim_{x \rightarrow c} f(x)$ exists
			- $lim_{x\rightarrow c}f(x) = f(c)$

	- Continuity on an [[Open Interval]] or [[Closed Interval]]
		- A function is continuous on an open interval (a, b) when the function is continuous at each point in the interval
		- A function that is continuous on the entire number line ($-\infty, \infty$) is everywhere continuous.
		- For a function to be continuous on a closed interval $[a,b]$, the function must
			- Be continuous on the open interval (a, b)
			- $lim_{x \rightarrow a^+} f(x) = f(a)$
			- $lim_{x \rightarrow b^-} f(x) = f(b)$

	- Removable and Nonremovable [[Discontinuities]]
		- Discontinuities fall into two categories: removable and nonremovable. A discontinuity at c is called removable when f can be made continuous by appropriately defining (or redifining) f(c).
			- Removable
				- Hole
			- Nonremovable
				- Gap
				- Asymptote

	- Continuity Practice - Analytically
		- Determine if each function is everywhere continuous. If the function is discontinuous, find any points of discontinuity and tell whether those points are removable or non-removable

	- Discuss the Continuity: Steps
		- We are often asked to "discuss continuity". Here is what you are being asked to do:
			- (1) Determine the domain of your function. This will give you an open, closed, or mixed interval
			- (2) Determine any points of discontinuity of the function(s)
			- (3) If either endpoint of your interval is closed, ensure that:
				- For a left endpoint, 
				- For a right endpoint,
