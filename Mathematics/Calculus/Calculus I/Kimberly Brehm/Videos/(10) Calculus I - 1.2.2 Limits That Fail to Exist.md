	- Different [[Right Side Limits]] and [[Left Side Limits]]
		- Let's first talk about one-sided limit notation. If we want to find the limit from just the left side of c, we write {limit}. For just the right side of c, we write {limit}
		- One way a limit fails to exist is when lift limit $\ne$ right limit. So, we would write limit of c = DNE (Does not exist)
		- Example (First way that a limit would fail to exist)
			- In $y=\frac {|x|}{x}$, we see that the [[left-hand limit]] is equal to "-1" while the [[right-hand limit]] is equal to 1

	- [[Unbounded Behavior]]
		- f(x) increases or decreases without bound as x approaches c
			- Show that {limit} = DNE
				- Might say later on that the limit is infinity for $lim_{x \rightarrow 0} \frac {1}{x^2}$

	- [[Oscillating Functions]]
		- f(x) oscillates between two values as x approaches c

	- Practice: Evaluate the following
		- For f(0), you can't write "DNE". You'd need to write "undefined"
