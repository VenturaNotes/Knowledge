	- Relative Extrema and Inc/Dec Intervals
		- After you have determined the intervals on which a function is increasing or decreasing, it is not difficult to locate the [[relative extrema]] of the function.
		- The function f(x) has a relative maximum at the point (0, 0) because f is increasing immediately to the left of x =0 and decreasing immediately to the right of x = 0.
		- In addition, the function has a relative minimum at (1,-0.5) because f is decreasing immediately to the left of x = 1 and increasing immediately to the right of x= 1.

	- The [[First Derivative Test]]
		- Let c be a critical number of a function <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">f</mark> that is continuous on an open interval <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">I</mark> containing <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">c</mark>. If <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">f</mark> is differentiable on the interval, except possibly at c, then f(c) has the following attribute:
			• If f'(x) changes from negative to positive at c, then f has a relative minimum at (c, f(c)).
			• If f'(x) changes from positive to negative at c, then f has a relative maximum at (c, f (c)).
			• If f'(x) has the same sign on both sides of a, then f(c) is neither a relative minimum nor a relative maximum.

	- The First Derivative Test Practice
		- Find the relative extrema of the function f(x) = $(x^2-4)^{\frac 23}$

	- The First Derivative Test Practice
		- Find the relative extrema of the function g(x)
	- Would be neither at x=0 even if signs changed because our function is not defined at that point.
