	- (1) The $\varepsilon \delta$ definition
	- (2) example w/ actual numbers & a picture
	- (3 four key words for writing a good proof
- $\delta$ is supposed to be a small number
	- Then the corresponding value of our function $\sqrt{2x+1}$ must be very close to our limit $3$
		- This must be very close to our limit meaning $\varepsilon$ distance close
- $\varepsilon$ is the distance between the function and the limit
- When finding $\delta$
