	- The derivative of each of these functions
	- [[Power rule]]
	- Will here the functions called [[linear combination|linear combinations]]
		- This is because we have a constant coefficient out in front of a function in terms of x
		- Will have a constant coefficient in front of a power function $x^h$ 
	- The derivative of a constant is always 0
	- $5x^4 - 6x + 90x^{100}$ is a combination?
	- The derivative of the combination is the sum of all the derivatives of each of the individual terms
