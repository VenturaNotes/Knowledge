	- Use the definition of the [[derivative]] to find the derivative at (1, 3) of $y = 4x - x^2$ 
	- Reminder
		- Slope of the secant line / average rate of change/ [[difference quotient]]
			- $m = \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} = \frac{f(x_2)-f(x_1)}{x_2 - x_1}$
		- Slope of the tangent line / instantaneous rate of change / definition of the derivative
			- $f'(a) = m = lim_{x \to a}\frac{f(x) - f(a)}{x -a} = lim_{h \to 0}\frac{f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$ 
	- Can find equation of tangent line by doing $y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)$
		- This is the [[point-slope form]] of the equation of a line
