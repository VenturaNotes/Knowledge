	- How to find rate of change of a function at a point
	- The [[rate of change]] of a line is the slope of a line
		- Slope is 2 everywhere for y = 2x+2
	- Will find equation of line tangent to curve to find slope at point of curve
	- [[Tangent]] and [[secant]]
		- The line tangent to a curve is a line that barely skims the graph (intersecting at exactly one point)
		- The secant line runs through the graph at one or more points
	- Building the tangent from the secant
		- As I move the second point closer to the tangent point, the distance between the points of intersection become smaller and smaller
			- The secant and tangent lines become more and more similar
			- Eventually, the distance between the points will become infinitely small until eventually the two points come together at a single point and the line no longer intersects the function at two points, but only at one. This is the tangent line to the curve at that point
	- To calculate the rate of change of a function at a point, we need to find the slope of the tangent line. Therefore, the equation of the tangent line
		- Need 2 points or a point and a slope
	- [[Average rate of change]] equation
		- $\frac {f(b) - f(a)}{b-a}$
		- The instantaneous rate of change which is the slope of the tangent line which is the slope of the function at the tangent point
	- Definition of the derivative
		- The distance between the tangent point and secant point will be labeled "h"
	- Slope of tangent line
		- $f'(x) = lim_{h \to 0} \frac {f(x+h) - f(x)}{h}$ 
		- h becomes smaller and smaller until it eventually becomes 0. 
			- Instantaneous rate of change of the function at the tangent point

	- Errata
		- The Example is incorrect. Instead of the derivative being $f'(x) = 4x^2 - 4x + 1$, it should be $f'(x)\frac {1}{4x^2 - 4x + 1}$ 
	- An example
		- The instantaneous rate of change of the function at x = 1 is 1
