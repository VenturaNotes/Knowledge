## What to Expect
- Instantaneous rate of change

- Area under the curve (area between the graph of a function and the x axis)

## Functions vs Equations
| Equation   | Function        |
| ---------- | --------------- |
| $y=x^2 + 1$ | $f(x) = x^2 + 1$ |
| $(x,y)$      | $(x,f(x))$        |

## What are functions?
- A function is a special kind of equation that tells us about the unique relationship between two variables x and y.
- A function will give you one y for any x you put into it. 1 value in, 1 value out

## Function Machine
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 5.51.50 AM.png]]
- Input side and output side
- Machine itself is the equation that relates x and y.
- When putting an x-value into the input machine, it will calculate exactly 1 y-value and spit it out on the output side of the machine


## Graph of a Function
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 5.53.53 AM.png]]
- Can think of a function as being made up of its entire set of input/output pairs
- Each pair is 1 point on the graph of the function
- Graph is a picture of all the input/output pairs
	- Can help us predict and visualize the output that the function will return for any input


## Domain and Range
- Domain of a function is the set of all possible input 
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 5.55.28 AM.png]]
	- Some values can be impossible to input
	- Can't take the square root of a negative number
	- You can't input them into your function so they're not in the domain of your function
- Range of function is completely dependent on the domain. The range is made of all the values that you can get out of your function machine as a result of inputting all of the values in your domain.
- If your function is $x^2$ you can input any value you want without breaking laws of mathematics or your function machine.
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 5.58.12 AM.png]]
	- The domain would be the set of all real numbers
	- The range of the function would just be positive numbers. Squaring a function would only return positive real numbers

## What functions are not
- Any equation that can return multiple values per single input value
- Circles great example of non-function
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 6.00.07 AM.png]]
	- Picking any x value inside the circle, the equation of the circle would return 2 output values for the single input value. 
	- By definition, an equation can only be a function if it returns exactly output for every input value.
	- Therefore a circle will never be a function


## Vertical Line Test
- Great way to test for functions
- If you draw a perfectly vertical line anywhere in the domain of a function, it will cross the graph only once.
	- If more than once, then the points that the line intersects the graph represent multiple values for the single input value and therefore, the graph cannot represent the function

## Combinations
- A function itself can be comprised of multiple functions
- Polynomial function is a great example
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 6.05.08 AM.png]]
	- $f(x) = x^3 + 3x^2 + 3x + 1$ 
	- Entire thing represents a function but so do each of the 4 terms inside it.
	- If taken separately, each one would pass the vertical line test
	- This is what we call a combination of other functions

## Compositions
- One function is nested inside another function
