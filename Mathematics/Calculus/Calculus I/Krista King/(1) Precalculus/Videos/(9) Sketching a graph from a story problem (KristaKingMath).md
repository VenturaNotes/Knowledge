	- Asked to draw a graph that models what the temperature does as a function of time. 
	- How to sketch the graph of a story problem
		- Pick out the key pieces
		- Sketch a graph
	- Information given
		- Initial temp = room temp
		- stove on = increases gradually
			- = remains at boiling
		- Turned down = decreases quickly
			- = remains at simmer
				- She tells us that a simmer means slightly above room temperature
					- It seems however that simmering should mean to be just below boiling point [^1]
	- Can label different parts of graph
