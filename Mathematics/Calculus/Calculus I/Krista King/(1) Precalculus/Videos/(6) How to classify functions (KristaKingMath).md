	- When classifying functions
		- Must be as specific as possible with classification without forgetting to classify the entire function
	- Classify the following functions
		- [[Polynomial]] (could have a 9th degree polynomial if that's the largest exponent)
			- [[Quadratic]]
			- [[Cubic]]
		- [[Power]]
			- [[Root]] (only applies when base is simply x)
			- [[Reciprocal]]
		- [[Rational]] (ratio or fraction of two polynomials)
		- [[Algebraic]]: (Algebraic functions are those that take a polynomial and construct the function using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking square roots)
		- [[Transcendental]]
			- [[Trigonometric]] (tan(2x))
			- [[Inverse Trigonometric]]
			- [[Exponential]]
			- [[Logarithmic]] (Logarithmic function)
