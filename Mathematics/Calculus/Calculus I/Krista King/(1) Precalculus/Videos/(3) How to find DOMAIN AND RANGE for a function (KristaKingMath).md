	- Find the [[Domain (Math)|domain]] and [[range]] of the function
		- $f(x) = 10^{2x} + ln(21-3x)$ 
	- The domain of a function is all of the x values for which the function is defined. The range of a function is all the y values you can get back when you plug in x values from the domain.
		- For domain, staying in realm of real numbers. Looking for values of x where the function is not defined
			- Pay attention when you a have a function that contains a [[natural log]], [[square root]], or a [[fraction]]
				- [[Natural log]] is not defined when argument inside is less than or equal to 0
				- For square root, radical must be greater than or equal to 0 (cannot be negative)
				- Fraction undefined when denominator is equal to 0
	- We infer that the range will be $y > 0$ since $10^{2x}$ will only be positive and $10^{2x}$ is significantly larger than $ln(21-3x)$ when $ln(21-3x)$ is negative.
		- Seems like range is not entirely accurate

			- Wolfram states that the range is $\mathbb{R}$ [^2]
