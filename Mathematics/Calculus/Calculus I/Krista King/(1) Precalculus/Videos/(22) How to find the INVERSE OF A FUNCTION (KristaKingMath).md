	- Find the [[inverse function]] and sketch its graph
		- $f^{-1}(x)$ means the inverse of x
			- Inverse of a function is the reflection of that function over the line $y=x$
	- To find the inverse function, solve the equation for x and then switch the x and y variables.
		- Make sure to replace $f(x)$ with $y$
