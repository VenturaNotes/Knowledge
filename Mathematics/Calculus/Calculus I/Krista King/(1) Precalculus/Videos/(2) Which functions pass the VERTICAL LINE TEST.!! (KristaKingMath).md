- Say whether or not each graph represents a function
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 6.14.23 AM.png]]
- An equation is any expression with an equal sign
	- y=x
	- A function is always an equation. There is always an equal sign in a function
- f(x) = x
	- We say that f is a function of x to indicate that this is a special type of equation called a function
- A function is an equation such that there is only 1 output of y for every input value of x
	- If we graphed the function and chose any value of x, it's only possible to get back 1 unique result for y.
	- For an equation to be a function, it must be true for every value of x within the domain of the function. For every single value of x that we can pick
- If you can find a single x value that returns multiple y values, then the graph is not a function
- The vertical line test tests different values of x and look at which y values are returned to you. If there is a point where 2 y values are returned, then the graph is not a function
- A circle will never be a function
- Vertical line test
	- If you can draw any perfectly vertical line that intersects the graph at more than 1 point, then the single x value returns 2 different output values for y which means the graph does not pass the vertical line test and therefore the graph is not a function
	- Graph must pass vertical line test to be a function.
