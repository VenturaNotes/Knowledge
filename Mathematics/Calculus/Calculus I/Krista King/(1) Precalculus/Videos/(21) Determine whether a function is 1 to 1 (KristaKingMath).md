	- Determine whether a function is [[one-to-one]] (whether or not it passes the [[horizontal line test]])
		- Several methods
	- Determine whether these functions are 1-to-1
		- There can only be one x-output value for every y-input value
	- One trick to figure out if a function is 1-to-1
		- For $g(x) = \frac 1x$, a function is 1 to 1 if 
			- $g(a) = g(b)$ which means a = b. Show this somehow
			- In the problem $\frac 1a = \frac 1b$ and we can multiply both sides by $ab$ which would give $a = b$ which would show that the function is 1 to 1.
