	- The [[Unit Circle]]. Interested in:
		- coordinates
			- One way to remember them is
				- $(\frac {\sqrt{3}}{2}, \frac {1}{2}), (\frac{\sqrt {2}} {2}, \frac{\sqrt{2}} {2}), (\frac {1}{2}, \frac {\sqrt 3}{2})$
					- For the x-coordinates in the numerator, it's moving up the unit circle counting down 3, 2, 1.
					- For the y-coordinates in the numerator, it's counting up 1, 2, 3 as we're moving up the unit circle.
					- Square root all the numerators and all the denominators should be 2
			- They're represented by $(cos \theta, sin \theta)$
		- angles in radians
		- angles in degrees
	- Radius is equal to 1 unit
		- r = 1
	- Origin is (0, 0)
	- Positive angles in counterclockwise direction
		- Will have negative angles with parametric and polar curves in calculus
