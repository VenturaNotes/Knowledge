	- Find equation of a line in [[point-slope form]]
		- Identify components
		- Plug them into point-slope formula
		- Simplify equation
	- Equation of the line in point-slope form, given:
		- (1) 
			- slope and y-intercept
			- Slope and point
			- Horizontal line through point
			- Horizontal line through intercept
		- (2)
			- Two points
		- (3)
			- Point and parallel to
	- Slope Formula is
		- $y-y_1 = m(x-x_1)$
			- x is the slope
			- $(x_1,y_1)$ is the x and y coordinates of a single point on the line
		- m = $\frac{y_2 - y_1}{x_2-x_1}$
	- $y = -2x + 3$ represents [[slope-intercept form]]
	- Lines that are [[parallel]] have the same slope
