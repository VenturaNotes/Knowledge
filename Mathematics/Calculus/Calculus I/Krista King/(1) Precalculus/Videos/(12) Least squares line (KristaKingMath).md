	- [[least squares line]] (aka, line of least squares) or regression line
		- slope and y-intercept
		- plug them into slope-intercept formula in equation of line
		- Simplify to find equation
	- Equation of line in slope-intercept form
		- y = mx + b
			- m = slope of line
				- $\frac {n(\Sigma xy) - (\Sigma x)(\Sigma y)}{n(\Sigma x^2) - (\Sigma x)^2}$
			- b = y-intercept
				- $\frac {(\Sigma y) - m(\Sigma x)}{n}$
