	- How to find coordinate points, and the domain and range of a function just by looking at graph of function
		- Will look for points on the y-axis that correspond with points on the a-axis
		- Will look for x and y value
	- Find f(1) and f(5), and [[Domain (Math)|domain]] and [[range]]
		- Domain is all x values for which the function is defined
		- Range is the corresponding set of y-values that the function can obtain based on the domain we've already defined
