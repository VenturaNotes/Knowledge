	- Find the center and radius of the [[circle]]
		- $x^2 + 2x + y^2 = 4$
			- We know this is a circle equation because we have an $x^2$ term and a $y^2$ term
	- [[Complete the square]] with respect to x and y to get the equation into the form
		- $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$
	- r must always be a positive value
		- It's impossible to have a negative radius and for the circle to still exist
