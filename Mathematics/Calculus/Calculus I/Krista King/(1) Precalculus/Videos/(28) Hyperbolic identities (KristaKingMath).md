	- How to use [[Hyperbolic Identity|hyperbolic identities]] to simplify a [[hyperbolic function]]
		- Make substitutions for the values of hyperbolic functions
		- Simplify as much as possible
	- Proof that the hyperbolic function $cosh^2x - sinh^2x = 1$
		- Use the identities [[cosh]] x and [[sinh]] x
