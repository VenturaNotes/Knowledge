	- Using [[Intermediate Value Theorem|IVT]] to prove function has at least one real [[root]]
		- Will look at range of each term of function
		- And will draw conclusions where function is positive and negative
	- With $cos(x) = x^3$ can collect all terms to one side: $f(x) = x^3 - cos(x)$
	- If every part of function is continuous, then the entire function is [[continuous]]
