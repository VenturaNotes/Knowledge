	- Classify any discontinuities of the function, then, redefine the function at any removable discontinuities
	- [[Discontinuities|Discontinuity]] in a function
		- Point at which the function is undefined (hole, gap, break, jump, asymptote)
	- [[Removable discontinuity]] (also known as point discontinuity [^1])
		- Just a single point
		- By simplifying a function (factoring denominator and removing factor of x - 2 by reducing fraction, we were able to remove the continuity at x = 2 )
	- [[Rational function]]
		- Polynomials in both the numerator and denominator
		- Will only be undefined when denominator = 0
	- x = 2 is a removable discontinuity in this case
	- x = -2 is a [[non-removable discontinuity]] (discontinuity will be a vertical asymptote)
		- If you have a real number in the numerator and 0 in the denominator, it's a good indication that there is going to be a [[vertical asymptote]] in the function at that particular value of x
			- Original function and simplified function both indicate this
		- We call asymptotes [[essential discontinuities]] or [[infinite discontinuity|infinite discontinuities]]
			- Any kind of asymptote is an essential or infinite discontinuity
	- Whenever you have some value that gives you $\frac 00$ from your original function, it's a good indication that you have a point discontinuity at that value
	- Made a continuous function by making a piecewise function and setting $f(x) = \frac 14$ when x = 2.
