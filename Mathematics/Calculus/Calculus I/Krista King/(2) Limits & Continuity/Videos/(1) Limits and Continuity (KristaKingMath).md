	- Limits
		- [[function (math)|functions]] are a  special type of equation that models a one-to-one relationship between x and y
		- Will learn about [[limits]] and [[continuity]]
		- For $lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$, L is the limit of the function.
			- In the example $f(x) = x + 3$, if we plug-in numbers that are very close to 1, we'll get back numbers that are very close to 4. We express that limit as shown above
		- For the function $f(x) = \frac {(x-2)(x+2)}{x-2}$
			- We see that the function is [[discontinuous]] at x = 2, but the limit as x approaches 2 for this function equal to 4.

	- Solving for limits
		- To plug in the number we're approaching and finding the limit of the function is called [[substitution]] (also known as plug and chug)
			- Limit problems usually don't work that easily
				- Might end up with 0 over 0 causing [[undefined]]
				- 0 in denominator of function causing undefined
			- Will therefore need to use other techniques to solve for limit
	- [[Factoring]]
		- Factor numerator and denominator as much as possible (then cancel terms)
	- [[Common denominator]]
		- If you have a fraction and a non-fraction, try to find common denominator (then simplify as much as possible)
	- [[Conjugate]]
		- With a radical or square root sign, multiply by conjugate
	- Will have more methods later on

	- [[Infinite limits]]
		- Shortcuts for finding infinite limits (both positive and negative)
		- (1) N = D
			- If degree of numerator and denominator are equal to one another, use [[ratio of coefficients]] to find the limit
		- (2) N < D
			- If degree of numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, then the infinite limit will be zero. Regardless if it's negative or positive infinity
		- (3) N > D
			- If degree of numerator is greater than degree of denominator, infinite limit will be positive infinity if approaching positive infinity
				- Negative infinity if approaching negative infinity
	- [[Continuity]]
		- A [[function (math)|function]] is [[continuous]] if there are no [[holes]], [[breaks]], [[jumps]], or [[gaps]] of any kind in its graph
			- Function is continuous if you can draw the entire thing without picking up your pen or pencil off the page
			- If you need to lift the pencil, it's [[discontinuous]]
	- [[Discontinuities]]
		- Most common types
			- [[Point]]
				- Represent specific points on the graph of a function where the function is not continuous.
				- Example of what we call a [[removable discontinuity]]
					- Removable because we can write a simple equation that will define the function at the point of discontinuity, and this second equation will plug the hole in the graph
						- Since we can plug the hole, it makes the discontinuity removable 
			- [[Jump]]
				- These are non-removable discontinuities because you can't write a simple equation that fills in the gap
				- Breaks in the graph (imagine walking along the graph and you need to jump to the discontinuity in next section of the graph)
			- [[infinite discontinuity]]
				- Discontinuities in the graph that asymptotes ([[vertical asymptote]], [[horizontal asymptote]], or [[slant asymptote]])
				- Also non-removable because you can't write a simple function that can fill the gap and make the function continuous

	- Crazy graphs!
		- If the graph of a function approached positive infinity on one side of the asymptote and negative infinity on the other side of the asymptote, then the limit would be truly [[undefined]]
		- [[General limit]]
			- Only exists if the left and right hand limits are equal which will never be the case at a [[jump discontinuity]]
		- Value of function = 3 for #4 because that's the shaded point
	- By using limits and continuity, we'll start talking about [[derivative|derivatives]] and answer the first fundamental question of [[calculus]]: How to find the rate of change of a function at a specific point
