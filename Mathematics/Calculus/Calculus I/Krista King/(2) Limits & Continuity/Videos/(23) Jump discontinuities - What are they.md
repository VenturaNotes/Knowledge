	- [[Jump discontinuity]] (can be called step discontinuities or discontinuities of the first kind)
		- A big break in the graph (gap)
			- Not the same as an [[infinite discontinuity]] or [[essential discontinuities|essential discontinuity]]
				- This is a discontinuity created by a [[vertical asymptote]]
		- A single point or hole is a [[removable discontinuity|point discontinuity]]
		- Interested in the LHL, RHL, and value of function at each jump discontinuity
	- The limit of the function at a jump discontinuity will never exist
		- This is because the LHL and RHL will never equal
