	- How to use the graph of the function, and the precise definition of the [[limit]], to find [[delta]]
		- Will identify the side of limit that constrains the definition
		- Use that value of [[epsilon]], to find [[delta]]
	- [[Epsilon-Delta Limit Definition]]
		- if 0 < |x - a | < $\delta$ then |f(x) - L | < $\epsilon$ 
	- If you have to find delta, usually given epsilon and vice versa
		- The delta was found to be 1.44
			- You could not use the $2.4 = \sqrt{x}$ because the value of delta found from that would fall out of the 1.6 epsilon range of the function
