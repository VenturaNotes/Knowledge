	- Use [[squeeze theorem]] to evaluate the limit
		- This is also called sandwich theorem
		- Will try to squeeze the function we've been given in between two other functions whose limits we already know
		- This problem will be pretty easy since we have a [[trigonometric function]]as part of our larger function
			- Cosine function oscillates between -1 and 1
		- Found that the limit of original problem was 0 since the value was squeezed between two other functions.
