	- [[Limits]] of [[composite functions]]
		- How do you find the limit of composite functions?
	- How to represent the composite of f of g
		- $f(g(x)) = f \circ g$
	- Will find limit first algebraically and then graphically
	- Can transform $lim_{x \to 4} f(g(x))$ = $f(lim_{x \to 4} g(x))$ only if f is continuous at the value 4
	- Given $ln(xsinx)$, you can say
		- $f(x) = ln(x)$ which becomes your [[outside function]]
		- $g(x) = xsinx$ which becomes your [[inside function]]
	- [[limit laws]]
		- Can be used to manipulate limits
	- [[Rational function]]
		- Numerator and denominator are polynomials
	- [[Infinite limits]] (N = numerator, D = denominator)
		- Results for when $\lim_{x \to \infty}$ for a rational function
		- If N > D : $\infty$
		- N < D : 0
		- N = D : ratio

	- What to do if a limit DNE at any point of the problem
	- Once we figure out the inner limit doesn't exist, we can say the whole limit DNE and we're done with the problem
		- You can see the discontinuity graphically if you're approaching different values from either side
	- As soon as you get to the DNE value of an inner limit, you know that the limit of the entire composite DNE
