	- How to use [[limit laws]] along with graphs of 2 functions to solve limit problems
	- Steps
		- Identify laws
		- Apply them
		- Use information from graphs to solve each problems
	- [[Combination functions]]
	- [[Limit laws]]
		- (1) The limit of the sum of two functions is the same thing as the sum of the limit of each function individually
			- $\lim_{x \to -2} [f(x) + 5g(x)]$ = $lim_{x \to -2}\text{ } f(x) + lim_{x \to -2}\text{ }  {g(x)}$
		- (2) The limit of a constant times a function is the same thing as the constant times the limit of that function
			- $lim_{x \to -2} \textcolor{hotpink}{5}g(x)$ = $\textcolor{hotpink}{5}\lim _{x\to -2} g(x)$
		- (3) The limit of the product of two functions is the same thing as the product of the limit of the individual functions
			- $lim_{x \to 1} [f(x)g(x)]$ = $\lim_{x \to 1} f(x) lim_{x \to 1} g(x)$
		- (4) The limit of a quotient is the same thing as the quotient of limits
			- $\lim_{x \to 2} \frac {f(x)}{g(x)}$ = $\frac {lim_{x\to 2} f(x)}{lim_{x \to 2} g(x)}$
				- Since g(x) = 0 in the given example, we need to say that the limit DNE and that the quotient would be undefined
	- If you have a different left hand and right hand limit, the [[general limit]] [[Doesn't exist|does not exist]]
		- LHL is left hand limit
		- RHL is right hand limit
