	- [[Infinite limit]]
		- Will confirm function has a [[vertical asymptote]] at x value that the limit approaches
			- Then will evaluate function at values close to and on both sides of the vertical asymptote
	- When dealing with [[trigonometric identities]], always best to deal with [[sine]] or [[cosine]] (most familiar values on [[Unit Circle]])
	- Definition of [[general limit]]
		- Right and left hand limits both exist and they're equal to one another
	- If a function is approaching positive infinity, you can say $+\infty$ or DNE
		- Same can be said for negative infinity: $-\infty$
