	- Steps
		- Examine each part of the definition of a limit
		- Look for part of the definition that is not true for our function
	- Prove that the limit does not exist
	- Definition of a [[limit]] says that a limit exists if
		- LHL exists
		- RHL exists
		- LHL = RHL
	- [[Absolute value]]
		- Seems like we can simplify $\frac {|x|}{x} = \frac {x}{-x}$ given domain
		- Possible to simplify $\frac {|x|}{x} = \frac {x}{x}$ as well given domain
	- Proved that [[general limit]] DNE since LHL $\ne$ RHL
