	- Find the left and right-hand limits of the function
		- Different from general limit (can only exist when 3 conditions are met)
			- LHL exists
			- RHL exists
			- LHL = RHL
		- $\lim_{x \to 4^-}$ means approaching a limit from the negative side (known as [[left-hand limit]])
		- $\lim_{x \to 4^+}$ means approaching a limit from the positive side (known as [[right-hand limit]])
	- Easiest way to solve a limit is with [[substitution]] assuming the function is [[continuous]] at that point
