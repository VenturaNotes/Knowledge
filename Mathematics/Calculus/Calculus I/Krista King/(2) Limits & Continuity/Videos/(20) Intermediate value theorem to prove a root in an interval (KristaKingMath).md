	- [[Intermediate Value Theorem|IVT]]
		- Evaluate at all ends of interval
		- Then show graph of function crosses x-axis between the values
	- Use the IVT to show that f(x) has a root on the interval (1, 2)
	- By showing that $f(1) < 0 < f(2)$, it shows that there is a root of the function on the interval 1 to 2
	- Bottom graph is real depiction of function in problem
