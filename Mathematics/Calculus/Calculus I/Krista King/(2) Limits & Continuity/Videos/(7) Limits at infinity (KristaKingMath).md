	- Limits at infinity
		- [[Infinite limit]]
		- [[L'Hospital's Rule]]
			- Simplifies function
			- Evaluate the limit as x goes to infinity
	- A [[rational function]] is the quotient of two [[Polynomial|polynomials]]
	- We can use L'Hospital's Rule to simplify the rational function inside the square root 
		- Must put limit inside square root sign
			- [[Limit Property]]
				- $\lim_{x \to \infty} \sqrt {\frac {9x^6 - x}{x^6+2x^3+1}}$ = $\sqrt {\lim_{x \to \infty} \frac {9x^6 - x}{x^6+2x^3+1}}$ = 
			- This is a property of limits
				- When you have the limit of a function and it's raised to a power you can convert that to have the limit included 
	- [[L'Hospital's Rule]] tells us to take the derivative of the numerator and denominator and substitute the derivatives for the original functions
		- Will be using [[power rule]] for numerator in this example
	- When can use L'Hospital's Rule as many times as we want to continue trying to simplify the function
