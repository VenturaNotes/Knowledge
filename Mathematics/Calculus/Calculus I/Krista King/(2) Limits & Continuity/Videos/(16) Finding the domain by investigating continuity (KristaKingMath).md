	- [[Domain (Math)|domain]]
	- [[Continuity]]
	- Find the domain of the function
		- The domain of a function are all of the values of x for which the function is defined
		- It's defined everywhere it's continuous
	- When asked to find domain of a function, we're actually being asked to say where the function is continuous
	- [[Fraction]] is [[undefined]] whenever the denominator is equal to 0
	- Since we have a 3rd root, we can have a negative number in the square root
	- To translate domain into continuity
		- The function f(x) is continuous everywhere except at x = 1 because the function is not defined there 
			- Ended up having a vertical asymptote at x = 1
