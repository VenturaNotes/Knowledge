	- Understanding the [[intermediate value theorem]] (IVT)
		- Sometimes it can be helpful to prove that a function has a solution or a root on a specific range
		- Assumptions
			- IVT assumes you have some interval a to b that is a [[closed interval]]
			- f(x) is continuous on the interval
		- Tells us
			- We can pick any value k (in y = k), meaning some value between f(a) and f(b). This is when function is increasing
				- $f(a) \le k \le f(b)$
			- If function decreasing
				- $f(b) \le k \le f(a)$
			- $a \le c \le b$ 
			- As long as k is inside its interval, then c will be inside its interval
	- Can use IVT to prove that a function has a root or solution inside the interval
		- The function at some point inside the internal is equal to 0
			- Sometimes we don't know what a solution is going to be but we want to show a function has a solution inside the interval $[a, b]$ 
	- Summary
		- If we have a closed interval $[a, b]$ , and f(x) is continuous on that interval, as long as we can show that f(a) is negative and f(b) is positive, then the IVT guarantees there is some value c inside the interval $[a, b]$ where k = 0 (or the function is going to have a value of 0) and $\therefore$ guarantees there is some point the function crosses the x-axis and $\therefore$ has a solution or root at that point
