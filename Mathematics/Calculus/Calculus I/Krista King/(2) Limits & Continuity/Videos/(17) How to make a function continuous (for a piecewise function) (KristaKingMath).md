	- Find the value of "c" that makes the [[function]] [[continuous]]
		- [[piecewise function]]
			- same thing as piecewise-defined function [^1]
				- There are 2 pieces that define the function in a different interval
			- The break is happening at x = 0
		- In order for function to be [[continuous]], the definition of [[continuity]] tells us
			- LHL must exist
			- RHL must exist
			- LHL = RHL
	- Steps (this is how to find the value of "c" that makes the function continuous)
		- Solve for value of "c" that made function continuous
		- Reduce function so that both expressions are in terms of "x" only
		- Prove function is continuous by
			- LHL exists
			- RHL exists
			- LHL = RHL
				- Values of limits at [[break point]] at x = 0 are equal to one another
