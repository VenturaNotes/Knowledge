	- Q: How are rates of change related to each other?
	- (A) Related Rates
		- A related rate means two things are changing but they're changing in relationship to one another. One increases at a certain rate and it makes the other one increase or decrease at a certain rate
		- (1) A spherical balloon is filled with air at a rate of $3 in^3\sec$. How fast is the radius changing when the radius is 4in?
			- (a) Draw a picture with related formulas
			- (b) Take the derivative with respect to time
			- (c) plug in what we know
			- (d) Solve for the remaining rate
	- (2) A 7 ft ladder is sliding down a wall. The top is sliding down at a rate of 1.5 ft/sec. How fast is the bottom moving along the ground when the bottom is 6ft from the wall?
	- (3) A camera is 2000 ft from a rocket that fires vertically. When the rocket is 500ft in the air, its velocity is 400 ft/sec. What is the needed rate of change of the angle of the camera?

	- (4) Water is draining from a cone shaped funnel at a rate of $0.25 ft^3/sec$. The height of the funnel is 3ft and the radius at the top is 2 ft. At what rate is the height of the water changing when the height is 1ft?
		- Volume of [[cone]] = $\frac 13 \pi r^2h$ 
		- Since the triangles both have a right angle and share an angle are [[similar triangles]]. Therefore, their sides must be proportional
