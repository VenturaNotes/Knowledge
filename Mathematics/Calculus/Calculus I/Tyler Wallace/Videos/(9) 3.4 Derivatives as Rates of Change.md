	- Q: What are some applications of the derivative?
	- A) [[Position]] s(t), [[velocity]] v(t), [[acceleration]] a(t) (physics applications)
		- (1) Velocity is the derivative of position
			- acceleration is the derivative of velocity
		- (2) If acceleration is in the same direction as the velocity the object speed up. If they are in opposite directions, it slows down
		- (3) Examples
			- (a) The position of an object in t seconds is given by $s(t) = t^3 - 3t^2 - 45t + 7$. When is it speeding up and when is it slowing down?
		- When using calculator, input the velocity on "y=". Then do "2nd" and "table", then take an x that falls within each range of the number line. Just need to put in 0.5 to find the values of $v(t)$ and $a(t)$
		- When velocity and acceleration going in same direction
			- When both negative, speeding up backwards
			- When both positive, speeding up forwards
		- If velocity negative and acceleration positive, object is slowing down
	- (B) The position of an object in seconds (t) is given by $s(t)$. When is it speeding up and slowing down?
		- Specifically interested when both (v(t) and a(t)) are changing between positive and negative because that's where things are going to change
			- These changes happen at 0

	- (B) [[Revenue]], [[cost]], [[profit]], & Marginal Changes (business applications)
		- (1) [[Marginal change]] - the change for "one more"
			- If you make 1000 widgets, if you make one more widgets (1001), is it more or less profitable? more cost less cost? 
				- Helps determine if it's worth expanding or shrinking the business at this given time
			- A marginal change is a very small change
			- Estimate marginal change with derivative
		- (2) [[Cost]] C(x) & [[Marginal Cost]] MC(x) = C'(x)
			- [[Revenue]] R(x) = xp & [[Marginal Revenue]] MR(x) = R'(x)
				- p = price per item, often a function
					- Price will be dependent on various variables 
				- We usually have some price function that needs to be multiplied by the number of things that we sell
				- If price is $5 and we sell 7, then we've made $35 in revenue
				- Marginal cost can be estimated with the derivative of cost
				- Marginal revenue can be estimated with the derivative of revenue
			- [[Profit]] P(x) = R(x) - C(x) & [[Marginal Profit]] MP(x) = P'(x)
				- Marginal profit is derivative of profit at x
		- (3) Examples
			- (a) The cost to develop a product is C(x). What is the marginal cost of the 101st item?
				- 101$^{st}$ item will cost $12 extra dollars
			- The price function for the product is $p = 126 - .16x$ What is the marginal for (b) the 101st item?
				- The actual number is not far off the derivative
				- Always better to use derivative because it's quicker, easier, and clearer to understand. The actuals takes too long to calculate and really don't make much of a difference

	- (c) What is the marginal profit for the 101st item?
	- (C) [[Population change]] (population application)
		- Anytime you see the word change, we're dealing with a derivative in action
		- Anything that changes is the derivative
		- (1) If P(t) is population at time t, P'(t) is the rate of change of the population
		- (2) A bacteria growing according to the function p(t), where t is in hours, when is the population growing and shrinking?
			- Changes when derivative equals 0
				- In the range where the derivative is positive, the population is growing
				- In the range where the derivative is negative, the population is shrinking
				- In the range where the derivative is 0, the population growth is 0
