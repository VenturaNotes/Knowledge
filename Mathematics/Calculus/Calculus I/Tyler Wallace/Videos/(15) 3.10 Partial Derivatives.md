	- [[partial derivative|partial derivatives]]
	- Q: How do we calculate derivatives in 3D?
	- 3D function will have f(x, y) to result in a z variable that's a solution
		- Still a function but multiple variables inside the function
	- A) [[Partial derivative]]
		- (1) Rate of change in a specific direction
		- (2) Notation:
			- $\frac {\partial f}{\partial x}$
				- Partial derivative in x direction (left/right)
			- $\frac {\partial f}{\partial y}$
				- Partial derivative in y direction (up/down)
		- (3) To calculate: treat all other variables as constants
	- Note: Notation & process is different than implicit differentiation! $\frac {dy}{dx}$
		- In $\frac {dy}{dx}$, y was a function of x in 2 dimensions
		- y was f(x)
		- With implicit differentiation, we took the derivative of y as if it was a function of x and then multiplied by its derivative $\frac {dy}{dx}$ 
	- Now we have a 3D function that has x and y in function but these are functions. They pass the [[vertical plane test]]
		- Going in x direction while y is treated as constant or vice versa
