	- The [[derivative]] is the slope of a tangent line to a function
		- Rate of change instantaneously at a point
	- Q: How do we find the slope of a tangent line?
	- A) Two methods to find the slope of a tangent line ([[derivative]])
		- Slope of [[secant line]] (it's basically the [[slope formula]])
			- $m_{sec} = \frac {f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$
		- Move x to a to make line less secant and more tangent
		- Slope of [[tangent line]]
			- $m_{tan} = lim_{x \to a}\frac {f(x) - f(a)}{x - a}$
		- (2) Second formula for slope of [[tangent line]] (second way to find derivative at a point)
			- $m_{tan} = lim_{h \to 0}\frac {f(a+h) - f(a)}{h}$
				- Making h go to 0
	- B) [[Polynomial]]
		- 3) Equation: $y = m(x - x_1) + y_1$

	- C) Derivative of [[Fraction]]
	- D) Derivative of [[Radical]]
		- Multiplying by [[conjugate]]
