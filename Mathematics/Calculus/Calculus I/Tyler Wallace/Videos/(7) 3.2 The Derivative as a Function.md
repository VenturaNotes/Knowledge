	- Q: How can we calculate the derivative at every point?
	- A) The derivative as a function:
		- $f'(x) = \lim_{h \to 0}\frac {f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$
			- f prime of x
			- Would just need to plug-in the x value to get the actual derivative at any point we're interested in

	- How derivative is connected to graph of function
	- B) Sketch the graph of a derivative
		- (1) Derivative is slope of the tangent line
			- (a) graph is increasing, slope is positive
				- $f'(x) > 0$
			- (b) graph is decreasing, slope is negative
				- $f'(x) < 0$
			- (c) graph is flat, slope is zero
				- $f'f(x) = 0$
	- C) [[Higher order derivatives]]: Derivatives of derivatives
		- (1) Notation: 
			- Calculus developed simultaneously by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Leibniz]]
				- Newton used f(x)
				- Leibniz used y
		- (2) Formula for same idea
			- $f''(x) = lim_{x \to 0} \frac {f'(x + h) - f'(x)}{h}$
