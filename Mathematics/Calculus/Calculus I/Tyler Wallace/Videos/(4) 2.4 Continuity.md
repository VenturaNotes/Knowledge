	- Q: When is a function [[continuous]]?
	- A) Continuous
		- 1) Informal: Draw graph without lifting pencil
		- 2) Formal: Satisfy 3 conditions for all points a:
			- a) f(a) is defined
				- Function can't be undefined at the given point
			- b) $\lim_{x \to a}f(x)$ exists
			- c) $\lim_{x \to a} f(x) = f(a)$
				- Basically means that a function is continuous if the function itself equals its limit
	- B) 3 types of discontinuity (when you can't draw a graph without lifting pencil)
		- 1) [[Removable discontinuity]]
			- Able to algebraically remove the part that was discontinuous
			- hole in graph is "removable"
		- 2) [[Infinite discontinuity]]
			- $lim_{x \to 1^-} \frac {1}{x-1}$ = $- \infty$
			- $lim_{x \to 1^+} \frac {1}{x+1}$ = $\infty$
			- 1 could be any number generally
			- b) Gets a horizontal and vertical asymptote which shows an infinite discontinuity
		- 3) [[Jump discontinuity]]
			- Given a [[piecewise function]]

	- A corollary that comes out of this idea of continuity is:
		- c) [[Intermediate value theorem]] (IVT)
			- 1) If f(x) is continuous on $[a, b]$ and $z$ between f(a) and f(b), then there exists a $c$ in $[a, b]$ such that $f(c) = z$
				- There is always at least one solution for any "z" you choose and you may have more than 1 solution 
			- a) This does not work if f is not continuous, but it could (no guarantee).
			- b) This does not work if z is outside of f(a) & f(b), but it could (no guarantee).
			- c) This only tells us "at least" one solution, there may or may not be more
			- 2) We can show that a function has at least one solution
				- If we can show that there is a solution that's negative and a solution that's positive, everything between it including 0 must exist
					- We need to find a negative and positive output for f(x)
						- $\therefore$ all outputs between 1.64 and -0.788 are possible when x is between $\frac {3\pi}{2}$ and $\frac{\pi}{2}$
							- $\therefore$ 0 is a solution
								- $\therefore$ means [[therefore]]
