	- Finding derivatives around [[relations]] between x and y that are more complex than a function
		- Such as [[circle]], [[ellipse|ellipses]] or [[Hyperbola|hyperbolas]]
		- Those that don't pass the [[vertical line test]]
	- Q: How do we take the derivative if it is not a function of x?
	- (A) [[Implicit differentiation]]: We can use the chain rule with $\frac {d}{dx} y = \frac {dy}{dx}$. Then solve for $\frac {dy}{dx}$. 
		- Generally $\frac {dy}{dx}$ will be a linear function
		- Idea behind implicit differentiation
			- We take the derivative of both sides of equation using the chain rule knowing that the derivative of y is $\frac {dy}{dx}$ because y is a function of x (not just a variable). Therefore, we use chain rule and multiply by the derivative of y. Then just solve the resulting equation for $\frac {dy}{dx}$
