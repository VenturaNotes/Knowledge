	- Q: How can we evaluate [[limits]]
	- A) Basic [[Limit laws]]
		- $lim_{x \to a} x = a$
		- $lim _{x \to a} c = c$
			- If no x, limit will always approach constant
	- B) [[Limit laws]]
		- (1) Sum/difference
		- (2) Constant multiplier
		- (3) Product
		- (4) Quotient
		- (5) Power Rule
		- (6) Radical
	- C) Examples
		- In summary - [[direct substitution]]
	- D) Additional Techniques: When substitution does not work (so that substitution can work to find a limit)
		- Factor and reduce 
		- Multiply by conjugate
			- Gets rid of [[Radical|Radicals]]
			- Rationalizing the numerator in example 2

	- D) Additional Techniques Part 2
		- Multiply top & bottom by [[Least Common Denominator|LCD]]
			- Got rid of [[Complex Fraction|Complex Fractions]] this way
	- E) [[Two-sided limits]] $\to$ left & right must be equal!
		- When left and right limits not equal, you do not get a [[general limit]]
	- [[Infinite limits]]
		- (1) Properties
			- $lim_{x \to a^-} \frac {1}{x - a} = - \infty$
			- $lim_{x \to a^+} \frac {1}{x - a} = \infty$
		- (2) Positive times a negative will equal a negative
			- In this case, a $-\infty$ 
			- Isolating the "bad" part to solve

	- (G) [[Squeeze Theorem]]:
		- Great to find limits with trig properties
		- The idea is that if you have a function that you don't know the limit. You can find a function that goes above it and below it so that they all meet in the center at the same exact point
			- At the same point, they'll all have the same limit
		- The idea is that all 3 functions converge to the same point in the center and they all have the same exact limit
		- We don't have a limit rule that says we can plug the limit into the cosine
			- Just polynomials, fractions, multiplication, radicals 
			- $cos(x)$ has a bounded domain
				- Always between -1 and 1
					- Same for sine
		- $x^2$ is a [[polynomial]]
		- If the limit is less than 0 and greater than 0 or equal to, it must be equal to 0
			- Therefore, the limit equals 0 because it has been squeezed in between the other two functions that both go to 0
				- All at the same point in which they all have the same limit
					- One is always below and the other is always above
