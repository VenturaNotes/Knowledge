	- What is calculus?
		- (A) Answer to 3 questions
			- (1) What is it getting close to? ([[limit]])
			- (2) What is the slope (at a given point)? ([[derivative]])
			- (3) What is the [[area]]? ([[integral]] of function)
		- (B) [[Tangent problem]]
			- (1) Consider how fast these lines are changing (rate of change)
				- Lines shown as examples are easy to see since they're a straight line
					- First graph goes up slowly
					- Second graph goes down quickly
					- Third graph is flat, no change
			- (2) Most functions do not have a constant rate of change
				- (a) $y = x^2 + 2$ 
				- (b) The lines that touch the graph are [[tangent line|tangent lines]]
					- When a line touches the graph at one point and goes off into the distance
				- Trying to find slope of these tangent lines
			- (3) Approximate the rate of change (or tangent line) with a [[secant line]]
				- Always use m for slope
				- (a) Formula for slope of secant line
					- $m_{sec} = \frac {f(b) - f(a)}{b -a}$

	- 3 continued
		- (b) as a & b get closer, we get closer to the tangent line
			- secant starts to look like the tangent line that only touches at one spot
			- Allows us to better estimate the tangent line
	- (4) Ex: Estimate the slope and equation of tangent line to $f(x) = 2x^3 - 3$ at (2, 5) ^6f607c
		- Easy to do on graphing calculators
			- Turn on
			- Hit y= button
				- Type function into $y_1$ 
			- Hit 2nd button $\to$ table
				- To delete current values in table
					- Hit 2nd $\to$ table set
					- Change independent variable (x) to ask
				- Go back to 2nd $\to$ table
			- Now enter values we want for x (will get y values)
		- Equation of line $y = m(x - x_1) + y_1$
			- $x_1$ and $y_1$ is a point we know on the line
			- m is the slope

	- Will look at [[average velocity]] and [[instantaneous velocity]]
	- (5) The [[average velocity]] ([[speed]]) of an object can be found by $V_{ave} = \frac {f(t_1) - f(t_2)} {t_1 - t_2}$ (basically the same equation as the secant line)
		- Velocity has direction and speed does not have direction
		- (a) The [[instantaneous velocity]] (how fast an object is moving a specific point in time instead of an average over a range) is found by making $t_2$ closer to $t_1$ 
			- Basically the slope of the tangent line
		- (b) Example: An object is dropped from the top of a 144 ft cliff will land 3 seconds later. It's height is given by: $h(t) = -16t^2 + 144$. Find the average velocity between $[2, 2.01]$ and $[1.99, 2]$
		- (c) Estimate the instantaneous velocity

	- (C) Area Problem
		- (1) Consider area under $y= (x-3)^2 +1$ between (0, 3)
			- (a) rectangles (right) (known as [[right Riemann sum]] [^1])
				- Take each point and make it into a rectangle where the right corner of the rectangle touches the graph
			- (b) rectangles (left) (known as [[left Riemann sum]] [^1]))
				- Where the left corner of the rectangles touches the graph
			- (c) Estimate in middle:
				- Actual area: 12
