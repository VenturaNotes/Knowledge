	- Q: What are some derivative shortcuts?
	- A) Four basic shortcuts
		- (1) Constant
			- Derivative of a flat straight line is 0
		- (2) Power rule
		- (3) Sum rule (also known as difference rule since it works with $\pm$ )
		- (4) [[Constant multiplier]]
		- (5) Find the equation of the tangent line to
	- B) [[Product Rule]]
		- $\frac {d}{dx} f(x) \cdot g(x) = f'(x)g(x) + g'(x)f(x)$

	- C) [[Quotient Rule]]
		- $\frac {d}{dx} \frac {f(x)}{g(x)} = \frac {f'(x)g(x) - g'(x)f(x)}{[g(x)]^2}$
	- (D) Position, velocity, acceleration
		- (1) Connected by derivatives
			- (a) [[position]] - where object is at time t: s(t)
			- (b) [[velocity]] - "speed" with direction, change in position: v(t) = s'(t)
			- (c) [[acceleration]] - change in velocity : a(t) = v'(t) = s''(t)
		- (2) The position of an object in feet after t seconds is given by s(t), what is its velocity and acceleration after 2 seconds.
