	- Sometimes it is easier to use a derivative to approximate the value of an equation or function than it is to actually calculate the exact value
	- Q: How do we approximate a function at a point?
	- A) The "why" behind [[linear approximation]]
		- (1) Recall the equation of a tangent line to f(x) at a is:
			- $y = f(a) + f'(a)(x-a)$
		- (2) Close to a, it is close to f(a)
		- (3) Lines are easier than curves to calculate points!
		- (4) Example
			- (a) The linear approximation of $\sqrt{x}$ at 25
