	- Q: What are the derivatives of trig functions?
	- A) 
		- $f(x) = sinx$
			- $\frac {d}{dx} sinx = cosx$
		- $\frac {d}{dx} cosx = -sinx$
	- Derivative of $tan(x)$ is $sec^2x$ 
	- Similarly we complete all trig derivatives:
	- Derivative of $secx$ is $secxtanx$ 
	- Derivative of $cscx$ is $-cscxcotx$ 
	- Derivative of $cotx$ is $-csc^2x$
