	- Meat of the lesson
		- How to show that a value actually is the limit of some type of function
	- Q: What is the precise definition of a limit
	- A) Definition:
	- (1) Graphically:
		- Defining the limit
		- Move from "a" out a little bit each direction
			- That tiny change is called [[delta]]
		- deltas will box in some [[epsilon]] above or epsilon below
		- Challenge will be finding connection between the delta that we move left and right on bottom and the epsilon that we move up and down from the right side
			- The idea is that as we zoom in and zoom in to the actual point, will continue to be boxed in around some epsilon
			- Box allows us to not actually have a point there because we just have to be around the point. Infinitely close to the point but not actually at the point
		- For every epsilon, we need to find a delta
	- (2) Word: All $\epsilon$ > 0, there exists $\delta$ > 0 such that if $|x - a| < \delta$ then $|f(x) - L| < \epsilon$ 
		- Wanna be an epsilon within the actual limit
	- (3) Symbolically:$$lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L \iff \forall \epsilon > 0, \exists \delta > 0 \ni |x -a| < \delta \implies |f(x)- L| < \epsilon$$
		- [[Precise definition of limit]]
		- $\ni$ means [[such that]]
		- With the definition, we can take a limit and say if this is the limit, we can prove it's actually the limit by identifying the relationship between epsilon and delta
			- Known as [[epsilon-delta proofs]]
				- All proofs are identical
	- B) Structure of proof: (4 steps and 3 of the steps are scripted)

	- C) Linear examples
		- Generally, $\delta = \frac{\epsilon}{?}$
		- (1)
			- Prove $\lim_{x \to 3} 4x - 7 = 5$
				- a = 3
				- f(x) = 4x - 7
				- L = 5
			- Simplifying [[absolute value]]
				- |4x - 12| = 4|x - 3|
			- Let $\epsilon$ > 0, choose $\delta$ = $\frac {\epsilon}{4}$, assume |x - 3| < $\delta$
				- |4x - 7 - 5| = |4x-12| = 4|x - 3| < 4 $\delta$ = 4$\frac {\epsilon}{4}$ = $\epsilon$ 
			- Delta is going to be the reciprocal that we're multiplying by
			- To show proof is finished, write [[QED]]
				- Latin for "quod erat demonstrandum":
					- Literal translation: What was to be shown [^1]
				- Could include a box colored in
				- $w^5$
					- Which was what we wanted
			- Make sure to acknowledge that you got to the end of the proof
		- (2)
			- $\delta$ will equal the reciprocal of whatever we're multiplying $\delta$ by with $\epsilon$ in numerator
			- For linear examples, general strategy as we work through the steps is to make $\delta$ equal to the reciprocal of whatever is multiplied by $\delta$ 
	- D) Quadratic Examples: $\delta$ = min {1, $\frac {\epsilon}{?}$}
		- [[Absolute value]]
			- With absolute values, can just keep the absolute values around each factor
				- $|x^2 - 3x + 2$ = $|x-2||x-1|$ 
			- Will always take the more extreme value (less than) so we choose 2 instead of 0
		- The reciprocal of whatever delta is multiplied by gives $\delta = \frac {\epsilon}{?}$
