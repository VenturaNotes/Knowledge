	- Q: What is a [[limit]]?
	- (A) Intuitive definition of a limit
		- (1) The idea: what should be there, even if it is not there
		- (2) Symbolically: $lim_{x \to a} f(x) = L$
		- (3) Mathematically: as x gets closer to a, f(x) gets closer to L.
	- (B) [[Table method]]: try values closer and closer to
		- (1) Find 
			- Important part about limit is that it needs to work from both sides
			- [[(1) 2.1 A Preview of Calculus#^6f607c|Using calculator]]
		- (2) Find
			- Make sure to always work with [[radians]] in course when working with trigonometric functions
			- When not approaching any one value, the limit [[Doesn't exist|does not exist]]
	- (C) [[Graph method]]: What y-value is graph approaching?
		- If there is a hole in a graph, then the limit will be where the hole is instead of what the actual value is
			- This is because the hole is where the graph is moving closer and closer to from both sides
		- If not approaching same value from both sides, the limit [[Doesn't exist|does not exist]]
			- Limit not approaching one value

	- [[One sided limit]]
		- $lim_{x \to a^-} f(x)$
			- Only interest in limit coming from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">left side</mark>
		- $lim_{x \to a^+} f(x)$
			- Only interest in limit coming from <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">right side</mark>
		- Limit only exists if left & right are the same
	- (2) [[Piecewise function]]
		- Use a table to find limits
	- (E) [[Infinite limits]]
		- When the left limit approaches negative infinity and the right limit approaches positive infinity, the graph has a [[vertical asymptote]] at that limit
			- Would the limit be defined here?
				- Nope, the limit would not exist [^1]
				- Instead it would diverge
			- However, for $\lim_{x \to 0} \frac {1}{x^2}$ 
				- The limit would be $\infty$ [^2]
	- (F) Finding limits
		- When the limit and the point are equal to each other, that is significant.
			- We say then that the graph is [[continuous]] at that point
			- This is when the limit and point are the same
