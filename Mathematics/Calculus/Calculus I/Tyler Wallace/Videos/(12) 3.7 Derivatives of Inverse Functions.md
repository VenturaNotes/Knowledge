	- Q: What are the derivatives of the [[inverse trig functions]]?
	- A) [[Derivatives of inverses]]
		- (1) If $f^{-1}(x)$ is the inverse of f(x), then 
			- $\frac {d}{dx}f^{-1}(x) = \frac {1}{f'[f^{-1}(x)]}$
		- (2) If (a, b) is a point on f(x), the slope of the tangent line is $f'(a)$ 
			- Then (b, a) is on $f^{-1}(x)$ and the slope of the tangent line is $\frac {1}{f'(a)}$
		- (3) Ex: Find the equation of a tangent line of the inverse of f(x) at 5
			- (a) Need to find x of f(x)
			- (b) Need to find the slope of the tangent line of f(x) because we know the slope of the tangent line of the inverse is just the reciprocal of the slope
			- (c) Can now make equation of tangent lines on $f^{-1}(x)$ 
				- (switch coordinates) and (reciprocal slopes)
			- Most likely should've restricted the domain but it was good practice
		- (4) Example: the point (4, 1) is on the inverse of f(x). Find the equation of the tangent line
			- The tangent line is going to have the reciprocal slope of the function's tangent line slope

	- [[Inverse trig functions]]
	- $y = sin^{-1}x$ is not an exponent
		- This does not mean sine to the negative one power
		- It means the inverse sin of x. 
			- Might be called the [[arcsine]] of x.
	- Given a [[triangle]], we like to make the radius = 1
		- We know height = x
		- Length = $\sqrt{1 - x^2}$ 
		- This is the triangle for [[arcsine]]
	- Would be able to find the derivative of all the inverse trig functions this way
	- (2) Similarly, we get the derivatives of the inverse trig functions
		- [[Arccosine]]
		- [[arctangent]]
		- [[arccosecant]]
		- [[arcsecant]]
		- [[arccotangent]]
	- Examples
