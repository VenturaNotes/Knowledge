- f(x) = x + 1
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 2.15.44 AM.png]]
	- Shows the value of x is getting closer to 1

		- This means "Limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 from the left is 2"
		- As the x values get really close to 1
			- The $1^-$ with the superscript of minus means from the left as in, all the x values above are to the left of 1.
		- As our x values get really close to 1 but all from the left, the f(x) values get really close to 2
		- So we say, the limit f(x) as x goes to 1 from the left is equal to 2.
		- This is what happens if you're looking to the left of 0.1

		- "Limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 from the right is 2"
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 2.21.09 AM.png|400]]
		- We can talk about the notion of the limit from both sides
		- No superscript is needed here for qualification
		- "Limit of f(x) as x approaches 1 is 2"

	- As you get really close from either side (left or right), your function value will get closer to the height of 2

	- g(x) has a whole when it equals 2
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 2.26.25 AM.png|400]]
		- It's true that there is no actual point there but the limit is still 2
		- The limit doesn't care what is at the point. It only cares about what is happening when you get really close to it. As you get really close to the point, it looks like it's going to the value of 2. Therefore, we say that the limit is 2 even when the function value does not exist at the particular point. A limit still exists though
		- The limit talks about the behavior around a point even when at the point is very poorly behaved

	- "Limit of h(x) as x approaches 1 is 2"
	- Graphically
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 2.27.37 AM.png|400]]
		- Limit is an idea of what happens around the point. Not at a particular point
- General
	- $$\lim_{x\to1} f(x) = \lim_{x\to1} g(x) = \lim_{x\to 1} h(x) = 2$$ 
	- Limits of the different functions are equal even when their true values at x = 1 are different


## Definition of a limit
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 2.32.52 AM.png]]
	- We can make f(x) arbitrarily close to L by choosing x sufficiently close (but not equal) to a.
		- The above is a more intuitive definition
