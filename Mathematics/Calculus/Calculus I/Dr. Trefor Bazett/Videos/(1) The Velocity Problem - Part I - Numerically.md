- At 2:00 pm, I'm at mile marker 100
- At 2:15 pm, I'm at mile marker 110
- How fast am I going?
	- Question can be confusing. Are we talking about average or specific point in time? 
- Average velocity
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 1.29.53 AM.png]]
		- Chang in distance over change in time
		- Going average of 40mph. This is the average velocity over the 15 minute time interval

## Example 2
- What would a cop measure at 2:15PM?
	- Not enough information for this problem
	- Average velocity & instantaneous velocity are different!
- Instantaneous velocity is a limiting process

	- Looking at time intervals that get really close to 2:15 PM.
	- As time interval gets closer to some number, so does the average velocity
	- We can think of instantaneous velocity at exactly 2:15 PM to be analogous to the limiting process as the average velocities are done over smaller and smaller intervals
		- This is how modern lidar guns work (to measure how speed is
			- Sends out pulse of light and can figure out distance between cop and car is going to be. 
			- A tiny fraction later another pulse is sent out and they can get a new reading of where exactly the distance between the cop and car is
			- What we have is a super tiny time interval + a tiny change in distance (not much change since car hasn't moved a lot) 
			- They get 2 distances and 2 times and get average velocity of that interval
			- In truth, there is a whole number of pulses really quickly and you can get average of reading
		- Interprets speed at very close approximation
- Computing of average velocities is a very important process for us in the limit as our time intervals get smaller
