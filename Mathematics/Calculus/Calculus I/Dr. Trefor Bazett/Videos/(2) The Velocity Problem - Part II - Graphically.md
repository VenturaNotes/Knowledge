- Velocity problem to geometric picture
- Distance as a function of Time
- Average velocity is the slope of straight line

	- Since slope is constant, doing different intervals, we would get the same result 
	- The units above should be mph
- Another example of path between 2 points

	- Not truly physical because we need a smooth acceleration at the changing point
	- It's going at 1 velocity for awhile and then instantaneously turns into a different velocity
	- When measuring velocity, it really matters what's your starting point and finishing point
	- The steeper the slope, the faster the velocity


## Secant Line
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 1.50.58 AM.png]]
- If you have some curve and you have 2 points on it, a secant line is a straight line between 2 different points. 
- The average velocity over the entire graph is just the slope of the secant line

- Average velocity is just the net change between the start and finish of the interval. It doesn't know if you accelerate or decelerate.
- Make the slope of the secant line get closer and closer to the slope of the line around 2:15 pm
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 1.54.34 AM.png]]
	- To find the velocity at 2:15, look at secant lines where your interval is really small and near 2:15PM

## Big Idea
- The instantaneous velocity is what happens as the average velocity - ie slope of secant line - is taken over closer intervals
	- It is a limiting process
	- If you wanted to know exactly what the instantaneous velocity was, you would have to keep making your intervals smaller and smaller forever.
