- A tale of three functions
	- $f(x) = x + 1$
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 2.04.35 AM.png|300]]
		- Graph is just a straight line
	- $g(x) = \frac{x^2-1} {x-1}$

		- When you have a polynomial on the top and polynomial on the bottom, you need to ask if you can factor it. Cancel something
		- You can do the canceling when x-1 $\ne$ 0
			- Division by 0 is not defined at that point
		- Circle with hole in it means that function is not defined at that particular point.
		- g(1) not defined at that point
			- Domain is different from first function
	- $h(x) = \begin{cases} x+1 & \text {for } x \ne 1 \\ 3& \text{for } x = 1 \end{cases}$

		- This is a piecewise defined function
		- We have 2 different possible functions that h is going to be, and we're told when it's going to be which of the two ones. For the exact value of 1, it's going to be 3. For any other value, it's going to be h(x) = x + 1
- The 3 functions are different at x = 1, but otherwise they'll be the same
