- When we have a limit from the left and right go to different values
	- In this case, one goes -$\infty$ and the other goes $+\infty$ 
		- Infinity is not a value but a concept (still different)
	- Then we say that the limit does not exist (D.N.E)

	- Note: Infinite limits still don't "exist". They don't get close to a number
