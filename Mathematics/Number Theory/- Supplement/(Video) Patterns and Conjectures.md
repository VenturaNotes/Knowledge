## Intro
- Inductive Reasoning
- Conjecture
- Counterexample

## Notes 2-1 Patterns & Conjectures
### Inductive Reasoning
- Type of reasoning that reaches conclusions based on patterns
	- Your brain does this when watching a TV show, and your brain is trying to figure out what the actors are going to do next
- Example 1:
	- 3, 9, 27, 81

		- We figured out the pattern to be x3
- Example 2:

### Conjecture
- A conclusion made by using inductive reasoning; can be true or false!
	- We make statements based on observations. We try to catch a pattern. Sometimes our conjectures can be false. We make decisions on false information sometimes. That affects people, society. Can influence the lives of people negatively and positively.

## Counterexample - (Against the example)
- An example that shows a conjecture is false. You can prove a conjecture is false by finding one counterexample
	- If your conjecture is that an apple needs to be red, getting a green apple will show this conjecture to be false.

## Examples: What is a counterexample for the following conjectures?
- If a month starts with the letter J, then it is a summer month. T or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">F</mark>? If false, provide a counterexample.
	- January starts with J. 
- If flower is red, then it is a rose.
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">False</mark>
		- Carnation flower!
- You can connect 3 points to form a triangle.
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">False</mark>
		- Collinear Points
- When you multiply an integer by 2, the product is greater than the original.
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">False</mark>
		- $-2 * 2 = -4$ 
			- Makes the conjecture false.
