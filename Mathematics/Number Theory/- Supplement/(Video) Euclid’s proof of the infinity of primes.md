- Euclid showed that there are infinitely many prime numbers
- Every natural number n > 1 is divisible by some prime number. 
	- This is a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic.
- If n is greater than 1, it can be expressed as a product of powers of prime numbers
	- $n = p_1^{\alpha_1} * p_2^{\alpha_2} * ... * p_r^{\alpha_r}$ 
		- The result of factoring it
	- Any of the prime factors that appear in this factorization will divide into it.
- The set of number primes is infinite
- Method of proof
	- Reduction to absurdity:
		- We want to demonstrate P.
			- $\lnot P$ $\rightarrow$ ... $\rightarrow$ Contradiction
				- We assume not P is true and after a series of steps reach a contradiction
				- Trying to find a contradiction with the original assumption. Trying to show that it's logically inconsistent
					- Then P is true
- The set of number primes is infinite
	- Abs: The set of prime numbers is finite (denote the set of prime numbers with P)
		- P = {$p_1, p_2, ..., p_r$}
			- Under this assumption, there are a finite number of prime numbers, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc. all the way to $p_r$ 
				- $M = p_1 * p_2 * ... * p_r + 1$ 
					- If M were just a product of all the $p_i$, from $p_1$ to $p_r$, then there would be no remainder if M was divided by any of these prime numbers because they would all be factors. However, adding 1 to the product, when we divide M by any of the $p_i$, there will always be a remainder of 1.
						- We've proved there are infinitely many prime numbers.
