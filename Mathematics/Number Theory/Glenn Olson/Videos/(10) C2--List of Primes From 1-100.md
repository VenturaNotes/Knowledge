- There are 25 primes from 1-100
	- 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97
- You can use the "Sieve of Eratosthenes"
	- Cross out all numbers divisible by 2, 3, 5, and 7.

- Because we want to find all the primes to 100, we take the $\sqrt {100}$ which is 10, and the largest prime equal to or less than 10 is 7. So the only primes we need to use to find all the prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, and 7
