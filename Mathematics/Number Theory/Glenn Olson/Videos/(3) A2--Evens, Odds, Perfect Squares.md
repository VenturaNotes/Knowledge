- A2. a)
	- Where k is integer
		- Even: 2k
		- Odd: 2k + 1
- A2. b)
	- Show 10 is even
		- 10  = 2 * 5
			- Since k=5 in this instance, we've proven that 10 is even
- A2. c)
	- Show 7 is odd
		- 7 = 2 * 3 + 1
			- k=3 and since it's in that form, it's odd
- A2. d)
	- Is 0 even or odd or neither?
		- 0 = 2 * 0
			- 0 is the integer here, and proves that [[zero]] is an even number ^32ab6a
- A2. e)
	- List first 15 perfect squares
		- $1^2$ = 1
		- $2^2$ = 4
		- $3^3$ = 9
		- $4^2$ = 16
		- $5^2$ = 25
		- $6^2$ = 36
		- $7^2$ = 49
		- $8^2$ = 64
		- $9^2$ = 81
		- $10^2$ = 100
		- $11^2$ = 121
		- $12^2$ = 144
		- $13^2$ = 169
		- $14^2$ = 196
		- $15^2$ = 225
	- We can remember 13 and 14 pretty well since the digits are interchanged
