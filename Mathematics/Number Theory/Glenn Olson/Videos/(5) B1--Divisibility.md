- Divisibility is the foundation of number theory

## B1 - Divisibility Rules
- B1. a) 
	- Divisibility
		- Divide evenly with no remainder. 20 is div by 5 because $20 \div 5 = 4 \text{ R0}$ 
		- The quotient has no remainder
- B1. b) 
	- Rule for 0
		- Divisible by all integers except 0
- B1. c)
	- Rule for 2
		- If last digit divisible by 2, then entire number is divisible by 2
	- Rule for 4
		- Since $2^2$, if last 2 digits divisible by 4, then the entire number is divisible by 4.
	- Rule for 8
		- Since $2^3$ - if last 3 digits divisible by 8, entire number is divisible by 8
- B1 .d)
	- Rule for 3
		- If sum of digits is divisible by 3, then entire number is divisible by 3
	- Rule for 9
		- If sum of digits is divisible by 9, then entire number is divisible by 9
- B1. e)
	- Rule 5
		- Last digit 0 or 5
	- Rule 10
		- Last digit 0
- B1. f)
	- Rule 6
		- Since 6 = 2 * 3, it needs to meet the divisibility rules for 2 (last dig div by 2) and 3 (sum dig div by 3) at the same time.
	- Rule 12
		- Since 12 = 3 * 4, must be div by 3 and 4
			- Same thing works for any other composite number as well
