## C1 - Primes, Composites, Relative Prime
- C1. a) Prime:
	- Natural # with only two positive distinct divisors 1 and itself
		- Example 7 = 1 * 7
			- There are no other divisors
- C1. b) Composite:
	- Natural # with some other positive divisor besides 1 and itself
	- Example
		- 6 = 1 * 6
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">6 = 2 * 3</mark>
- C1. c) [[Relatively Prime]] (coprime): ^3dfd67
	- Natural numbers with no positive divisor in common besides 1
		- Example 8 & 13
			- Relatively prime because only common divisor is 1
- C1. d) What is 1?:
	- 1 = 1 * 1
		- Not distinct so not prime
		- Doesn't have another divisor besides 1 itself
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Neither</mark>
- C1. e) Smallest Composite Integer relatively prime to both 30 and 9:
	- Use prime factorization to find divisors
