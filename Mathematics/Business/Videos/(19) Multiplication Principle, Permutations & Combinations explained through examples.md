	- [[Multiplication Principle]], [[Permutation|permutations]] and [[Combination|Combinations]]
	- Multiplication principle: States that we can multiply the number of options in each category
		- A menu offers a choice of 3 salads, 8 main dishes, and 7 desserts. How many different meals consisting of one salad, one main dish, and one dessert are possible? 
	- [[Permutation]]
		- The way you order things does matter
		- $_nP_r = P(n, r) = \frac {n!}{(n-r)!}$
			- The permutation of n number of objects of r items 
			- n = total number of objects
			- r = number of items we pick out of n items
	- Can use both the permutation formula or the multiplication principle to solve this problem
		- In a club with 10 members, how many ways can a slate of 3 officers consisting of president, vice-president, and secretary/treasurer be chosen?

	- [[Combination|Combinations]]
		- From a standard 52-card deck, how many 7-card hands consist of 3 diamonds and 4 spades?
			- 204,490 is the number of hands of 7 cards which consist of 3 diamonds and 4 spades.
			- This makes sense because there are 286 combinations to choose 3 diamonds out of the 13 diamonds in the deck
			- There is a total of 715 combinations to choose 4 spades out of the 13 spades in the deck
			- Then multiply the two to get $204,490$ combinations total
		- Combinations is another way of determining the number of possible arrangements in a collection of items. Here, the order doesn't matter.
			- n = total
			- r = choosing item
			- $_nC_r = C(n,r) = \frac {n!}{(n-r)!r!}$
				- Could also think of this as permutation divided by r!
				- Since order doesn't matter, we want to remove all the repetitions
	- A 4-person [[grievance committee]] is to be selected out of 2 departments, A and B, with 15 and 28 people, respectively. In how many ways can the following committees be selected?
		- (A) 3 from A and 1 from B
		- (B) 2 from A and 2 from B
		- (C) All from A
