	- [[Simple interest]]
		- Let's say you borrow $100 from a friend and he gives you an [[interest rate]] of r=3%
		- After one year, you would pay back the friend $100 + 100(0.03)(1) = 3$ This gives \$3 of interest
		- P = initial principal amount
			- #comment The author made a mistake. It should be spelled "[[initial principal]]" which is the original amount borrowed from the [[lender]].[^1]
		- r = interest rate
		- t = time in years
	- Formula for [[simple interest]]
		- $P(t) = P + Prt$
			- Initial principal + Initial amount times the interest on the initial amount over time `t`
				- $Prt$
					- This is interest over time `t`
	- First Example: Find the total amount due on a loan of $600 at 16% interest at the end of 3 years
	- Second Example: Troy deposited $400 into his savings account. How much interest will he receive at the end of one year if the interest rate is 3%
	- Third Example: You are starting your own small business in Bari. You borrow $10,000 fro the bank at a 9% rate for 5 years
		- (a) Find the interest you will pay on this loan
			- [[Interest]] = Prt
		- (b) How much will you have to pay the bank at the end of five years?
