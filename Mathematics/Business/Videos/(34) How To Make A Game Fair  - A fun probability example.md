	- A pair of fair dice is rolled once. Suppose that you lose $11 if the dice sum to 7 and win $13 if the dice sum to 4 or 12. How much should you win or lose if any other number turns up in order for the game to be fair?
	- You want to think of it as your [[expected value]] of random variable x to equal 0
		- We want E(x) = 0
		- You would want to make $0.54 for other numbers for the game to be fair as that would make the expected value equal 0.
