	- First
		- [[Odds]]
			- The [[odds in favor]] of an event E are defined as the ratio of P(E) to P(E'), or
				- $\frac{P(E)}{P(E')}$, where P(E') $\ne$ 0
				- Favorable chances to unfavorable chances
			- The [[odds against an event|odds against]] an event E are defined as
				- $\frac{P(E')}{P(E)}$, where P(E) $\ne$ 0
				- Unfavorable chances vs favorable chances
		- P(E) means probability of an event happening
		- P(E') means probability of an event not happening
	- Second
		- If the odds that a package will be delivered on time are 17 to 3, find the probability that the package will not be delivered on time.
			- 17:3 where 17 is favorable and 3 is unfavorable
		- Probability (delivered on time) = $\frac {17}{17+3}$ = $\frac {17}{20}$
		- Probability (not delivered on time) = $\frac{3}{17+3} = \frac {3}{20}$
			- This is the complement event.
				- So could do 1 - P(delivered on time)
	- Third
		- If the odds against a particular horse winning a race are 7 to 3, what is the probability the horse will win the race?
