	- An ordinary annuity pays 7.08% compounded monthly.
		- A person deposits $200 monthly for 30 years and then makes equal monthly withdrawals for the next 15 years, reducing the balance to zero. What are the monthly withdrawals? How much interest is earned during the entire 45-year process?
			- The monthly withdraws = $2239.12
			- The amount of interest earned during the 45-year process = $331,041.60
	- [[Future value of an annuity|Future value of annuity]]
		- $F = \frac{R((1 + \frac rn)^{nt} - 1)}{\frac rn}$
	- [[Present value of an annuity]]
		- $P=\frac{R(1-(1+\frac rn)^{-nt})}{\frac rn}$
	- Sometimes $\frac rn$ and $nt$ can be used as different variables but the formulas are all equivalent
	- The interest found is $331,041.60
	- He deposited a total of $72,000
	- He withdrew a total $403,041.60
