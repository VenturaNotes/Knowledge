	- Construct the [[amortization schedule]] for a $1,000 debt that is to be amortized in four equal quarterly payments at 2.5% interest per quarter on the unpaid balance.
		- $R = \frac{P (\frac rn)}{1-(1 + \frac rn)^{-nt}}$
			- R = quarterly payments
			- P = loan amount (1,000)
			- r = interest rate
				- 1000(0.025) in this case
		- If an interest rate is stated: 2.5% interest per quarter
			- This means $\frac rn = 0.025$
		- R = $265.82$ which is the payment being made every quarter
	- Need to create 5 columns
		- Payment number
		- payment
		- interest
		- unpaid balance reduction
