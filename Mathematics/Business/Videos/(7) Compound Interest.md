	- [[Compound interest]]
		- $A(t) = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}$
			- Interest compounded monthly, weekly, daily, once a year, twice a year, and so forth
			- A(t) = Future amount
			- P = initial amount
			- r = rate
			- n = number of times an interest is invested
			- t = time
		- Future: $A(t)=Pe^{rt}$
			- This is interest that is compounded continuously 
				- [[Continuous Compounding|Continuous compounding interest]]
	- Example
		- A sum of $1000 is invested at an interest rate of 12% per year. Find the amounts in the account after 3 years if interest is compounded annually, semiannually, quarterly, monthly, and daily.
			- n = 1 (annually)
			- n = 2 (semiannually)
			- n = 4 (quarterly)
			- n = 12 (monthly)
			- n = 365 (daily)
