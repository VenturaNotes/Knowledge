	- A family has a $150,000, 30-year mortgage at 6.1% compounded monthly. Find the monthly payment. Also find unpaid balance after
		- (a) 10 years
			- What is the unpaid balance for the remaining 20 years?
			- You will have $125,765 left of loan after 10 years
				- So you paid $109,078.8 over a 10 year period
				- Interest ended up being $84,843
				- Only was able to pay off $24,235 total
		- (b) 20 years
			- What is the unpaid balance for the remaining 10 years?
	- $R = \frac{P (\frac rn)}{1-(1 + \frac rn)^{-nt}}$
		- R = monthly payment
		- P = loan amount
		- r = interest rate
		- n = number of compounding period
		- t = time (in years)
	- We found the monthly payment is $908.99$
