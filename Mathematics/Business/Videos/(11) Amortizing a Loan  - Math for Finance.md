	- [[Amortize a loan]]
		- Find the monthly house payments necessary to amortize the following loan. Then calculate the total payments and the total amount of interest paid.
			- $197,000 at 7.04% for 20 years
	- (a) The monthly payments are $1532.45
		- This is to amortize the loan
	- (b) The total mount paid on the loan is $367,788.00
	- (c) The total amount of interest paid is $170,788.00
	- $R = \frac{P (\frac rn)}{1-(1 + \frac rn)^{-nt}}$
		- Will use this formula to find the [[amortization]] on a loan
		- R = monthly payment
		- P = loan amount / present value
		- r = rate
		- t = time (years)
		- n = \# of time interest compounded in a year
