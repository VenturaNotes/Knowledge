	- Graphing [[systems of linear inequalities]]
		- Wherever the two regions overlap, that's the solution region. That's the set of points where it would satisfy both of the inequalities
	- (1) Graph the solution of the following system
		- 4x + y $\ge$ 8
			- Find x and y intercepts first
			- Pick origin to check solution 
		- [[Solution region]] is area that satisfies both inequalities
	- (2) Graph the solution of the following system
