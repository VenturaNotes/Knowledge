	- Introduction to [[probability]]
		- Probability of an [[event]] = $\frac {\text{\# of success}}{\text{total possible outcomes}}$
	- A jar contains 3 white, 4 orange, 5 yellow, and 8 black marbles. If a marble is drawn at random, find the probability that it is the following:
		- (a) White
		- (b) Yellow
		- (c) Not black
		- (d) Orange
		- (e) Black
		- (f) Orange or yellow
	- Or probability formula:
		- $P(O \text{ or } Y) = P(O) + P(Y) - P(O \cap Y)$
