	- [[Bayes' Theorem]]
		- Suppose you have 3 jars with the following contents. Jar 1 has 1 white ball and 2 black balls. Jar 2 has 4 white balls and 1 black ball. Jar 3 has 4 white balls and 1 black ball. One jar is to be selected, and then 1 ball is to be drawn from the selected jar. The probabilities of selecting the first, second, and third jars are 1/2, 1/3, and 1/6 respectively. Find the probability the ball was drawn from Jar 1, given that the ball is white.
			- What is the probability the ball was drawn from Jar 1, given that the ball is white?
	- Could draw a [[tree diagram]] here
	- Taking the probability of an [[intersection]]
		- It seems like $P(J_1 \cap W)$ = $P(J_1)*P(W)$
			- Looks like this is true for independent events
