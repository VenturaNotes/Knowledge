	- [[Compound interest]] formula
		- $A = P(1 + \frac{r}{n})^{nt}$
			- A = future amount
			- P = principal amount / initial amount
			- r = interest rate
			- n = number of times interest compounded
			- t = time (number of years)
	- Find the time required for $3000, deposited at 6% compounded quarterly, to reach at least $6000
	- If variable we're solving form is an exponent, we need to use [[Logarithm|logarithms]] to isolate it
		- Logarithm has the property which allows us to bring the exponent forward and make it into a product
		- $logA^c=clogA$
		- We're using $log_{10}$ here but it is perfect to use any other base. 
	- Formula for Time t in Compounded interest formula
		- $t = \frac{log(\frac AP)}{nlog(1 + \frac rn)}$
