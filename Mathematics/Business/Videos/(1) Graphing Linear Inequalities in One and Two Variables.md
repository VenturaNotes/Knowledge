	- Graphing [[linear inequality|linear inequalities]]
	- For $y \ge x -7$
		- Useful to find [[x-intercept]] and [[y-intercept]] to find points to create line
		- Just pick a point in a region (above or below the line) to decide which side to shade in.
	- 6x + 4y $\le$ 24
		- Finding x and y intercepts again and then picking test point to find which region to shade in. It's a solid line because we're doing less than or equal to.
		- Easiest to pick origin point to test
		- Could just use arrow to indicate which region is the solution rather than needing to shade the entire plane
