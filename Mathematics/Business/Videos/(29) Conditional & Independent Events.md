	- Conditional & [[Independent Events]]
	- A card is drawn at random from a standard 52-card deck. Events G and H are
		- G = the drawn card is black
		- H = the drawn card is divisible by 2 (face cards are not valued)
	- (A) Find P(H|G)
		- [[Conditional probability]]
	- (B) Test H and G for independence
		- We want to determine if the events are independent. Since looking at these two events
			- $P(H|G) = P(H)$
				- By definition, probability of H is not affected by knowing G has occurred for it to be independent
				- Definition of independent events
					- Occurrence of one event has no influence on the occurrence of the other
			- We found that H and G are independent events
