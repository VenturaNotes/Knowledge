	- More on [[simple interest]]
		- A radio commercial for a loan company states: "You only pay 26Â¢ a day for each $500 borrowed." If you borrow $1,758 for 249 days, what amount will you repay, and what annual interest rate is the company actually charging? (Assume a 360-day year.)
		- Note: The value `1.0052` should be `1.00052` on the left side
		- A just represents the future amount
		- Simple interest can be represented as A = P(1 + rt)
	- Example 2
		- To complete the sale of a house, the seller accepts, from the buyer, a 180-day note for $10, 000 at 7% simple interest. This means that both principal and interest will be repaid in 180 days. Because the seller wants to use the money to purchase another house, he sells the note to a third party for $10,125 after 60 days.
			- (a) How much does the buyer of the house owe when the note is due after 180 days?
			- (b) What annual rate of interest will the third party receive for his investment when the note is re-payed?
