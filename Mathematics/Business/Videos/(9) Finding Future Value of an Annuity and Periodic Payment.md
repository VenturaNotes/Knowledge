	- [[Future value of an annuity]]
		- $F = \frac{R((1 + \frac rn)^{nt} - 1)}{\frac rn}$
			- F = future value
			- R = periodic payment
			- r = interest rate
			- n = number of times the interest is compounded
			- t = time (years)
		- [[annuity]]
	- Example
		- Savings Taylor is paid on the first day of the month and $80 is automatically deducted from her pay and deposited in a savings account. If the account pays 2.5% interest compounded monthly, how much will be in the account after 3 years and 9 months?
	- Example 2
		- Find the periodic payment which will amount to a sum of $15000 if an interest rate 6% is compounded annually at the end of 16 consecutive years.
