	- A couple wishes to borrow money using the equity in their home for collateral. A loan company will loan them up to 70% of their equity. They purchased their home 10 years ago for $63,824. The home was financed by paying 15% down and signing a 15-year mortgage at 8.1% on the unpaid balance. Equal monthly payments were made to amortize the loan over the 15-year period. The net market value of the house is now $100,000. After making their 120th payment, they applied to the loan company for the maximum loan. How much (to the nearest dollar) will they receive?
	- [[Present value of an annuity]] Formula: $R = \frac{P (\frac rn)}{1-(1 + \frac rn)^{-nt}}$
		- R = periodic payment (monthly)
		- r = interest rate (in decimal)
		- n = compounding period in a year
		- t = time (in years)
		- P = loan amount
	- (1) First we find the loan amount by deducting the price of purchase ($63,824) by the amount payed down (15%)
		- P = $63,824
	- (2) Now we figure out their payment for 15 years if they were to [[amortize]] the above loan with equal monthly payments for 15 years at 8.1% interest
		- R = $521.58 (monthly payment)
	- (3) Remaining balance after 120 payments
		- There is still 60 payments left on loan
		- They still have an unpaid balance of P= $25,662.89
	- [[Equity]]:
		- Take value of house subtract remaining balance on loan 
			- A loan company will loan them up to 70% of their equity (given in problem)
		- So in the end, they couple can take a [[loan]] of up to $52,036
