	- If A and B are events such that P(A) = 0.5 and P(A' $\cap$ B') = 0.3, find P(B) when:
		- (a) A and B are [[mutually exclusive]]
			- Mutually exclusive just means that the events cannot occur at the same time
			- So the intersection of their probabilities is equal to 0
				- $P(A \cap B) = 0$
			- #question is there a difference been mutual exclusivity and disjoint sets?
		- (b) A and B are [[independent]]
			- $P(A \cap B) = P(A)P(B)$ 
	- [[Union]] formula for probability
		- $P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \cap B)$
		- Can use common terms to solve
