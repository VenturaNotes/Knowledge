	- [[Linear programming]] example 2
		- A music academy conducts a training course in vocal and guitar for both amateurs and professionals. Allocation of classes and cost of conducting the classes are given in the table. How many classes of vocal and guitar should be arranged to minimize the cost and meet the class-hour requirements? What is the minimum weekly cost of conducting classes? 
	- Found the [[feasible region]] or [[solution region]]
		- #question are these two terms the same thing?
		- Finding [[corner points]] to minimize the [[cost function]]
		- Use [[elimination method]] to find point of intersection
	- The [[objective function]] is $C = 7x + 12y$
	- The solution ends up being "6 vocal classes and 1 guitar class for \$54"
