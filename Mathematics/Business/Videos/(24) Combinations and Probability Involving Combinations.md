	- [[Combination|Combinations]] and probability
	- There are 7 rotten apples in a crate of 25 apples.
		- (a) How many samples of 4 apples can be drawn from the crate?
			- Will calculate combinations here because order does not matter
		- (b) How many samples of 4 could be drawn in which all 4 are rotten?
		- (c) How many samples of 4 could be drawn in which there are three good apples and one rotten one?
		- (d) What is the probability of getting all 4 rotten apples?
	- [[Combination]] formula
		- $C(n,r) = \frac{n!}{(n-r)r!}$
			- "read as n choose r"
