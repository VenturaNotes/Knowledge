## Examples
- (2,2,5) is a 3-tuple

	- For [[n-tuples]]

		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Repetition is OK</mark>
	- You could have a function that goes from some set S into $X^2$. Suppose S is a set of students in the class and f maps to $X^2$. For every student, it picks out a pair of colors. For example, the colored shirt and the colored pants that the particular student is wearing today. You may get a different or the same ordered pair. You may have 2 students wearing a green shirt and blue pants. Could be days of the week where on Sunday I wear a green shirt and blue pants. On Monday, I wear a red shirt and white pants

## n-tuples vs Sets:
- Sets can have different numbers of elements and order doesn't matter. We use "members" of a set.
- For sets, U=F
	- U = {R, W, B}
		- The set of colors in the United States flag
	- F =  {R, B, W}
		- The set of colors for the French flag
	- C = {R, Y}
		- Chinese flag
	- L = {R, W, R, R} 
		- Canadian flag
		- This is no good for sets

			- = {R,W} = {W, R}
