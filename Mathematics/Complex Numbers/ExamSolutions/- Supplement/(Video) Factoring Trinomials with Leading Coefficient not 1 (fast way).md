	- Multiply the leading coefficient by the 3rd term (do not say that it equals the original expression)
		- $x^2 + 7x - 18$ 
	- Factor out what multiplies to -18 and adds to 7
		- 9 and - 2
	- Divide both terms found by the leading coefficient
		- $(x+\frac 96)(x- \frac 26)$
	- Then simplify
		- $(x+\frac 32)(x- \frac 13)$
	- Lastly, move the denominator in front of the x
		- $(2x + 3)(3x-1)$
