- Solve the equation $x^3 - 4x^2 + x + 6 = 0$ given that 3 is a zero of $f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + x + 6$ 
- If f(c) = 0, then x-c is a factor of f(x)
- If x - c is a factor, then f(c) = 0
	- c is considered to be the 0 of the function
	- In the case than 3 is a zero of a function, 
		- c = 3 means that f(3) = 0 meaning that x-3 is a factor
			- This means that $f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + x + 6$  is divisible by 3
			- So we can use synthetic division or long division and divide it by x-3
- Solving the polynomial equation given one of the zeros using synthetic division

		- Found the factors of $x^2 - x -2$ where we found what multiplied to -2 and added to -1. The solution for this was -2 and 1. 
- Example 2

		- If a number is a root, then that number will be a 0 of the function
			- This root is then turned into a factor

		- Now you need to take out the GCF
			- $2(6x^2 - x - 1)$
