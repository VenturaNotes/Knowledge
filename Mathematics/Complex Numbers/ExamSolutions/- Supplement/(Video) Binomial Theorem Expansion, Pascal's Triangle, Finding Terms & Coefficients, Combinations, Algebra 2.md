	- We want to use the row where the second # is 3 because the binomial expression is raised to the 3rd power.
- Binomial Theorem
	- It helps foil difficult expressions

	- The exponents always need to add up to the exponent in the original binomial expression
	- Simplified

		- If asked what the coefficient of the second term of the binomial expression, the answer will not be 4. It will be $4(2)^3(3)^1$ 
		- Exponents associated with "y" are written in increasing order while the exponents for "x" are written in decreasing order.
		- The 4th term is $216x^1y^3$ 
			- The coefficient of the 4th term is 216

	- We needed to find what the 4th term was of the binomial expression, and we found it to be $-34560x^3y^3$ by using binomial theorem expansion

	- We can use combinatorics to find a value in Pascal's Triangle
	- The general equation is used to find the $n^{th}$ term of binomial expansion
	- Examples of above are shown for finding terms and coefficients as well as combinations.
