	- The complex numbers u and v are given by $u = 1 + (2\sqrt{3})i$ and $v= 3 + 2i$. In an argand diagram, u and v are represented by the points A and B respectively.   A third point C lies in the first quadrant and is such that BC = 2AB and angle $ABC = 90\degree$. Find the complex number z represented by C, giving your answer in the form x + iy, where x and y are real and exact.
