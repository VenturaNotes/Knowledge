	- If you have the square root of 2 or more values being multiplied together, it's the same as the square root of each one of them being multiplied together.

	- Use the quadratic formula if you can't factorize an equation

	- Given an equation $x^2 - 6x + 10 = 0$, we get the graph below. The equation does not intersect the x-axis

	- Whenever you get something of the format $3 \pm i$ which is $a + bi$, it's called a complex number.
		- a is called the "real" part
		- bi is called the "imaginary" part
	- With $3 \pm i$ 
		- We have 2 complex numbers here
		- The roots of our quadratic equation are called imaginary roots
			- 3 - i
			- 3 + i
		- All complex numbers have the form a + bi
			- a: Real part
			- b: Imaginary part

	- Problem #1
		- The real part was 0
		- Imaginary part was +7 or -7
	- Problem #2 
		-  The real part was -1
		- Imaginary part was +2 or -2
	- Problem #3
		- By the factor theorem, (x-1) must have been a factor because x=1 is a solution to the cubic equation
		- It gives 1 real root and 2 imaginary roots
