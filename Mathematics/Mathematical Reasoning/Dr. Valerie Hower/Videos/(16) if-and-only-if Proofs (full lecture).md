	- Slide 1 ([[if-and-only-if proofs]])
		- Proving if-and-only-if statements
			- [[Biconditional]]
				- Must show 2 things
					- $p \implies q$
					- $q \implies p$ ([[converse]])
	- Slide 2
		- Ex: For x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, prove $x^2 |x$ if and only if x $\in$ {-1, 0, 1}
	- Slide 3
		- Ex: for x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, prove x is odd if and only if -x is odd.
	- Slide 4
		- For x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, prove 10|x if and only if 5|x and 2|x
		- [[Lemma]]: For a, b $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, if ab is even then a is even or b is even
			- pfof Lemma (means proof of lemma?)
			- This is something you could use if you have a product of two integers and you know it's even that it must be the case that one of the integers is even
			- [[Implication]]

	- Slide 1
		- Using the lemma found
	- Slide 2
		- For x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, prove x is odd if and only if 5x + 4 is odd
