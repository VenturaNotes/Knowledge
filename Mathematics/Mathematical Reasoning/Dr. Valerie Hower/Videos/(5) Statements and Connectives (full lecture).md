	- What is a [[statement]]?
		- A declarative sentence that is either true or false
		- Examples
		- A sentence is not a statement when the truth is ambiguous
			- x < 8 can be true and also cannot be true
		- "Be kind" is a command
	- Often, we use letters P, Q, R for [[statement|statements]]
		- Might see them as capital or lowercase letters
	- We will combine statements using [[connectives]] (and, or, not)
	- Notation
		- [[And]]: $\land$
		- [[Or]]: $\lor$ 
		- [[Not]]: $\lnot$ or $\sim$ 
	- Suppose p and q are statements
		- [[And]]: p $\land$ q is true only when both p and q are true
	- We can describe a [[compound statement]] using the [[truth table]]
	- [[Or]]: $p \lor q$ is true when p is true or q is true or both are true
	- [[Not]]: $\lnot$ p ($\lnot p$ )
		- Has opposite truth of p (statement)

	- For P(x), you can evaluate at 2 giving P(2)
	- The [[conditional statement]] (aka [[Implication]])
		- p, q statements
			- $p \implies q$
			- p $\rightarrow$ q
		- Read as "If p then q" or "p implies q"
	- Example: Mateo says to Sean:
		- "If we are roommates then I will cook everyday."
			- When is Mateo not telling the truth?
				- Scenario 1 (True)
					- Mateo and Sean are roommates
					- Mateo cooks everyday
				- Scenario 2 (False)
					- Mateo and Sean are roommates
					- Mateo does not cook everyday
				- Scenario 3 (True)
					- Mateo and Sean are not roommates
					- Mateo cooks everyday
				- Scenario 4 (True)
					- Mateo and Sean are not roommates
					- Mateo does not cook everyday
