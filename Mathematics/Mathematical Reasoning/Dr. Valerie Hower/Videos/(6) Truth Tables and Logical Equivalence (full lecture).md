	- [[biconditional|biconditional statement]]
		- p $\iff$ q
		- p $\leftrightarrow$ q
			- "p if and only if q"
		- True provided p and q have the same truth value
	- Definition: Two [[Compound statement|compound statements]] are [[logically equivalent]] provided they have the same truth value for every possible input
		- Will use truth tables
	- Let's show if the statements are logically equivalent
		- Use intermediate steps
		- As columns 3 and 6 have the same truth values $p \iff q = (p \implies q) \land (q \implies p)$
	- Another proof example
		- One of [[De Morgan's Laws]]
			- $\lnot(p \lor q) = (\lnot p) \land (\lnot q)$ 
			- $\lnot(p \land q) = (\lnot p) \lor (\lnot q)$ 
		- As columns 4 and 7 have the same truth values for all possible inputs, we've shown with a truth table that $\lnot(p \lor q) = (\lnot p) \land (\lnot q)$ 
	- Proof
		- As columns 2 and 6 have the same truth values for all possible inputs, 
			- $(p \implies q) \land ((\lnot p) \implies q) = q$

	- Definition: A [[tautology]] is a statement that is always true
		- $T$ 
			- Bolded T
	- A [[contradiction]] is statement that is always false
		- $F$ 
			- Bolded F
	- Given an [[Implication]] $p \longrightarrow q$, we have
		- [[converse]]: q $\implies$ p
		- [[inverse]]: $(\lnot p)$ $\implies$ ($\lnot q$)
		- [[contrapositive]]:$(\lnot q)$ $\implies$ $(\lnot p)$ 
	- Implication and contrapositive are [[logically equivalent]]
	- Converse and inverse are logically equivalent
	- Logically equivalent is what equals means when talking about statements
	- As columns 5 and 8 have the same truth values, we find the left and right sides to be logically equivalent
		- $p \lor (q \land r) = (p \lor q) \land (p \lor r)$
