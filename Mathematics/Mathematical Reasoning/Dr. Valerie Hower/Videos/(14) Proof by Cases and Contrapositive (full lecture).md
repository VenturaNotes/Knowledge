	- Slide 1
		- For a, b $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, Prove: If a is even or b is [[odd]], then a(b+3) is [[even]]
		- [[Proof by Exhaustion|proof by cases]]
			- It seems like there are only 2 cases we need to write because writing the case where a is even and b is odd would be redundant. 
	- Slide 2
		- If n $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, then $1 + (-1)^n (2n-1)$ is a [[multiple]] of 4.
			- Checking if integer is [[odd]] or [[even]]
	- Slide 3
		- Sometimes proving an [[Implication]] directly is a challenge
			- Could use proof by [[contrapositive]]
				- Assume $\lnot q$ is true
				- Show $\lnot p$ is true
				- Due to logical equivalence, we would have in fact proved the implication
	- Slide 4
		- Prove for $n \in \mathbb{Z}$, if $3n^2 + 1$ is even, then n is odd
			- [[Proof by contrapositive]]

	- Slide 1
		- Let a, b $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$ . Prove: If a + b $\ge$ 15, then a $\ge$ 8 or b $\ge$ 8
		- Proof by contrapositive
	- Slide 2
		- For n $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$, prove if $n^3$ is even then n is even
			- Taking a root has no guarantee that you'll have an integer
			- Could use [[binomial theorem]] for this
	- Slide 3
		- Combines contrapositive and cases
			- [[divides]]
