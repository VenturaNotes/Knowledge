	- Definition: Given a statement S, the [[negation]] of S is $\lnot$ S
	- [[De Morgan's Laws]]
	- How do we negate p $\implies$ q?
		- Negating an [[Implication]]
			- First showing in truth table
			- Then use [[De Morgan's Laws]]
	- If Serena is smiling, then Serena is not sad
		- Negation of implication: 
			- Serena is smiling and Serena is sad
	- Negating [[quantifiers]]
		- Ex: "Not all integers are even"
			- There is an integer that is not even
		- Rules
			- $\lnot(\forall x, P(x)) = \exists x, \lnot P(x)$
			- $\lnot(\exists x, P(x)) = \forall x, \lnot P(x)$

	- Negating Quantifiers
		- Example: Negate: There is a rational number that is not an integer (this statement is true. $\frac 12$ is a good example. It's a rational number but not an integer)
			- All rational numbers are integers is a false statement when negating
	- Can negate [[nested quantifiers]]
	- Negating a false statement should give a true statement
		- For negation of second problem, y could depend on x to $\ne$ 2 or you could just say y = 0 since there won't exist an x that makes xy = 2
	- Example: Negate
		- There is an integer that is neither even nor odd
			- Every integer is even or odd (this negation is true)
	- Negate
		- For all [[natural numbers]] x, if x is [[prime]] then $\sqrt{x}$ is not [[rational]]
			- This statement is true
		- There is a natural number x that is prime and $\sqrt{x}$ is rational
			- This statement is false
