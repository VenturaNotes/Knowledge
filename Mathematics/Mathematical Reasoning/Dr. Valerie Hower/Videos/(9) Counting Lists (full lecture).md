	- [[Counting]]
		- Example: My son Sebastian must select a meal for lunch at school
			- Main Course
				- Ham sandwich
				- Chicken Nuggets
				- Mozzarella Sticks
				- Pizza
			- Side
				- Fruit cup
				- Carrots
				- Raisins
			- Drink
				- Water
				- Milk
		- How many lunches are possible?
			- $4*3*2 = 24$
				- [[Multiplication principle]]
			- Can draw a [[tree diagram]] to see all of the possibilities
	- Definition: A [[list]] is an ordered sequence of elements.
		- The parentheses tells you it's a list (These 3 examples are all different)
			- (1, 8, 5)
				- Length 3
			- (8, 1, 5)
				- Length 3
			- (1, 1, 8, 8, 5, 5)
				- Length 6
	- An [[ordered pair]] is basically a list of length 2
		- [[Cartesian product]]
	- [[Multiplication rule]] (Stated for list of length 2)
		- If we have m choices for 1st element in a list and for each of the m choices, we have n choices for the second element of the list. Then total number of lists is $m \times n$ 
	- Recall: |A| = m and |B| = n
		- We mentioned |A $\times$ B| = |A||B| = m $\times$ n
			- A $\times$ B = length 2 lists where 1st element is in A and 2nd element is in B
		- This formula comes from the multiplication rule
	- A lot of counting generally can come down to thinking about sets and Venn diagrams
	- Example: How many 5 digit zip codes can be made with
		- No restrictions?
		- Only even digits?
		- No digits repeated?
			- Notation P(10, 5)
				- Means $\frac {10!}{5!}$

	- P(n, k) = number of lists of length k of n elements no repetition
		- $\frac {n!}{(n-k)!}$
		- P comes from [[Permutation|permutations]]
			- k permutations of n elements (orderings)
				- Orderings of k elements chosen from a collection of n 
	- [[factorial]]
		- n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$
		- $n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...3*2*1$
		- $0! = 1$
		- $n! = n(n-1)!$
	- How many 5 digit zip codes can be made with
		- Exactly one 7?
			- Can use [[addition rule]]
				- They are all [[disjoint]]
				- Says that we have a collection of [[pairwise disjoint sets]], to get the cardinality of the union, just add up the cardinalities of the individual sets
				- $|A_1 \cup A_2  \cup ... \cup A_n| = \Sigma_{i=1}^n|A_i|$ 
		- At least one 7?
			- [[Subtraction rule]]
				- Counting comes up to sets
				- $|\overline A| = |U| - |A|$ 
					- All zip codes (5-digit) - Zip codes with no 7s = zip codes with at least one 7
