	- $\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}, \forall y \in \mathbb{Z}, xy \notin \mathbb{N}$ 
		- This is true. If x = 0, then that means $x*y$ can never equal a natural number

	- (9) How many 7-element strings can be made from the eight letters A, G, I, K, R, T, W, Z (Note: unless otherwise noted, repetition is allowed)
		- (a) are there?
			- [[Multiplication rule]]
		- (b) begin with R and end with T?
		- (c) begin with A or W?
		- (d) have exactly four Zs?
		- (e) have 7 distinct letters (i.e. no letter is repeated)?
			- P(8, 7) or 8!

	- (12) Give a [[combinatorial proof]]
		- Since we see binomial coefficients, we'd like to use counting subsets
		- Pf: Suppose we have <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">n</mark> students in a class. We want <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">r</mark> students to work on a project and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">k</mark> of the <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">r</mark> students to present the project. We may count the number of ways to select <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">r</mark> students from the class and <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">k</mark> students of the group of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">r</mark> as follows
			- Option 1: First, select <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">r</mark> of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">n</mark> students for group then <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">k</mark> of <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">r</mark> students to present. There are $n \choose r$$r \choose k$ ways
			- Option 2: First, select <mark style="background: #ADCCFFA6;">k</mark> of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">n</mark> students to be presenters. Then, out of the remaining n-k students, select r-k to fill group of r students for project. There are $n \choose k$$n-k \choose r-k$ ways
		- Demonstration
			- n = 8, r = 5, k = 3
			- Showing $n \choose r$$r \choose k$ = $560$
				- $n \choose r$ = $8 \choose 5$ = 56
				- $r \choose k$ = $5 \choose 3$ = 10
				- $56 * 10 = 560$
			- Showing $n \choose k$$n - k \choose r -k$ = 560
				- $n \choose k$ = $8 \choose 3$ = 56
				- $n -k \choose r-k$ = $5 \choose 2$ = 10
				- $56*10 = 560$
