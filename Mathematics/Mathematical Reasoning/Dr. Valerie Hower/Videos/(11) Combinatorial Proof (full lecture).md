	- Given a set A with |A| = n, why is |$\mathcal{P}$(A)| = $2^n$ 
		- [[Multiplication rule]]
		- Subsets have no order and lists of length n have order
	- Give a [[combinatorial proof]] of the identity
		- Need to have a counting question. Then show the lefthand side of an identity and the righthand side of an identity both count the same thing.
			- If you have 2 expressions that count the same thing, they must be equal
		- Seem to be using [[addition rule]] for first question
	- [[Pascal's Identity]] proof
		- If you see a single binomial coefficient, think subsets somehow
	- Want to use a counting argument
	- Another [[combinatorial identity]] example
		- If we see a single binomial coefficient on one side, count subsets
		- [[disjoint sets]]
		- Using [[addition rule]]

	- Last proof
		- Since no binomial coefficients, not counting subsets
		- [[Multiplication rule]]
	- We know that given a list of length 3 where n is the number of elements in A, $n^3$ is the number of length 3 lists using elements in A.
