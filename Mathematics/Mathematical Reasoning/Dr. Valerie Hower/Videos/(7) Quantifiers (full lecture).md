	- Recall: Often we have a declarative sentence P(x)
		- P(x) is not a statement as truth value is ambiguous
	- Can create statements using [[quantifiers]]
		- $\forall$: [[for all]]
			- $\forall$xP(x) is true provided P(x) is true for every x
		- $\exists$: [[It exists|there exists]]
			- $\exists$xP(x) is true provided P(x) is true for at least one x
	- $\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}, x^2 = 2$
		- False. Would be false even if $\mathbb{Z}$ was $\mathbb{Q}$ 
	- [[Nested Quantifiers]]: Order matters
		- There are 4 different types
			- $\forall x \forall y, P(x, y)$
				- P(x, y) is true for every possible (x, y)
					- In some cartesian product
					- True for every possible pair
			- $\forall x \exists y P(x, y)$
				- y depends on x
				- So for any x you choose, there will be a y that will make P(x, y) true
			- $\exists x \exists y, P(x, y)$
				- There is at least one pair where P(x,y) is true
			- $\exists x \forall y P(x, y)$ 
				- There is one x that works for every single y
				- This is saying that there exists an x that will work for all y such that P(x, y) is true

	- [[empty set]] example
	- Are these equivalent?
		- No for first
		- yes for second
			- Both expressions are true provided P(x) is true for every x and Q(x) is true for every x
	- There is no [[integers|integer]] that is both even and odd
		- Can prove this through [[contradiction]]
