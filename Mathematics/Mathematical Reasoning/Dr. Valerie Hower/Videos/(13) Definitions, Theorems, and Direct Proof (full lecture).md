	- Slide 1
		- [[Mathematics]] involves precise language
			- Use complete sentences
			- Use words correctly
		- Example: "The shortest distance between any 2 points is a straight line"
			- Uses words incorrectly
				- Distance: nonnegative number
				- Line is not a number
	- Slide 2
		- $\mathbb{Z}$ [[integers]]
		- Definitions
			- An integer y is [[even]] provided there exists an integer k such that y = 2k
			- An integer y is odd provided there exists an integer k such that y = 2k + 1
		- We may use: $\mathbb{Z}$ say x, y $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$
			- $xy, x-y, x+y \in \mathbb{Z}$ 
			- $\frac {x}{y}$ is not guaranteed to be in $\mathbb{Z}$ 
	- Slide 3
		- $\mathbb{Z}$ integers
		- Definitions
			- Let a, b $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$. We say "a [[divides]] b" (written a|b) provided $\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $ax = b$ 
				- The idea is that b over a is an integer
				- $\huge\nmid$ means does not divide
				- Interestingly 0 $\mid$ 0 is true since 0(1) = 0
					- Not saying $\frac 00$ is an integer though
	- Slide 4
		- $\mathbb{Z}$ Integers
		- Definitions
			- When a | b, a is a [[divisor]] or [[factor]] of b. b is a [[multiple]] of a
			- An integer $p > 1$ is [[prime]] provided the only positive divisors of p are 1 and p
				- Examples
					- 2 is the only even prime number
					- Largest prime number
						- $2^{82,589,933}-1$ 
			- An integer $x > 1$ is [[composite]] if it is not prime
				- Meaning $\exists n$ integer 1 < n < x and n | x

	- Slide 1
		- Examples of composites
		- 0, 1 are both neither prime nor composite
	- Slide 2
		- [[Theorem]]: True statement for which there is a proof
		- Example: 
			- If f(x) is [[differentiable]] at x = a, then f(x) is [[continuous]] at x=a
		- Example
			- [[Diverge]]
		- These are both of form $p \implies q*$ 
			- [[Implication]]
		- In a [[direct proof]] of an implication $p \implies q$
			- assume p is true
			- show q is true
	- Slide 3
		- Prove for n $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$ if n is [[odd]] then $n^2$ is odd
			- Need to work with an arbitrary odd integer
			- Adding, multiplying or subtracting an integer, you will fall back into the integers
		- Proof:
			- Let $n \in \mathbb{Z}$ be odd. Then $\exists x \in \mathbb{Z}$ with $n=2x+1$
			- Then, $n^2 = (2x+1)^2 = 4x^2 + 4x + 1 = 2(2x^2 + 2x) + 1$
				- Which is odd as $2x^2 + 2x \in \mathbb{Z}$
				- Thus, $n^2$ is odd

	- Slide 1
		- Prove: for n $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$ if n is [[even]], then 3n + 8 is even
	- Slide 2
		- Prove for a, b $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$ if a, b are even then 4|(ab)
		- These proofs read like sentences
	- Slide 3
		- Prove for a, b, c $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$
		- If a|b and a|c, then a|(b+c)
		- [[divides]] examples
