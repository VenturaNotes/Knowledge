	- When counting subsets, we need to be able to use [[binomial coefficient|binomial coefficients]]
		- $n \choose k$ or C(n, k)
			- The # of k-element subsets of an n-element set
			- n and k should be nonnegative integers
				- To be defined, k should be less than or equal to n
			- The # of ways to choose k elements from n
		- For P(3, 2)
			- Number of lists of length 2 from {1, 2, 3} (no repetition)
		- $n \choose 0$ = 1
			- This is how many 0-element subsets from an n-element. set
				- The only 0-element subset of an n-element set is the [[empty set]]
		- $n \choose n$  = 1
			- Number of n-element subsets from n-element set
				- If A has n elements, then A is the only n-element subset
		- $n \choose 1$ = n
			- This would just be the [[singleton|singletons]]
	- Formula
		- $n \choose k$ = $n \choose n-k$ [^1]
			- If we have n objects to choose and we include k objects, then there are $n \choose k$ ways of choosing these objects
			- This also means we choose not to include $n-k$ objects giving $n \choose n-k$
			- Example given {A, B, C, D, E}
				- $5 \choose 2$
					- AB, AC, AD, AE, BC, BD, BE, CD, CE, DE
					- = 10 combinations
					- For each combination, the letters excluded will be the ones found in $n \choose n-k$ 
						- AB $\iff$ CDE
						- AC $\iff$ BDE
						- AD $\iff$ BCE
						- AE $\iff$ BCD
						- BC $\iff$ ADE
						- BD $\iff$ ACE
						- BE $\iff$ ACD
						- CD $\iff$ ABE
						- CE $\iff$ ABD
						- DE $\iff$ ABC
						- = 10 combinations
				- They are complements of each other
	- [[binomial coefficient]]: $n \choose k$
		- Generally, a binomial is the sum of 2 terms
		- Called binomial coefficients because they appear as coefficients when you expand a power of a binomial. This is what's called [[binomial theorem]]
			- For n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$, $(x+y)^n$ = $\Sigma_{k=0}^n$ $n \choose k$ $x^ky^{n-k}$

	- Example: For n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$, use the binomial theorem to prove this [[combinatorial identity]]
		- Will use a [[combinatorial proof]] in next lesson
	- [[Pascal's Triangle]]
		- Border consists of all 1's
		- An interior value is sum of 2 numbers above
	- Pascal's triangle consists of binomial coefficients arranged along rows
	- [[Pascal's Identity]]
		- $n \choose k-1$ + $n \choose k$ = $n + 1 \choose k$ 
			- $n \choose k$ is $3 \choose 2$ in the circled part of pascal's triangle above
		- Will prove this with a combinatorial proof on next lesson
	- Comment: P(n, n) = $\frac {n!}{0!}= n!$ 
		- All orderings of n elements of n = 5
			- n! Is the number of ways to permute n items in a line
