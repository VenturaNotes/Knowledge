	- Definition: The [[complement]] of a set A
		- Need U [[universe]]: A $\subseteq$ u
			- The complement of A: A = U - A
	- Given set B, the complement takes the elements not in B
		- Written as $\overline B$ 
	- In this example, they're equal. Will be proving them with set theoretic proofs. However pictures are not set theoretic proofs but gives a beautiful way to visualize sets
		- $\overline{A} \cap \overline{B} = \overline{A \cup B}$ 
		- $B - \overline{A} = A \cap B$
		- $A \cap \overline{B} = A - B$ 
	- Will visualize [[set equality]] in a [[Venn diagram]]
	- In our example, we had the above equalities
	- We may visualize sets and set operations using [[Venn diagram|Venn diagrams]]

	- Want the regions shaded to be matched up
	- Draw a Venn Diagram for the following sets
		- 3 sets in Venn Diagram
	- Find an expression corresponding to the Venn Diagram
	- In (B - A) - C
		- The parentheses are quite important
	- Question: For finite sets A, B
		- Is $|A \cup B|$ = $|A| + |B|$?
			- Generally not true
			- When A, B are [[disjoint]], then  $|A \cup B|$ = $|A| + |B|$
				- Disjoint means that the intersection between 2 sets is empty
					- $A \cap B = \varnothing$ 
	- [[Cardinality]] of [[union]] of sets
		- $|A \cup B| = |A| + |B| - |A \cap B|$
