	- Sounds are mathematically added together
	- Decomposition is an operation that's in some sense opposite of addition.
	- Addition combines several things to form a single sum
	- Decomposition takes the sum apart into the individual elements that formed it. 
	- You can think of your ear as a linear algebra machine that performs decomposition 
		- Sounds get added together before they enter your ear. So your ear only receives the combined signal (yet you're able to hear the individual sounds)
		- So your ear is a nearly perfect decomposition device
			- This is surprising because when we add things together and only retain the sum, then some information is typically lost and decomposition is not possible
				- For example, if you find multiple dollars and quarters which sum to $100, there is no unique way to find the solution to this with only the sum. It could've been 100 $1 bills or 400 quarters
				- Decomposition is not possible here because there isn't a unique way to answer this question. And if you consider negative numbers or even arbitrary real numbers which is typically done in linear algebra, there is an infinite number of ways to solve this
	- The difference is the richness of the elements involved (when it comes to decomposing dollars vs sound). So we're able to decompose sound and not dollars because individual numbers are not very rich objects. 
		- So the individuality of the separate elements that form the sum simply gets lost when the sum is formed (which is not the case with sound)
			- Sounds are so complex and rich that just about all the information is retained when sum is formed. 
	- So when we study decomposition, we'll very carefully classify the situations where
		- Decomposition is possible in a unique way
		- Decomposition impossible because there are infinitely many ways to break up the sum
		- Decomposition impossible because there are no ways to break up the sum into the constituent elements
