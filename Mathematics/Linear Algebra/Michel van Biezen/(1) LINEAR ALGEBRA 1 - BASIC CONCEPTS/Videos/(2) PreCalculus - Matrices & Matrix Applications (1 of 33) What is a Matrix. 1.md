	- [[System of Linear Equations]]
		- Find the x and y value which satisfies both equations
	- [[Matrix]]
		- Has the numbers which are equal to the coefficients x and y
		- Number of rows equals number of equations in a system
		- Number of columns represents the number of variables
	- [[Augmented Matrix]]
		- Includes the constant on right side of equal sign
	- $2 \times 2$ Matrix = 2 Rows $\times$ 2 Columns
	- If # of rows = # of columns $\implies$ [[square matrix]]
