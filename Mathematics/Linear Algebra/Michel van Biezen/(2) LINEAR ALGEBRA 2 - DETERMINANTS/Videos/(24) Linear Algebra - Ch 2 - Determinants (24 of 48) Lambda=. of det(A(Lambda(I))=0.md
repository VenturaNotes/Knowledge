	- Find $\lambda$ such that det(A - $\lambda$$I_2$) = 0
		- We want to find the value of the constant ($\lambda$) in such a way that if we take the determinant of A minus the constant times the identity matrix ($I_2$ means a 2x2 matrix).
		- [[Lambda]]
			- This symbol is usually used for eigenvalues but that's not what it means at this point. So just assume it's a constant in this case
