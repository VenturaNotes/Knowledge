	- Rules of a [[determinant]]
		- (1) If c is a [[constant]] and A is an $n \times n$ Matrix
			- $|cA| = c^n|A|$ 
				- n = order of the matrix
					- So 2x2 matrix or 3x3 matrix
		- (2) For an $n \times n$ determinant
			- $|-A| = (-1)^n |A|$
		- (3) [[Distributive Property]]
			- $|AB| = |A| |B|$
		- (4) [[Identity Matrix]]
			- $|I| = |AA^{-1}| = |A||A^{-1}| = 1$
		- (5) Therefore (conversely)
			- |A| = $\frac {1}{|A^{-1}|}$
		- (6) $|BAB^{-1}| = |B||A||B^{-1}|= |B||A|\frac{1}{|B|} = \frac{|B|}{|B|}|A| = |A|$
		- (7) $|A| = |A^T|$
			- Determinant of A is equal to the determinant of the [[transpose]] of A
		- (8) $|\overline{A}|$ = $\overline{|A|}$
			- The determinant of the complex conjugate of matrix A is equal to the determinant of matrix A and then taking the [[complex conjugate]] of it.
		- (9) If 2 rows of A are identical
			- $|A| = 0$
		- (10) If A has a row of zeros 
			- $|A| = 0$
		- (11) If the rows of A are [[dependent]]
			- $|A| = 0$
		- (12) If A is not [[invertible]]
			- $|A| = 0$
		- (13) If A is invertible
			- $|A| \ne 0$
