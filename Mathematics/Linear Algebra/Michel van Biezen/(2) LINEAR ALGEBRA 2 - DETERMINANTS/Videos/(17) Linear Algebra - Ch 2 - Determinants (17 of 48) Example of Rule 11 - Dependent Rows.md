	- A matrix with [[dependent rows]]
		- If rows are dependent, |A| = 0
			- Determinant of matrix A = 0
	- If we can find a constant such that we multiply the first column by that constant and then find a different constant (or at least another constant. Second constant could have the same value as the first constant), which multiplies the second column, If adding those 2 new columns together equals the 3rd column, we can say that the rows are dependent
