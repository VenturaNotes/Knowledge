	- Determinants are used for
		- (1) Analyzing systems of linear equations
		- (2) Solving systems of linear equations (Cramer's rule)
		- (3) Method of least squares
		- (4) Finding the inverse of a matrix
		- (5) Determining if a matrix has an inverse
		- (6) Finding the characteristic equation of a matrix
			- Find [[eigenvalues]] (characteristic roots of the characteristic equations)
			- Find [[eigenvectors]]
		- (7) Solving differential equations
			- Will use eigenvalues and eigenvectors for this
		- (8) Finding area and volume of geometric shapes
