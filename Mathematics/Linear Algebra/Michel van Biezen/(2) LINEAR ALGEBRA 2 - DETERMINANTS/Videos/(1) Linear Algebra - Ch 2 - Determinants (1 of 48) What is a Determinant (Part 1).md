	- Definition always starts with: "A determinant of a square matrix is...."
		- The determinant is some sort of operation that you do on square matrices
	- The [[determinant]] of a square matrix is a computed value (a single number), which is computed from the elements of that square matrix
	- This computed value can be used to solve a system of linear equations, to analyze those solutions and to perform a number of other mathematical operations including finding the inverse of a matrix, to find [[eigenvalue|eigenvalues]], solve differential equations, etc.
	- Ex: A [[non-homogeneous system]] of linear equations has a unique solution if and only if the determinant of the system's matrix is non-zero.
