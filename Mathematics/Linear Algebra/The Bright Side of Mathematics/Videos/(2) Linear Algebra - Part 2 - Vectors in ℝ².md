	- Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$
		- $\mathbb{R}^2$ is a [[vector space]]
	- Vectors are not arrows
		- Imagine vectors as arrows but don't say they are arrows
	- Calculation rules visualized:
		- [[Scaling]] works for any real number $\lambda$ 
			- When we have a fixed vector v, we can scale it
			- The new vector we get out is scaled by this factor $\lambda v$ 
			- In our picture, the direction of vector is still the same but the length can be different
		- [[Addition]]
			- Need two vectors
			- Put both arrows together
				- Put tail of one to tip of other one
	- In [[mathematics]], we usually don't put the arrow above $v$ to represent vectors because we usually know what the objects are. There is simply no need for such a notation
		- Contrast to [[physics]] where the arrow above the letter carries implicit information
	- Definition $\mathbb{R}^2 = R \times R$
		- [[Cartesian product]]
		- $\mathbb{R}^2$ is simply the set of all ordered pairs of real numbers
		- In [[linear algebra]], the elements of $\mathbb{R}^2$ are written in a so-called [[column form]]
			- For the pair, instead of left and right, we have top and bottom
			- $4 \choose 2$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R}^2$ 
				- Mathematically, this is just a point in a plane
				- Could also visualize it as an arrow when you say how I come from the origin to that point
					- Go 4 steps to the right
					- Go 2 steps to the top
				- For [[scaling]], just multiply both numbers my $\lambda$ 
					- For $\lambda v_1 \choose \lambda v_2$
					- Have the first component as $\lambda v_1$ and the second [[component]] $\lambda v_2$ 
						- In the first and second component, we have the ordinary multiplication of real numbers
				- For [[addition]], add both numbers separately
					- For both, need the components
	- $\mathbb{R}^2$ together with the two operations ($\cdot$, +) is called the vector space $\mathbb{R}^2$
