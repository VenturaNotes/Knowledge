	- [[Linear algebra]]
	- Applications
		- A problem could have fixed quantities (a, b, c, d)
		- Unknowns are variables we don't know yet (x, y, z)
	- Linear algebra can help when we know the relations between the quantities
		- In some sense, we need simple relations between the variables
		- Then with linear algebra, we can find all the possible solutions for the unknowns
		- Therefore, linear algebra is the important tool which helps us solve our problem
			- find all solutions for $x, y, z$ 
	- Abstract level
		- [[Vector space]]
			- Fundamental concept
		- [[vectors]]
			- Objects
		- [[Linear maps]]
			- Now we have something that can transform vectors
	- Concrete level
		- Instead of abstract vector space, will start with $\mathbb{R^n}$ 
		- A linear map corresponds to something we can put in a table
			- Such a table is just called a [[matrix]]
	- Prerequisites: Start Learning Mathematics
		- Helpful for gathering basic knowledge of logical symbols, set operations, and maps
			- Working with maps will be important immediately
