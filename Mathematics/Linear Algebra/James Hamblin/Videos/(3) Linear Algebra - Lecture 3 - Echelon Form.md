- "Triangular Form"
	- Previously we discussed using row operations to put a matrix into "triangular form"
	- "Echelon form" makes this idea precise

- Echelon
	- "Echelon" is a military term that is used to describe a particular formation

- Echelon form of a matrix
	- To determine whether a matrix is in echelon form, we must look at the [[leading entry]] in each row
		- The leading entry of a row is simply the first non-zero entry as we go from left to right
		- A row with no non-zero entries has no leading entry
	- Consider this matrix

- Echelon form of a matrix
	- A matrix is in echelon form if it satisfies these three conditions:
		- (1) Any rows of all zeroes are below any other rows
		- (2) Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry in the row above it
		- (3) All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros
- The example above is not in echelon form as it does not satisfy all conditions (and in fact satisfies none of the conditions in this case)

	- This matrix is in echelon form

- Condition #3
	- If conditions #1 and #2 for echelon form are satisfied, then condition #3 is automatically satisfied
	- However, it's often useful to keep condition #3 in mind once we start talking about how to put a matrix into echelon form

- Reduced Echelon Form
	- While echelon form is the precise definition of the "triangular form" we discussed earlier, there is another form that is often useful
	- Reduced echelon form will make it even easier to determine the solution(s) for the corresponding system of linear equations

- Reduced Echelon Form
	- A matrix is in [[Reduced Row Echelon Form|reduced echelon form]] if it satisfies these conditions: ^5a33ff
		- (1) Any rows of all zeroes are below any other rows
		- (2) Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry in the row above it
		- (3) All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros
		- (4) The leading entry of each row is 1
		- (5) Each leading 1 is the only nonzero entry in its column
	- Note: Conditions 1 to 3 are all the same as regular echelon form. Reduced Echelon Form has 2 extra conditions of 4 and 5
		- Condition 5  overrides condition 3

- Reduced Echelon Form
	- Example/Practice
- This matrix is in reduced echelon form
	- The leading entry in the first row is a "1" and not a "-1".

- Uniqueness of Reduced Echelon Form
	- We can transform a given matrix, using row operations, into many different echelon forms
	- However, there is only one unique reduced echelon form for any given matrix

- What's next?
	- Next, we will learn how to use row operations in a methodical way to obtain an echelon form or a reduced echelon form for a matrix
	- Then, we will learn how to use the echelon (or reduced echelon form) to find solutions to the corresponding system of linear equations
