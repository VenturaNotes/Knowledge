- Solving a System: Elimination
	- Consider this system of equations
		- Each of the steps creates a new equation (which can make it difficult)
---
- Too many equations!
	- One down-side of the elimination method is that every step creates a new equation
	- We will focus on replacing an equation by the result of doing one of these operations
	- We will have to make sure that each operation is reversible so that we have not destroyed any information contained in the equations
		- Don't multiply both sides by 0
- Elimination Operations
	- Replace an equation by multiplying both sides by a non-zero constant
	- Replace an equation by the sum of itself and a multiple of another equation

- Elimination Operations
	- Replace an row by multiplying it by a non-zero constant
	- Replace an row by the sum of itself and a multiple of another row
	- Swap the positions of two rows
- No Solution because 0 $\ne$ 3
