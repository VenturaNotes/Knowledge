- Linear Equations
	- A [[linear equation]] is an equation that can be written in the form $$a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = b$$
	- The numbers $a_1$, ..., $a_n$ are called [[coefficients]]

- Examples
	- This is a linear equation
- If a variable is missing, the coefficient of that variable is 0
- Any kind of real number can be a coefficient in these linear equations

- Examples
	- This is not a linear equation
		- Can't have square root of a variable (not raised to any strange powers)
		- Not allowed to have variables being divided
		- Not allowed to have variables multiplied by each other

- Solving an equation
	- A solution to an equation is a value for each variable that makes the equation true
	- For example, x = 3, y = 4, and z = -5 is a solution to the equation x - 4y - 6z = 17
		- It may not be the only solution but it is at least one of the solutions

- System of Equations
	- A [[system of linear equations]] is a collection of one or more linear equations involving the same variables
	- For example

- System of Equations
	- A solution to a system of linear equations is a value for each variable that makes each equation true simultaneously
	- Solutions are often written as ordered tuples ($s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$), where $s_1$ is the value for $x_1, s_2$ is the value for $x_2$, and so on
	- An ordered n-tuple is a bunch of numbers separated by commas where there are "n" of those ($s_1, s_2, ..., s_n$) which is the generalization of the idea
		- (3,4) is an ordered pair
			- 3 is the value of the first variable
			- 4 is the value of the second variable
		- (-1, 0, 6) is an ordered triple
		- (2, 4, -1, 8) is an ordered quadruple

- Systems of Equations
	- For example, (-3, -8, 4) is not a solution to this system of equations
	- For example, (5, 6.5, 3) is a solution to this system of equations

- General Questions
	- (1) Given a system of linear equations, how can we tell whether the system has
		- no solutions
		- One (unique) solution
			- Unique is "one and only one" of something
		- Many solutions
	- (2) When a system has one or more solutions, how do we find them?
