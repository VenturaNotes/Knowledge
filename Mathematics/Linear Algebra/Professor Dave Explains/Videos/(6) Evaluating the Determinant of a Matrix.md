	- Finding the [[determinant]] of a square matrix
		- A square matrix is any matrix with an equivalent number of rows and columns
	- Determinant will be a scalar ad - bc
		- det(A) or Matrix: $\begin{vmatrix}a & b \\ c & d\end{vmatrix}$ = ad - bc
	- Finding the [[determinant of 2x2 matrix]]
	- Finding the [[determinant of 3x3 matrix]]
	- Finding the determinant of larger matrices
		- As matrices get bigger, finding the determinant requires many more steps
		- Make sure to alternate signs on these terms
		- We have to find these four determinants
		- Just stay organized and perform careful arithmetic
