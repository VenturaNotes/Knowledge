	- [[inverse function|Inverse Functions]]
	- [[Inverse Matrix]]
		- (1) a and d swap positions
		- (2) b and c switch their sign
		- (3) Divide by the determinant
	- There is no such thing as matrix division
	- [[Identity matrix]]
		- Confirms the inverse relationship
	- Utilizing inverse matrices
		- Solving equations with matrices (inverse matrices act as matrix division)
		- A matrix times its inverse yields an [[identity matrix]] (like cancelling out the matrix)
		- This is only possible if the two matrices have appropriate dimensions
		- Matrix multiplication is not commutative (place inverse matrix in same position on both sides)

	- Taking the inverse of a product of matrices $(BA)^{-1} = A^{-1}B^{-1}$ 
	- Not every matrix will have an inverse
		- If $\text{det}$(A) = 0 then: undefined so matrix won't have an inverse
			- This would be a [[singular matrix]]
	- Finding the inverse of a Three-by-Three matrix
		- Step 1: Generate the matrix of [[minors]]
			- each entry is a particular determinant
		- Step 2: Generate the matrix of [[Cofactor|cofactors]]
			- Corner and center entries will remain as they are
			- other four entires will have their signs inverted
			- follow the plus/minus checkerboard
		- Step 3: Find the Adjugate/[[adjoint]]
			- We must reflect entries across the main diagonal
			- transpose entries across the diagonal
		- Step 4: Divide Adjugate by determinant
			- Divide every entry in the adjugate by determinant of original matrix
		- Then you'll have the final answer for the inverse matrix
	- Find the inverse of larger matrices would require an incredible number of steps
		- We would use a matrix calculator more likely (to avoid doing pages of arithmetic)
