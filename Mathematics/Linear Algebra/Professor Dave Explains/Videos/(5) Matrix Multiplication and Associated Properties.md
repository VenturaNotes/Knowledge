	- [[Matrix addition]]
	- [[Matrix subtraction]]
	- [[Matrix multiplication]]
	- AB
		- For this multiplication to work, these matrices must have specific dimensions (not necessarily identical)
		- For this multiplication to work, A must have the same number of columns as B has rows
			- A = $m \times n$ 
			- B = $q \times p$
			- n must equal q
	- This is the algorithm we follow for matrix multiplication
	- Columns in A must equal rows in B
	- Product will always have the # of rows as A and the # of columns as B
	- number multiplication is commutative
		- ab = ba
	- matrix multiplication is NOT commutative
		- AB $\ne$ BA
	- Matrix multiplication is associative
		- (AB)C = A(BC)
	- Matrix multiplication can be distributive
		- If A and B are $m \times n$ matrices and C and D are $n \times p$ matrices
			- A(C + D) = AC + AD and (A+B)C = AC + BC
