	- Linear algebra is all about linear equations. Linear equations have a lot of real world applications since so many things have linear relationships
		- Science, engineering, economics
	- y=mx +b
	- Why are linear equations so common?
		- Linear equations embody a happy medium of simplicity and complexity
			- Having a constant value is unlikely to solve too many problems in the real world
			- Functions of higher degrees can make things tricky
	- Systems of linear equations
	- [[Linear equation]]
		- $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + a_3x_3 + ... + a_nx_n = b$
			- can contain any number of terms
			- the sum of the terms equals a constant
			- "a" terms are coefficients
			- "x" terms are different variables
				- None of the variables are raised to an exponent
			- No roots, trig functions, etc.
			- The variables are not involved in products or quotients with each other

	- Systems of linear equations get complicated because we can have many equations
	- three variables means a solution with three values
	- Will start with two equations and two unknowns
		- The intersection of the lines is the solution to the system
	- These three systems all involve two variables and thus two dimensions
		- Parallel lines means no solution
			- [[inconsistent]] when no solution
		- Same line means infinite solutions
			- [[consistent]] when there is a solution
		- Lines intersect
			- One solution
			- [[consistent]] when there is a solution
	- three variables means three dimensions
		- each equation could be a plane
		- the point of intersection is the solution
			- Possible solutions are a point, a line, or a plane
				- line and plane would yield infinitely many solutions
			- No solution possible as well if you have 3 parallel planes
	- We've run out of dimensions to represent 4 equations and 4 variables adequately
	- We will have to learn all about [[matrix notation]]
