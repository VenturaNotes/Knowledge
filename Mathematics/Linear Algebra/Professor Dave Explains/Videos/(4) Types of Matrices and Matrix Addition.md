	- [[Matrix]]
		- Arrays of numbers that are often meant to represent coefficients and constants form a system of linear equations
	- We can manipulate matrices in order to solve the system
	- m = number of rows
	- n = number of columns
	- when m = n, the matrix is a [[square matrix]]
		- Entries going from top left to bottom right comprise the [[main diagonal]] of the matrix
	- [[Diagonal matrix]] (also called an [[identity matrix]])
		- All the entries off the main diagonal are zero
			- This is what we're trying to get when performing Gauss-Jordan elimination
	- [[upper triangular matrix]]
		- Entries below the main diagonal are all zero
	- [[lower triangular matrix]]
		- entries above the main diagonal are all zero
	- [[Vector]]
		- Matrix consisting of just one column
		- The more common usage of "vector"
	- [[Row Vector]]
		- Matrix consisting of just one row
	- Vector
		- We can list systems solutions as a vector

	- Systems of linear equations can be represented with vectors
	- [[Vector form]] of the linear system
	- When multiplying a matrix by a scalar, we multiply each entry by the [[scalar]]
		- Works regardless the dimensions of the matrix
	- [[Matrix Addition]]
	- For matrices to be added together, they must have identical dimensions (same number of rows and columns)
		- Each entry in the new matrix is the sum of the corresponding entries
	- [[Matrix subtraction]] is very similar to matrix addition
		- Not commutative
			- A - B $\ne$ B - A
	- [[Matrix addition]] is commutative A + B = B + A
