	- [[Matrix notation]]
	- Understanding Matrices and Matrix Notation
		- These numbers represent the relevant information
	- [[Matrix]]
		- An array of numbers contained in brackets. It has rows and columns of numbers. We can insert a number of rows and columns that will allow us to express the coefficients in the linear system
	- [[Coefficient matrix]]
	- [[Augmented matrix]]
	- We need all the equations in the same form
	- Missing variables need a coefficient of zero
	- A system with m equations and n variables (x, y, z) will give us an $m \times n$ coefficient matrix
	- Construct an augmented matrix from the following equations
