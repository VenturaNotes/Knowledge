	- To express vector spaces in the most efficient way
		- We need the fewest number of elements that can be used to write any other elements in the space
			- We want to avoid unnecessary information
	- Understanding [[linear independence]]
		- Linear combination of these vectors
		- Because $\vec{c}$ can be written in terms of $\vec{a}$ and $\vec{b}$ we would refer to these vectors as [[Linear Dependence|linearly dependent]]
		- If none of the vectors can be written in terms of the others, then they are [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]]
	- $\vec{v_1}, \vec{v_2}, ... \vec{v_n}$ in vector space V
		- For linear independence, this equation will require that all scalars equal zero
			- $c_1\vec{v_1} + c_2\vec{v_2} + ... c_n\vec{v_n} = \vec{0}$
				- By manipulating the equation this way $c_2\vec{v_2} + ... c_n\vec{v_n} = -c_1\vec{v_1}$
					- We can see that the element could be expressed in terms of all the others if any of the coefficients were nonzero. However, if they are all 0 $(0 = -c\vec{v_1}$), then the left side simplifies to 0. For the equation to be satisfied,
