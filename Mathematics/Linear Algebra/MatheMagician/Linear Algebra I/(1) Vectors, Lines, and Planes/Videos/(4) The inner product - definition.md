	- The [[inner product]]
		- Multiplying vectors
	- Can only compute inner product if vectors have the same length
	- Inner product also sometimes called the dot product or scalar product
		- Sometimes called a scalar product because we get out a scalar when doing the dot product
	- There will be an other product between vectors which will not have a scalar/dot
	- $a\cdot c$ not defined
	- Properties
		- $u \cdot v = v \cdot u$
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">u and v are vectors here</mark>
			- This is because it's just a product of 2 scalars
		- $c(u\cdot v) = (cu) \cdot v$ 
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">u and v are vectors, c is a scalar</mark>
			- It doesn't matter if you take the inner product first and then multiply with c or vice versa
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">For real inner products, going further to complex numbers you need to be more careful</mark>
		- Similarly: $(u + v)w = uw + vw$
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">u, v, and w are vectors</mark>
