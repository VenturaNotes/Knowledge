	- Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ 
		- Can create vectors with any number of components
	- Unable to draw figures with 4 axes
		- To represent high dimensions, don't do x, y, z. We are at the end of the alphabet. Instead, potentially represent them as $x_1, x_2$, etc...
	- To show we have a vector with n-components
		- $u \in \mathbb{R}^n \implies u = \begin{bmatrix}u_1 \\ \vdots \\ u_n \end{bmatrix}$ 
	- For vector a from origin to point P, [[point]] P has components ($a_1, a_2$)
		- The vector starting at origin goin towards p is components $a_1, a_2$ 
		- In many applications, the point P (which is a point in the [[plane]]) and the vector are used interchangeably
			- Sometimes people use a vector to denote a point and vice versa
