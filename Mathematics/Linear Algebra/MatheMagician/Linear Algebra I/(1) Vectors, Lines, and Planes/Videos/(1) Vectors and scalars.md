	- [[Vectors]] and [[Scalars]]
		- To describe a pool table may need
			- mass m (kg)
				- Just a number
			- Volume V ($m^3$)
				- Just a number cubed
			- time t (s)
				- Just a number
	- What if we want to describe position of ball?
		- Can't just give a number (need vectors for this)
			- Need to choose [[origin]]
			- Must choose a [[Coordinate Plane|coordinate system]] (can do x-axis and y-axis)
			- Need to choose some unit (some scale)
		- The position of the ball is described by vectors consisting of 2 components (x and y which tells us where the ball is)
		- Will use boldface to represent [[vectors]] and normal for [[scalar]] quantities
	- Vector quantities have both size (magnitude) and direction
		- How far we're traveling but direction of travel as well
		- Scalars only have magnitude
	- For [[vectors]]
		- position **r** (m)
		- velocity **v** (m/s)
			- Time rate of change of position
			- derivative of position with respect to time
		- acceleration **a** $(m/s^2)$
			- How fast velocity is changing
			- How fast it's accelerating
		- force **F** (N)
			- F = ma
				- mass is a [[scalar]] quantity
				- acceleration is a vector quantity
				- mass $\times$ acceleration = vector quantity
	- When do we call two vectors the same?
		- In the first graph (top-right), 
			- vector $v_1$ is in the same direction as vector $u$ but does not have the same size
				- $v_1 \ne u$ 
			- $v_2$ same magnitude as $u$ but in another direction
				- $v_2 \ne u$ 
			- $v_3 \ne u$
		- In the second graph (top-right), $u = v$ because they have the same magnitude and direction even though they don't have the same starting point
		- In linear algebra, will mostly use start at the origin
	- In physics, needs to be more careful
		- It does matter where you apply the force to an object
		- In a physical problem, will always need to be careful where you're moving vectors around
			- In pool table, apart from [[linear momentum]], you also have [[angular momentum]]
			- In physics, be careful when vectors are equal or not
			- In linear algebra, we'll have all vectors starting at the origin
