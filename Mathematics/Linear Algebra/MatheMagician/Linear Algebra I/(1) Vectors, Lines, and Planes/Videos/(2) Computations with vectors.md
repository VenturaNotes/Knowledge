	- [[Vector algebra]]
	- Will learn how to add vectors and multiply them with a scalar
		- Could use a geometric point of view
			- Form a parallelogram in geometric (take tail of b and put it to had of a)
			- Can view vectors as [[displacements]]
				- physics behind the way how we add the vectors
				- Same holds for velocities and acceleration
		- or an algebraic point of view
		- Both viewpoints give exactly the same result
	- [[Scalar multiplication]]
		- Go in the same direction but twice as far if scalar is 2
		- For negatives, go opposite of direction
	- Algebraically. Add components of vectors together. Or multiply each component of vector by the scalar
