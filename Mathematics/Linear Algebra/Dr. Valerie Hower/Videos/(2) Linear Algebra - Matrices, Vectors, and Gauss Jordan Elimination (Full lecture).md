	- We can store all information of a linear system into a [[matrix]]
		- A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers
		- Always list the rows first and then the columns. $3 \times 4$ matrix
		- Generally: m $\times$ n matrix has m rows and n columns
	- [[augmented matrix]]
		- Has all of the information of the linear system
		- Usually dotted bar used to show this
	- [[Coefficient matrix]]

	- A m$\times$n matrix
	- $a_{ij}$ is an (i,j) entry of row i and column j
	- 0 [[zero matrix]]
	- Two matrices are equal provided both m$\times$n and $a_{ij}=b_{ij}$ for all i,j
		- Only way two matrices are equal is when every single entry is equal

	- Some Definitions for $n\times n$ [[square matrix]]
		- Has same number of rows as columns
	- A square matrix A is
		- [[diagonal]] provided $a_{ij} = 0$ for $i\ne$ j
			- $a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33}, ..., a_{nn}$ are diagonal entries
		- [[upper triangular]] provided $a_{ij} = 0$ for i > j
		- [[lower triangular]] provided $a_{ij} = 0$ for i < j
	- The [[Identity Matrix|identity matrix]]
		- the $n\times n$ diagonal matrix with $a_{ii}$ = 1 for all i
- Image
	- Columns of an m$\times$n matrix are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^m$
	- A vector in $\mathbb{R}^5$ would have 5 rows
	- [[Vector]] in $\mathbb{R}^2$ 
		- Arrow starting at origin and ends at given point
			- This viewpoint is a standard representation of a vector ([[standard position]])
	- We think about vectors as columns
