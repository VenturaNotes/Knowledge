	- Matrix operations (sums and scalar multiples)
	- Some terminology (hopefully review)
		- [[Address]]
			- If we have matrix A and want to specify the location of the "7", we want to know directions on how to get there. In linear algebra, we call that the address
			- $a_{ij}$
				- lowercase a denotes that it is in matrix A
				- Then two subscripts
					- i = row / position
					- j = column or vector
				- $i^{th}$ term of $j^{th}$ vector
					- The way it's said in textbook
					- Fancier linear algebra way of saying it
		- [[Diagonal entry|Diagonal entries]]
			- These are the entries $a_{11}, a_{22}, a_{33}$
				- Don't really talk about diagonal entries unless dealing with [[square matrix]]
					- Obviously square matrix refers to a matrix that has the same number of rows as columns. It's $n \times n$ as opposed to $n \times m$ 
					- Square matrix has the same number of rows and columns
					- B is a square matrix in this example
						- It has a diagonal
						- When talking about diagonals of a matrix, always talking about the diagonal from top left to bottom right
		- [[Diagonal matrix]]
			- A square matrix where all the non-diagonal entries are zeros
			- Matrix B would be considered a diagonal matrix (even if the diagonal is not all 1s)
		- [[Identity matrix]]
			- Where we have a diagonal of all 1s, and anything not in diagonal is all zeros 
			- Identity matrix for 5x5 square matrix shown ($I_5$)
				- Identity matrix is denoted with an $I$ and the subscript, how many entries, rows and columns, there are
		- [[Zero matrix]]
			- matrix with all zeros. Denoted with a 0
	- Matrix Sums
		- Just as we did with vectors, this is done component-wise. Therefore, matrices can only be added if they have the same dimensions.
			- Component-wise just means taking the first entry of both and summing them together. Then taking the second entry of both and so on.
				- A + B = B + A so commutativity applies here
			- C is a column vector ($2 \times 1$)
			- Addition is component-wise
	- Scalar Multiples
		- Given $rA$, r is the scalar and A is the matrix.
	- Properties (Theorem 1 in textbook)
		- $A + B = B + A$
			- [[Commutative property of addition]]
		- $(A + B) + C = A + (B + C)$
			- [[Associative property of addition]]
		- $A + 0 = A$
			- [[Additive identity]]
			- Adding the zero matrix to any matrix will end you back where you started
		- $r(A + B) = rA + rB$
			- [[Distributive property]]
		- $(r + s) A = rA + sA$
			- Distributive property (can go either direction here)
		- $r(sA) = (rs)A$
			- [[Associative property of multiplication]]
				- Can multiply the other order
		- Properties similar to when you took algebra 1 the first time
		- These are matrices A, B, and C, and then scalars, r and s

	- Practice
		- Dealing with scalar multiples and matrix addition
		- (1)
			- Scalar will not change matrix dimensions
		- (2)
			- Can add or subtract matrices (or could just multiple the entries by the negative so the matrices could add instead of subtracting)
		- (3)
			- Not valid as dimensions are not the same
