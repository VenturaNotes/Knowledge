	- The [[matrix equation]] Ax = b
	- Linear Combinations as the product of a matrix and vector
		- If A is an $m \times n$ matrix with columns $a_1, a_2, ..., a_n$ and if $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, then Ax is the linear combination of the columns of A using the corresponding entries in x as weights: (see image)
		- Matrix must have same number of columns as the vector has rows. The vector elements will be used as weights
	- Examples
		- (1) Find Ax
		- (2) Write the linear combination as a matrix times a vector
			- Vector used as weights here
	- The same - but different (all same representations for systems of equations)
		- System of equations
		- Augmented Matrix
			- Textbook doesn't show line between coefficients and solutions but professor would like this
		- Vector Equation
			- Uses $x_1$ as the weights multiplied by vectors
		- Matrix Equation
			- A will be the [[coefficient matrix]]
			- x will be the vector
			- right side of = is the solutions
	- Existence of Solutions
		- Let A be an $m \times n$ matrix. Then these statements are logically equivalent:
			- (1) For each b in $\mathbb{R}^m$, the equation $Ax = b$ has a solution
				- This means there is a solution for every b
			- (2) Each b in $\mathbb{R}^m$ is a linear combination of the columns of A
			- (3) The columns of A span $\mathbb{R}^m$ 
			- (4) A has a pivot position in every row (A must be a coefficient matrix - not augmented)

	- Let A = matrix and b = vector. Is the equation Ax = b consistent for all possible b?
		- This is inconsistent as 0 = $b_1 - \frac 12 b_2 + b_3$ which means it's not for all possible values of b. There are values that will make the expression not equal to 0
			- #question Does this just mean a free variable is needed?
