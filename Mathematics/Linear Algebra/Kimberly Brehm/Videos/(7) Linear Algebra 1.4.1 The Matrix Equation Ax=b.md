- Linear combinations as the product of a matrix and vector
	- If A is an $m$ x $n$ matrix with columns $a_i, a_2, ..., a_n$ and if $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$, then $A_x$ is the linear combination of the columns of A using the corresponding entries in $x$ as weights:

		- We have Matrix A
		- The dimensions of A is 1 x n.
		- Will multiply by the vector n x 1
			- Vector will just be 1 column
				- But needs to have the same number of rows as a has columns (this is what's meant by corresponding entries)
			- Will use $x_1$ as weights and multiply it by everything in whichever column that corresponds to the subscript of 1, 2, etc.
- Examples

		- For the $2^{nd}$ part, it's shown as a vector times a matrix
- The same - But Different (all of the representations below are for the exact same system of equations)
	- System of Equations:
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-08 at 3.53.52 PM.png]]
			- 3 variables. Can be written as an augmented matrix
	- Augmented Matrix
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-08 at 3.54.08 PM.png]]
			- Left side is the coefficients and right side is solutions/answers
			- Textbook does not show line (pipe) but professor wants you to show it anyway
			- Can be written as vector equation
	- Vector Equation: $x_1\vec{a}_1 + x_2\vec{a}_2 + ... + x_n\vec{a}_n = b$

			- Uses x1, x2, x3 as the weights times the vectors
	- Matrix Equation: Ax = b
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-08 at 3.54.35 PM.png]]
			- A will be the coefficient matrix (everything in the augmented matrix on the left side) multiplied by the vector (which are the variables) which give the solution $\begin {bmatrix} 3\\ 4\end{bmatrix}$
- Existence of solutions
	- Let A be an mxn matrix. Then these statements are logically equivalent:
		- 1) for each b in $\mathbb{R}^m$, the equations Ax = b has a solution
			- There is a solution for every b
		- 2) Each b in $\mathbb{R}^m$ is a linear combination of the columns of A
			- $x_1a_1 + x_2a_2 + ... = b$ 
				- Order may have been mixed up here
				- It's saying each one of those has a solution
		- 3) The columns of A span $\mathbb{R}^m$
			- span is the collection of all the solutions. Columns of A span are m
		- 4) A has a pivot position in every row (A must be a coefficient matrix - not augmented)
			- Not in an augmented matrix because if pivot on right side (in solutions) and numbers to the left are 0, that would mean no solution

- Practice

	- Inconsistent because it's not for all possible values of b. There are values that will make the $a_{4,4}$ expression not equal to 0.
		- I wonder if there is a reason for this
