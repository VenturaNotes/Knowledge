	- Playlist followed by "Linear algebra and its applications by David Lay"
	- Wanted to talk about the computation of $Ax$ 
		- More of the normal way that we would multiply matrices
	- Example Revisited
		- Find Ax
		- Previously
		- Row-Vector Rule for computing Ax
			- If Ax is defined, the $i^{th}$ entry in $A_x$ is the sum of the products of corresponding entries from row i of A and from the vector x
