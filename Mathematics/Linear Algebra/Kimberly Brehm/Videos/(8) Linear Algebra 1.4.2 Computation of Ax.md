	- Playlist followed by "Linear algebra and its applications by David Lay"
	- Wanted to talk about the computation of $Ax$ 
		- More of the normal way that we would multiply matrices
	- Example Revisited
		- Find Ax
			- Used vector as scalars
		- Previously
		- Row-Vector Rule for computing Ax
			- If Ax is defined, the $i^{th}$ entry in $A_x$ is the sum of the products of corresponding entries from row i of A and from the vector x
	- Practice
		- Given a matrix and 2 vectors, find the following expressions
		- Will do proof to show both values are equivalent
			- One of the properties is that $A(\vec u + \vec v$) is equivalent to $A\vec u + A \vec v$ 
				- #question is there a sign for equivalence?
	- Practice 2
		- Doing example that the two expressions are equivalent
			- $A(c\vec u)$ is equivalent to $c(A\vec u)$ 
			- We have a matrix A, vector $\vec u$, and scalar c
		- Proof can be found in textbook
