	- Row-Vector Rule for computing $A_x$
		- If $A_x$ is defined, the $i^{th}$ entry in $A_x$ is the sum of the products of corresponding entries from row i of A and from vector x
			- All this is saying is it'll take the top row of A and multiply it by column to get solution of 1. Then take bottom row and multiply it by column to get solution of 17

	- Shown an example that this is true. Not a proof but shows that one of the properties for those two expressions are equivalent
