	- Row Reduction and Echelon Forms
		- Started to work with row operations and matrices
	- [[Echelon Form]] vs. [[Reduced Row Echelon Form]] (RREF)
		- Echelon: (Previously called triangle form)
		- (1) All non-zero rows are above all zero rows
		- (2) Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it
		- (3) All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeros
		- RREF - ALL conditions above and!
		- (4) The leading entry in each non-zero row is 1
		- (5) Each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in the column
