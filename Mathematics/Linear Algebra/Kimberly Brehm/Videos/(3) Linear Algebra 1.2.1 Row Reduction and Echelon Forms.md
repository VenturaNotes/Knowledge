	- [[Echelon Form]] Vs. [[Reduced Row Echelon Form]] (RREF)
		- REF is reduced echelon form
		- Echelon : (previously called triangle form)
			- 1) All Non-zero rows are above all zero rows
			- 2) Each leading entry of a row is in a column to the right of the leading entry of the row above it.
				- The circled numbers are leading entries 
			- 3) All entries in a column below a leading entry are zeroes.
			- RREF - All conditions above and: (example in purple)
				- 4) The leading entry in each non-zero Rows 1
				- 5) Each leading 1 is the only non-zero entry in the column
	- [[Pivot]]!
		- [[Pivot Position]] - Corresponds to leading 1 in RREF (RED)
			- The 2 would be a pivot position
		- [[Pivot Column]] - The column that contains the pivot (GREEN)
		- [[Pivot]] - Nonzero number in pivot position used to create zeroes in row operations (BLUE)

	- [[The Row Reduction Algorithm]]
		- (1) Begin at leftmost nonzero column, which is a pivot column. Select a nonzero entry as pivot and interchange. If necessary to move that entry into the pivot position (Row 1).
		- (2) Use row operations to create zeros in all entries below the pivot
		- (3) Repeat this process for remaining rows, ignoring rows you've already applied algorithm to.
			- Ignore the green matrix on the light green matrix.
			- For it to be RREF, you need to have the numbers above the 1 be 0s.
		- (4) Ensure each pivot is a 1, using scaling as necessary
			- The first 3 steps were wrapped with step 4
		- (5) Beginning with the rightmost pivot and working upwards and to the left, use row operations to create zeros above each pivot
