- Vectors in $\mathbb{R^2}$ 
	- Vector - An ordered list of numbers (more on this in chapter 4)
	- Column Vector - A vector with only one column. We often use these for ordered pairs, triplets, etc.
	- Vectors in  $\mathbb{R^2}$  - The set of all vectors with 2 entries. $\mathbb{R}$ $\rightarrow$ real numbers 2 $\rightarrow$ number of entries this is the set of all points in a plane.
		- Set of real numbers in 2 entries
		- Example: (1,3) $\rightarrow$ $\begin {bmatrix} 1\\ 3\end{bmatrix}$
	- Operations with vectors - Same as with other matrices. 
		- Scalar - Multiply vector by a constant

		- Addition - Add corresponding values
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-07 at 5.44.09 AM.png]]
		- Multiplication - Nope! Dimensions Don't work.
			- Would need 1 row in other vector for a 2 x 1 to multiply

	- If $\vec{u}$ = $\begin {bmatrix} 2\\ 3\end{bmatrix}$ and $\vec{v}$ = $\begin {bmatrix} -1\\ 2\end{bmatrix}$, Find $\vec{u} + \vec{v}$ and $-2\vec{u} + 4\vec{v}$.

	- Parallelogram rule for addition
		- 4th point of parallelogram made up by point (0,0) or just called 0 vector
		- Purple vector is  $\vec{u} + \vec{v}$ 
	- Write a half arrow above $u$ to represent vector
	- Green arrow down left is -2$\vec{u}$ and blue arrow up left is $4\vec{v}$ 
- Vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ ^4db6fb
	- If n $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$, Then $\mathbb{R}^n$ is the collection of all lists of ordered n-tuples of N real numbers written as N x 1 column matrices
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-07 at 5.54.52 AM.png]]
		- n can be any real number
	- Zero Vector - The vector whose entries are all 0, denoted by 0.

- Algebraic properties of $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- These properties correspond to properties of real numbers and pertain to vectors u, v and w and scalars c and d.

			- Commutative Property - saying that you can add vectors in either order and the result will be the same
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-07 at 6.02.30 AM.png]]
			- Associative Property - Can group vectors differently and the result will be the same
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-07 at 6.03.14 AM.png]]
			- Additive Identity Property - Add 0 to any vector and end up with that vector meaning that the identity is 0
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-07 at 6.04.06 AM.png]]
			- Inverse property - Add the inverse (negative vector) and you will end up back at the identity of 0
		- Below deals with scalars (any value that you multiply by a vector)
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-07 at 6.06.20 AM.png]]
			- Distributive Property - if you have a scalar add two vectors first and then multiply by the scalar or multiply each vector by the scalar and add the results together.
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-08 at 3.47.58 AM.png]]
			- Distributive Property (two scalars) - Add scalars together and then multiply by the vector or separate each scalar out and then multiply each by the vector and then add the results together
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-08 at 3.50.19 AM.png]]
			- Multiplying instead of adding. $c*d$ which are both scalars $*\vec{u}$ which is a vector
				- So you can either multiply one scalar times a vector and then multiply by other scalar or multiply two scalars together first 
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-08 at 3.52.10 AM.png]]
			- Identity property for multiplication - if you take something times 1, you will end up at the same vector
- Practice
