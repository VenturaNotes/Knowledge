- Linear Combinations
	- The vector defined by $y = c_1v_1 + c_2v_2 + ... + c_nv_n$ where $c_i$ are scalars and $v_i$ are vectors, is called a linear combination of $\vec{v}_i,\vec{v}_2..., \vec{v}_n$ with weights $\vec{c}_i,\vec{c}_2..., \vec{c}_n$.

- Some clarification
	- A vector equation $x_1\vec{a}_1 +x_2\vec{a}_2 + ... + x_n\vec{a}_n = \vec{b}$ has the same solution set as the linear system whose augmented matrix is $[\vec{a}_1, \vec{a}_2...\vec{a}_n|\vec{b}]$. Therefore, a vector equation only has a solution if the system is consistent
		- The first equation represents the sum of all vectors multiplied by their scalars above are vectors multiplied by some scalars
	- If $\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2...\vec{v}_p$  are in $\mathbb{R}^n$, then the set of linear combinations is denoted span{$\vec{v}_1,\vec{v}_2...\vec{v}_p$ } and is called the subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ spanned. Essentially span{$\vec{v}_1,...\vec{v}_p$ } is all vectors that can be written in the form {$c_1\vec{v}_1 + c_2\vec{v}_2 + ... + c_p\vec{v}_p = b$} with $c_i$ scalars.
		- span is the collection of all the solutions to those linear combinations ^33f26d
			- All of the scalars combined with all of those vectors that are solutions

	- Span means you can write it as an augmented matrix
