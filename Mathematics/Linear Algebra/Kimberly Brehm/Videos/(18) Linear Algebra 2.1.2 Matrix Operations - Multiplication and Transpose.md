	- [[Matrix operations]] (multiplication and [[transpose]])
	- [[Matrix multiplication]]
		- If A is an $m \times n$ matrix and if B is an $n \times p$ matrix with columns $b_1, b_2 ... b_p$, then the product AB is the $m \times p$ matrix whose columns are $Ab_1, Ab_2 ... Ab_p$ that is $AB = A[b_1 b_2... b_p] = [Ab_1 Ab_2 ... Ab_p]$ 
			- This is the formal definition from text
			- "n" much match with "n"
			- Resulting matrix will be $m \times p$ 
			- b is made up of columns similar to vectors. We're taking A and multiplying it by each of the vectors which gives the result
	- Example
		- Showing how to multiply two matrices
	- [[Row Column Rule]]
		- If the product AB is defined, then the entry in row i and column j of AB is the sum of the products in the corresponding entries from row i of A and column j of B.
			- $(AB)_{ij} = a_{i1}b_{1j} + a_{i2}b_{2j} + ... + a_{in}b_{nj}$ 
			- AB is the product vector
	- Practice
		- Compute AB by the definition and the row-column rule

	- More properties (theorem 2 in text)
		- $A(BC) = (AB)C$
			- First one requires proof and textbook goes through it
			- [[Associative property of multiplication]]
		- $A(B + C) = AB + BC$
			- [[Distributive property]]
		- $(B + C)A = BA + CA$
			- [[Distributive property]]
		- $r(AB) = (rA)B = A(rB)$
			- No name
			- scalar
		- $I_mA = AI_n = A$ 
			- [[Identity property]]
			- Using the `m` and `n` subscripts to let us know we can multiply
			- The [[identity matrix]] is a [[diagonal matrix]] with 1s in diagonal and zeros everywhere else
	- Warning!
		- In general, AB $\ne$ BA
			- Powers of a matrix
				- #question what does this mean?
			- Example shown in image
		- If AB = AC, it is not required that B = C
			- Exercise 10 is a good example of this in textbook
		- If AB = 0, you cannot conclude A = 0 or B= 0
			- Can see exercise 12 for an example of this in textbook
	- [[Transpose]] of a matrix
		- Given an $M \times N$ matrix A, the transpose, denoted $A^T$, is an $N \times M$ matrix whose columns are formed by the rows of A
	- Properties of Transpose (not showing proofs but shows how they're valid properties through examples)
		- $(A^T)^T = A$
		- $(A + B)^T = A^T + B^T$
		- $(rA)^T=r(A^T)$
			- r is a scalar, A is a matrix
		- $(AB)^T=B^TA^T$
