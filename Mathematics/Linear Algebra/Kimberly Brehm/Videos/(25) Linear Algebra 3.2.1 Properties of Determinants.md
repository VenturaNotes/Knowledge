	- Properties of [[determinants]]
		- Proofs will be in textbook but not in video
	- Back to row operations
		- Let A, and det A
		- [[Interchange]] / swap (real name is interchange but can say "swap" as well)
			- det B = - det A
		- [[Scaling]]
			- det B = c det A
				- c is your scalar in row operation
		- [[Replacement]]
			- det B = det A
				- Won't change determinant
	- An example
		- Could find determinant of matrix using cofactor expansion
			- Trying to get this into [[triangular form]]
			- We when we find the triangular form (which will be a reduction of matrix A in this case), because we've reduced it to triangular form we have a theorem that says:
				- If you can get it down to triangular form, then the determinant is the product of the diagonal
			- This is how we can use properties of the determinant to find the determinant of a 3x3 matrix without using cofactor expansion
	- An example
		- Using scale this time
			- Need to multiply by [[reciprocal]] for new matrix
				- So if $det B = \frac 12 det A$, then 
					- $2 det B = det A$ 
		- Goal to get to triangular form

	- Practice
		- Can use cofactor expansion, row operations, mixture of both of them to find the determinant for this problem
		- Solution is 0 for this problem
	- Two more properties (these require proofs which are in textbook)
		- (1) If A is an $n \times n$ matrix, then $det A^T = det A$
		- (2) If A and B are $n \times n$ matrices, then `det` $AB = det A * det B$
