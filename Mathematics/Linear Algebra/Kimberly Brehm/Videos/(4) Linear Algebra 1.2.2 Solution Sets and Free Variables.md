- Consistent System with infinitely many solutions

	- 0 is allowed to equal 0
- Free variables can take an any value. Once you choose a value for your free variable, it will determine the values of the other (basic) variables

	- $x_3$ can be any value and you'll always find a varying set of solutions
- Find the general solution to the system

- Practice
	- Find the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">general solution</mark> of the augmented matrix

		- If it's inconsistent, just say inconsistent
		- If consistent with 1 solution, give the 1 solution
		- If consistent with infinitely many solutions, if a variable is free, say it's free
			- if neither, write it as a relationship to the variables that are free
			- General solution must be written with bracket
			- Since column 1 and column 3 had pivots, they are not free variables. Because column 2 doesn't have a pivot, it's a free variable
