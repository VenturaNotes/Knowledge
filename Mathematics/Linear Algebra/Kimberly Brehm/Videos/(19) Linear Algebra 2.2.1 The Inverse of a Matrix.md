	- The [[inverse]] of a matrix
	- Inverses and identities
		- Algebraic: $3*1 = 3$, $3 (\frac 13) = 1$
			- 1 is called the [[multiplicative identity]]
				- We can take any value times 1 and get back that value.
			- An [[inverse]] is a value you would multiply by your original value to get back to [[identity]]. 1 is the identity in the second example and $\frac 13$ is the inverse for the second example
		- In Matrices: 
			- $AI_n = A$
				- A multiplied by inverse matrix should get back to A
				- The subscript for the inverse ($I$) just tells the number of rows or columns (as it will be a square matrix)
			- $I_nA = A$
			- $AA^{-1} = I_n$
			- $A^{-1}A = I_n$
		- The [[inverse matrix]] is a [[square matrix]] with 1s in diagonal
		- Let A. If ad - bc $\ne$ 0, A is [[invertible]]
			- Helps for a 2x2 matrix
			- The value $ad-bc$ is called the [[determinant]] of A or $det \space A = ad-bc$
	- The inverse of a 2x2 matrix (theorem 4 in text)
		- Let A =  $\begin{bmatrix}a & b\\ c & d\end{bmatrix}$. If ad-bc $\ne$ 0, then A is invertible and $A^{-1} = \frac{1}{ad-bc} \begin{bmatrix}d & -b\\ -c & a\end{bmatrix}$. If $ad-bc = 0$, A is not invertible
			- Switch first diagonal and then make b and c are negatives.
		- Not a proof but shows it will give identity for $AA^{-1}$ 
	- Practice
		- Find the inverse of A and verify it is the inverse
	- Practice
		- Find $A^{-1}$ for A
		- Not able to find inverse here because the determinant is zero
