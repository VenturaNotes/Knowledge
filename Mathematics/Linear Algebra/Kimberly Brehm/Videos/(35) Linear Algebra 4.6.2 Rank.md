	- Will learn about [[rank]] and rank theorem
	- What is it?
		- Rank A = dim Col A = # pivot columns in A 
			- Rank is simply the dimension of the column space of A which is simply the number of pivot columns in A
			- Just need to reduce matrix to at least echelon form
			- We have rank 3 because that is the number of pivot columns in A
	- The [[rank theorem]]
		- Rank A = dim Row A for A, an $m \times n$ matrix (where n is number of columns)
			- Every pivot needs to have a row 
			- Therefore, it makes sense that every time I have a pivot column, I will also have a non-zero row which adds to the dimensions of the row space of A 
		- Rank A + dim Nul A = n
			- The # of pivot columns + the number of free variables = # of columns in matrix
	- Practice
		- If A is a $7 \times 10$ matrix with a 3-dimensional null space, what is the rank of A?
			- Rank of A + dimension of null space of A = number of columns in matrix
				- Rank A + 3 = 10
				- Rank A = 7
		- Could a $4 \times 7$ matrix have a 2-dimensional null space?
			- Can you have a 2-dimensional null space with a rank of 5?
			- Keep in mind that the columns are vectors in $\mathbb{R}^4$. So could we have 5? No because the number of rows is 4 and 5 cannot exceed 4.
			- No
				- 3-dimensional null space would be okay as you'd have 4 + 3 = 7
	- More [[invertible matrix theorem|IMT]]
		- Let A be an invertible $n \times n$ matrix. The following statements are equivalent:
			- The columns of A form a basis of $\mathbb{R}^n$
			- Col A = $\mathbb{R}^n$
			- dim Col A = n
			- Rank A = n
			- Nul A = {0}
			- dim Nul A = 0
