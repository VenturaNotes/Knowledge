	- Applications of linear systems: [[Network flow]]
	- Find the general flow pattern of the network shown. Assuming all values are non-negative, what is the largest possible $x_3$ value?
		- Once you have a [[pivot]], everything above and below needs to be zero
			- #comment conditional only to [[Reduced Row Echelon Form|RREF]] I believe
		- $x_3$ is a free variable here
		- The general flow pattern is the same as the [[general solution]] here.
		- The largest possible $x_3$ value is 20 because 20-20 is 0 and anything greater than 20 would be $x_1$ negative
		- Didn't write general solution in [[parametric form]] and that's okay.
			- 20 is the greatest $x_3$ (just answers second part of question)
