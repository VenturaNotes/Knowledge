	- Introduction to [[determinants]]
	- What is it?
		- We already know that if `det` A $\ne$ 0, then A is an invertible matrix
		- We also know that if A, then `det` A = ad - bc
		- Let's change the notation a bit:
			- Ex. Find `det` A if A = (in picture)
		- What we don't know is how to compute `det` A if A is a 3x3, 4x4, .... `nxn` matrix $\forall n \ge 3, n \in \mathbb{N}$ 
	- The definition
		- For n $\ge$ 2, the determinant of an $n \times n$ matrix A = $[a_{ij}]$ is the sum of n terms of the form $\pm a_{1j}detA_{1j}$, with +/- alternating, where $a_{11}, a_{12}... a_{1n}$ are the first row entries of A.
			- Formula shown here
		- $A_{ij}$ is a [[submatrix]] of A formed by deleting the $i^{th}$ row and the $j^{th}$ column
	- Practice
		- Find det A for A
		- Can use straight brackets to let others know you're finding the determinant as opposed to writing out `det` and then matrix
