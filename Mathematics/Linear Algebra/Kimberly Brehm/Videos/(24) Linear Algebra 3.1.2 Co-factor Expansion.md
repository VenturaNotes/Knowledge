	- [[co-factor expansion|cofactor expansion]]
	- What is it?
		- We just learned:
			- det A equation
				- $A_{11}$ is a [[submatrix]]. Take out first row and first column and find determinant of what's left over
				- Can write as summation
					- #question is equation correct in picture?
		- To make notation cleaner, let use the cofactor.
		- The [[cofactor]], $C_{ij}$, is the number given by $(-1)^{i +j}det A_{ij}$ 
			- $\therefore det A = a_{11}C_{11} + a_{12}C_{12} + ... + a_{1n}C_{1n}$
	- Definition
		- The determinant of any `nxn` matrix A can be computed by a cofactor expansion across any row or down any column
			- This would be an expansion across the $i^{th}$ row:
				- $det A = a_{i1}C_{i1} + a_{i2}C_{i2} + ... + a_{in}C_{in}$
			- This would be an expansion down the $j^{th}$ column
				- $det A = a_{1j}C_{1j} + a_{2j}C_{2j} + ... + a_{nj}C_{nj}$
		- This is important because will find the row or column that makes work easier to find the determinant
			- Job is easiest where you can get as many zeros as possible
	- Practice:
		- Compute `det` A where A, which we previously found to be -2
			- Solved using row 3
			- Solved again using column 3
			- These rows or columns had the most zeros which is why we used them to compute the determinant
	- Practice:
		- Find `det` A for A

	- Practice with a 4x4 matrix
		- Compute
	- One more cool thing
		- If A is a triangular matrix, then `det` A is a product of the entries on the main diagonal
		- This is theorem 2 in textbook
			- If you have a triangular matrix (where anything below diagonal is zeros), then the determinant of A is the product of the entries on the main diagonal
