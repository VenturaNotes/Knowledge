	- Writing Systems 
		- Systems
			- Equations
				- $x_1 + x_2 = 5$ 
				- $3x_1 - 2x_2 = 10$
			- Will only be using xs and no ys
			- Will have a bunch more variables than we're used to
		- 2 matrices we need to be familiar with
	- [[Coefficient Matrix]]
		- $\begin {bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 3 & -2 \end{bmatrix}$
		- Will only use coefficients in the systems of equations and won't use the solutions of 5 and 10
	- [[Augmented Matrix]]
		- $\left[\begin{array}{rr|r} 1 & 1 & 5 \\ 3 & -2 & 10 \\ \end{array}\right]$
			- Has both the coefficients and solution set of 5 and 10
			- Divider or solid line (textbook doesn't have divider commonly)
	- Example has two variables
	- Solve by [[elimination]] (multiplied first equation by 2 and then combined the two equations)
	- Solving by using an augmented matrix
		- When manipulating first row:
			- Index Notation Reference
				- ![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 4.22.13 PM.png|300]]
			- Using $2R_1 + R_2  \rightarrow R_1$, (This multiplies $row\space1$ by $2$ and then adds $row \space 2$ to replace the values in $row 1$ 
				-  $a_{1,1}$:  $2(1) + 3 = 5$
				- $a_{1,2}$: $2(1) - 2 = 0$
				- $a_{1,3}$: $2(5) + 10 = 20$
			- Will learn about proper [[row operations]] later
			- Want to solve for $x_1$ and $x_2$ 
	- Solving systems of linear equations using a matrix is much easier with more variables
	- Terminology
		- [[Linear Equation]]
			- An equation that can be written as $a_1x_1$ + $a_2x_2$ + $a_3x_3$ + .... + $a_nx_n =b$ where $a_1,a_2...a_n,b$ are real or complex numbers
				- b is the solution in this case
				- This is just saying that we have a linear equation like we had with $y=mx+b$ which is just a different form. Basically a standard form equation where we have variables and coefficients equal to some value.
		- [[System of Linear Equations]]
			- A collection of two or more linear equations using the same variables.
		- [[Solution]]
			- A list of numbers ($S_1,S_2,S_3,...$) that makes each equation in the system true when substituted for $x_1,x_2,x_3...$ respectively.
				- Must make each equation true
		- [[Solution Set]]
			- The set of all possible solutions to a system
				- You could just have 1 solution
				- Could be you have many solutions
				- Could be you have no solutions
- ![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 4.49.15 PM.png]]
	- There are 3 types of systems (or two types if talking about consistent vs inconsistent systems)
		- [[Inconsistent System]]
			- No solution
			- Equations never touch
		- [[Consistent System]]
			- [[One Solution]]
				- Could be an [[ordered pair]], or ordered triple, or however many values you have
				- If you have 5 variables, then you will have some value for each to make the equation true $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5)$. When replacing those values into the 5 equations, it will make each equation true 
			- [[Infinitely many solutions]] (two lines that are identical)
				- One line is stacked on top of the other one.
				- Everywhere that line is, is a solution to both equations.
	- Practice
		- Solve the given system of equations using elimination
		- Steps
			- (White): Cancel 1 variable so you're left with 2
			- (Yellow): Cancel another variable so you're left with 1
			- (Green): Use variable solved with (White) equations
			- (Red): Use 2 variables solved to find last variable from (Red) Equations
			- All Solutions found
				- Will always write final solution as an [[ordered pair]] or an [[ordered triple]] (in this case)
