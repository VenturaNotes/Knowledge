	- [[Nonhomogeneous system]] solutions
	- Translating our homogeneous solution
		- Solution to Ax = b are translations to solutions of $Ax = 0$ 
			- #comment Both of these seem to be lines on coordinate system
		- Dealing with [[parametric form]]
			- Homogeneous solutions: $\vec x = t \vec v \text { or } \vec x = t\vec u + s \vec w$
			- Nonhomogeneous solutions: $\vec x = p + t\vec v$ 
				- `p` will be the translations
				- Shifts plane `b` units
	- Practice
		- The [[coefficient matrix]] should look familiar as used in last example.
			- The right-most column is not all zeros meaning that it is nonhomogeneous
		- Found pivots and $x_3$ is free
		- `p` is simply the translation of our homogeneous solution of $t \vec v$ 
	- Practice
		- #comment She said it was a "non-parametric equation" but I think she meant "non-homogeneous equation" since the solution set is not all zeros
