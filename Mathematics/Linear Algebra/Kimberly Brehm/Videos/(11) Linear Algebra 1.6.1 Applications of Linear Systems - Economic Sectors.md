	- Applications of linear systems: [[Economic sector|economic sectors]].
	- Suppose an economy has only two sectors, goods and services. Goods sells 80% of its output to services each year and keeps the rest. Services sells 70% of its output to goods and keeps the rest. Find equilibrium prices for each sector that make their income match their expenditures
		- Can write as an [[augmented matrix]]
		- Looking for general solution
		- We're looking at the ratio of expenditures and output from each sector
