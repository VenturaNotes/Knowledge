- What does it mean?
	- A system of linear equations that can be written in the form $A_x = 0$ is called homogeneous.
	- Trivial Solution: x = 0
		- You'll have some matrix a multiplied by some vector x which will equal to 0

		- This makes sense to have a trivial solution because

	- Non-trivial solution: x $\neq$ 0 $\leftarrow$ We want to solve for x

		- Example 2 (Can change x vector to anything we want and still have a 0 solution)

	- $A_x=0$ must have at least 1 free variable
		- 1 free variable example such as $x_1$ (goes through 1 point)
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 7.41.37 AM.png]]
		- If 2 free variables ($x_1$ and $x_2$), then $x_3$ will vary based on what's being changed for $x_1$ and $x_2$ . Will look like a plane still crossing through that same point

- Example
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 8.07.21 AM.png]]
		- Because there is no pivot in $x_3$, we know that $x_3$ is free
		- $x_3\begin {bmatrix} 4/3 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ The solution is now some constant $x_3$ times vector $\vec{v}$ 
			- This brings us to parametric vector form. Parametric vector equation says that you can write x as some constant * some vector ($x=tv$ ). $x_3$ = t in this case

	- Want to create a parametric vector equation in terms of the free variable $x_3$ 
- 2 Free variables
