	- [[Linear Independence|linearly independent]] sets and [[bases (math)|bases]]
	- What we already know (videos 1.7.1 and 1.7.2)
		- An indexed set of vectors {$v_1, v_2, ... vp$} in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is linearly independent if the vector equation $x_1v_1 + x_2v_2 + ... + x_pv_p = 0$ has only the trivial solution
			- If it only has the trivial solution, then $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = ... x_p = 0$. So all x-values or scalars would have to equal to 0 to only have the trivial solution
		- [[Linear dependence]]
			- A non-trivial solution exists
			- Vectors are multiples of one another
				- Examples would be $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 2 \end{bmatrix}$ and $\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 4 \end{bmatrix}$
			- A vector is a linear combination of other vectors in the set
				- For the vectors $v, w, z$ example, you can find combination of $v$ and $w$ to get to $z$ 
			- There are more vectors than entries in each vector
				- In the $v, w, z$ example, since there are 3 vectors and only 2 variables in each vector, there is bound to be a [[free parameter|free variable]]
					- A free variable means obviously more than just the non-trivial solution will exist
	- Examples
		- Are the vectors linearly independent?
			- Determining this if we have free variable or only the trivial solution which is why we're augmenting it with a zero vector.
			- If we end up with an [[identity matrix]] on the left side, it means we have no free variables and the only solution to $Ax = 0$ is the trivial solution so it's linearly independent
		- Is {$p_1, p_2, p_3$} linearly independent?
			- Dealing with [[Polynomial|polynomials]] here 
			- Since $p_3$ can be written as a linear combination of $p_1$ and $p_2$, these are [[Linear Dependence|linearly dependent]] 
	- [[Basis]] - what is it?
		- Let H be a subspace of vector space v. $\mathcal{B} = \{b_1, b_2...b_p\}$  is a basis for H if:
			- 1) B is linearly independent
			- 2) H = span {$b_1, b_2 ... b_p$}
				- H is a subspace here
		- Example: B = {$\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$} forms a Basis of $\mathbb{R}^2$ 
			- They are linearly independent
			- They would span all of $\mathbb{R}^2$ because you can get to anywhere in $\mathbb{R}^2$ by some linear combination of the above two vectors
			- So those two vectors are a basis of $\mathbb{R}^2$ 
		- Recall that if A is an invertible $n \times n$ matrix, the columns are linearly independent and span $\mathbb{R}^n$ by [[invertible matrix theorem|IMT]]
	- Example
		- Given $v_1$ and $v_2$
			- are they a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$? (a basis for neither)
		- Since three are 3 entries in each of the vectors, they belong in the set $\mathbb{R}^3$. Since they belong to $\mathbb{R}^3$, they could not possibly form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^2$ because they won't span $\mathbb{R}^2$ 
		- Our previous definition says that H was a subspace of the vector space and obviously $v_1$ and $v_2$ are not a [[subspace]] of $\mathbb{R}^3$ which is our [[vector space]] in this case
		- Not a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$ as not every row would have a pivot
			- So {$v_1, v_2$} doesn't span $\mathbb{R}^3$ so not a basis.

	- Example
		- Determine if the set of vectors form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$  (yes)
			- Just checking if pivot in every row so it is a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$ as they can be row reduced to $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$ which span $\mathbb{R}^3$ and are linearly independent
	- [[Standard basis]]
		- We just found the set of vectors from a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$. But we also know form a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$. What gives? 
			- Our standard basis is our base of basis
				-  $\begin{bmatrix}1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 1 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$, $\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \end{bmatrix}$
			- $\mathbb{P}^4 = \{t^0, t^1, t^2, t^3, t^4\}$
				- This would span $\mathbb{P}^4$ and be linearly independent
