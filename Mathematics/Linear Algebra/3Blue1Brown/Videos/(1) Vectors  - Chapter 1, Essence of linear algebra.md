	- "The introduction of numbers as coordinates is an act of violence" - Hermann Weyl
	- Building block of linear algebra is the vector 
		- There are 3 distinct but related ideas about vectors (from different perspectives)
			- Physics Student
				- Vectors are arrows pointing in space
				- What defines a given vector is its length and the direction it's pointing in
					- As long as these two facts are the same, you can move it around and it's the same vector
				- Vectors that live in a flat plane are two-dimensional
					- Those sitting in a broader space where you and I live in is three-dimensional
			- Mathematician
				- Tries to generalize both the physics and computer science views
				- A vector can be anything where there is a sensible notion of adding two vectors, and multiplying a vector by a number (operations will be reviewed later)
				- Details of this view are rather abstract
				- Hints at the fact that vector addition and multiplication by numbers will play an important role throughout linear algebra
			- Computer Science (CS) Student
				- Vectors are ordered lists of numbers
					- If you did analytics on house prices and the only features you cared about are square footage and price, you might model each house with a pair of numbers
						- First indicates square footage
						- Second indicates price
					- Order matters
					- You'd be modeling houses as two-dimensional vectors (Vector is just a fancy word for list. It's 2 dimensional because length of list is 2)

	- When talking about vectors, first think about an arrow and think of arrow inside coordinate-system (such as x-y plane) with tail at origin
	- Although in physics vectors freely sit anywhere they want in space, in linear algebra, it is almost always the case that your vector will be rooted at the origin
	- When we understand concept of arrows in space, we'll translate it over to the list of numbers point of view (which is by considering the coordinates of the vector)
