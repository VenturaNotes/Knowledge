	- Matrices is a plural for matrix
	- A matrix is a table of numbers
		- Use a capital letter (and maybe bold) to represent a matrix
			- boldface capital letter
	- two by three matrix (2x3) is shown as example
		- Sometimes written below bold letter
		- 2 rows
		- 3 columns
	- A 5 by 2 matrix
		- 5 rows and 2 columns
	- Can reference terms in matrix
		- 2nd row 2nd column is $A[2,2] = 0$ or $a_{2,2} = 0$
		- $a_{1,3} = 2$
			- First row, third column
	- A matrix is just a data representation (writing down data)
		- Used to represent linear equations
		- If doing [[computer graphics]] on a matrix, the elements can represent pixels on screen
		- Numbers could represent points in a coordinate space
	- Matrices are not a natural phenomenon. It's just a way to represent a mathematical concept or a way of representing values
		- Might need to define what it's representing
	- Will learn how to add, multiply, invert, and determinant of matrices
		- These are mostly human-defined conventions

	- [[Matrix Addition]]
		- This is just human convention. Someone defined how matrices add
		- Just add corresponding elements
		- Can do A + B or B + A (same)
		- Both matrices need to be the same size
			- Need corresponding elements to add up
	- [[Matrix Subtraction]]
		- A - B = A + (-1) $*$ B
			- When multiplying a [[scalar]] (multiplying a number to a matrix, you just multiply the number to every one of its elements)
				- Scalar multiplies all elements of matrix
		- Both matrices need to be the same size
			- Need corresponding elements to add up
	- When a matrix has one of its dimensions as 1, such as a 1x2 (1 row and multiple columns), this is known as [[row vector]]
	- A [[vector]] is a one-dimensional matrix where one of the dimensions is 1
	- A 2x1 is a [[column vector]]
