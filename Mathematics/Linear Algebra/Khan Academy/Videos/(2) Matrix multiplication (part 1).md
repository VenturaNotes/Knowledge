	- [[Matrix multiplication]]
		- To multiply the first element, you essentially use [[dot product]] on the first row of the first matrix and the first column on the second matrix
			- $2*10 + -3*12 = -16$
				- Dot product example
		- AB $\ne$ BA
			- Order matter
			- There are matrices you can multiply one way but not the other way
	- [[Matrix addition]]
		- A + B = B + A
		- When adding or subtracting, the matrices need to have the same dimensions
