	- 0, 1, or $\infty$-many solutions
	- A system of linear equations has only 0, 1, or infinity many different solutions
	- When $0x_1 + 0x_2 = -1$
		- You have no solutions or [[inconsistent]]
		- Is there a contradiction there? (yes)
	- $x_2$ = s ([[free parameter]]) from $0x_1 + 0x_2 = 0$
		- $\infty$-many solutions
		- "free parameter" also called "free variable"
			- Any arbitrary symbol "s"
		- Is there a freedom there? (yes)
	- Third example
		- Leading 1 in first row and leading 1 in second row
		- Gives one solution or a [[unique solution]]
		- Is there a unique solution? (yes)
	- Key idea to this exercise is that after doing row operations to put it in ideal [[upper triangular]] form, the bottom rows look very different
