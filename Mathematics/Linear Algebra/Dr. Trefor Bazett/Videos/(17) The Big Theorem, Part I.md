	- Errata
		- Geometric question: Spans $\mathbb{R}^2$
		- Question: For every $\vec{b}$, can we solve for $\vec{x}$?
	- The Big Theorem, part 1
		- The following are equivalent (TFAE)
			- (1) The columns of A span $\mathbb{R}^m$
			- (2) For every $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $\vec{b}$ is some linear combo of the columns of A
			- (3) For every $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has a solution
			- (4) The RREEF of A has a leading 1 (or pivot) in every row

	- This will be solvable in every single scenario
