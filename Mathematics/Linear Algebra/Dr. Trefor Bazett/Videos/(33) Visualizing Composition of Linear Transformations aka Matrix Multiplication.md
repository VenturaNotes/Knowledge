	- Transformations above shown
	- Doing one transformation and then another is known as a composition of transformations

	- A linear combination is by definition matrix multiplication
	- Matrix multiplication represents the matrix that comes from the transformation that is a composition of different transformations

	- For $m \times n$ matrix $A = (\vec{a_1}... \vec{a_n})$ And an $n \times p$ matrix $B = (\vec{b_1}...\vec{b_p})$. Then we get an $m\times p$ matrix $AB = (A\vec{b_1}... A\vec{b_p})$
	- AB = BA only sometimes!
