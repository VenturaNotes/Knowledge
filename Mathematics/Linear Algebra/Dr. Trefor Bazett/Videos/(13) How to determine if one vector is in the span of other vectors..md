	- To say that one vector is in the span of a bunch of other vectors is to say that this vector can be written as a linear combination of these other vectors
	- Can I take some linear combination?
	- The scalars are the variables
		- What possible scalars can we multiply these vectors to such that this linear combination will add up to $\vec{b}$
	- By going through the gaussian elimination, we've managed to get the values.
		- This method solves this entire class of problems. If you have a bunch of different vectors and you want to ask if some other vector is in the span, then we're asking can we write this particular linear combination which will be a system of linear equations in terms of the scalars being the variables.
			- We get the linear system. We translate it into a matrix. We solve that matrix as we know how to do and we get that final result
