	- Nice properties of [[Homogeneous system|homogeneous systems]] $A\vec{x} = \vec{0}$
		- (1) $\vec{0}$ is always a solution. 
			- An m$\times$ n matrix is always going to take n vectors and spit out m vectors
			- Follows definition for our [[matrix vector product]]
		- (2) $A(\vec{x_1} + \vec{x_2}) = A\vec{x_1} + A\vec{x_2}$
			- Property of [[Matrix-Vector Multiplication]]
			- Sum is also solution to homogeneous
		- (3) Every solution to $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ is the sum of one [[particular]] solution and a [[homogeneous]] solution
	- Homogeneous systems went through the origin
	- $\vec{x_p}$ represents particular
			- $\vec{h_h}$ represents solution to homogeneous
