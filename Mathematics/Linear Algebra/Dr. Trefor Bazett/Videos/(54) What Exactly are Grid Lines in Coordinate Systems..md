	- [[grid line|grid lines]] in coordinates systems
	- With the standard basis vectors, we've created the standard grid system
	- Grid systems are all about taking integer values
	- Grid intersections are integer combinations
		- Grid systems are all the integer linear combinations of the standard basis vectors
	- You can represent a vector in any coordinate system

	- Why don't we always use the standard basis vectors?
		- If we have a [[subspace]] which is a plane living in $\mathbb{R}^3$. We have 2 different basis vectors that are living on that plane
		- The standard basis vectors not even on the subspace
			- Can't describe the subspace as some linear combination of the standard basis vectors any longer because it doesn't fit there anywhere
			- Therefore, we need to create a coordinate system out of them
				- Just take all the integer linear combinations of them and you'll get all the intersection points
					- Now we have another grid system on them
					- Lines are separated by integer multiples of the two different basis vectors
	- If in some sort of [[subspace]], can still have coordinate systems, can still have grid lines, you get to use any other basis
