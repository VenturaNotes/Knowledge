	- Errata
		- Solution for $x_1 = 3s - 2t$
	- [[Back substitution]] with $\infty$-many solutions
		- We'll see there are 2 different infinite families of solutions
	- $R_1 \iff R_2$
		- $\iff$ is read as interchanged
	- [[Free columns]]
		- Columns that do not have a leading 1
		- We have 4 variables
			- We have 2 different equations that puts constraints on them
			- 2 degrees of freedom (2nd and 4th column has no constraint)
	- $x_2 = s$ and $x_4 = t$
		- These are [[free parameter|free variables]]
	- Given any value for s and t, we can figure out what our $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$ is going to be. There are infinitely many solutions but they're clustered. Clustered into these 2 different families. Constraints of system put these constraints on outputs of the $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$
	- If we have 100 different free columns, we'll get 100 different free variables, and we would have 100 families of infinite solutions
