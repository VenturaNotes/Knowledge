	- The Matrix Equation $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$
	- Recall linear combination
		- Vectors will live in $\mathbb{R}^m$
			- They have m different components
	- For $a_{11}$
		- Second component tells me I'm in the first vector
		- First component goes all the way down to the mth component
	- First component tells you what row you're in
	- Second component tells you that you're in the nth column or vector in linear combination
	- Going to find something called a [[matrix vector product]]
	- =:
		- Defining thing on right that I don't understand by the thing on left that I do understand
	- $\vec{x}$
		- Lives inside $\mathbb{R}^n$
	- $\vec{b}$ lives in $\mathbb{R}^m$
		- Has m different components
	- One way to conceive about a matrix is that it's something that transforms vectors living in $\mathbb{R}^n$ to vectors living in $\mathbb{R}^m$
