	- [[Span]] {$\vec{a}, \vec{b}$}
		- The span of two vectors sweeps out an entire plane

	- Rigorous proof that a span is a subspace
	- Claim: Span{$\vec{a},\vec{b}$} is a subspace
	- The span is a subspace (such as lines, everything and zero vector)
	- If you have any subspace, that subspace can be written as the span of a finite number of vectors
		- There are no subspaces that are not spans of some list of vectors
	- If you have a subspace, what's the list of vectors that makes it a span?
