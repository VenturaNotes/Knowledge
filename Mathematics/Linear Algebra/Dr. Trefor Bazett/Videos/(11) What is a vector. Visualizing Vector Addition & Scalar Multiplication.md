	- [[Vector|Vectors]] 
	- Take 2 steps east and 1 step north
		- This is an instruction that is independent of where we're standing
	- (2, 1) is the x and y values of the endpoint of arrow drawn
	- The vector Matrix: $\begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 1\end{bmatrix}$ is an instruction, telling us to go 2 to the right, and 1 up
		- Could imagine that the vector starts anywhere on the plane. (similar to gravity)
	- To change perspective, could think of vector as thing that's fixed, and what's changing is the underlying coordinate system
		- Vector doesn't move but the coordinate system does
			- May be at different origins
	- You can stretch a vector
		- [[Scalar multiplication]]
			- By multiplying a vector by a scalar, then we multiply all the components of the vector by that scalar
			- Takes length of vector and makes it twice as long
	- Could combine 2 vectors
		- Can align vectors tip to tail way
		- "Tip-to-Tail" [[Vector addition]]
			- Tells us how we can add 2 different vectors. The answer is that we line them up in this tip to tail way.
			- When adding vectors, we're adding them component to component
			- Can commute order of vectors when adding
