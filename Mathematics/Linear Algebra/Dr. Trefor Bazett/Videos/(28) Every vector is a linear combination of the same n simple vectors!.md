	- Writing vectors in the "standard basis"
	- Matrix vector multiplication was defined to be the linear combinations of the columns of the matrix
	- A vector is an instruction that tells you what linear combination of a standard basis vectors are you taking? Every vector can be written in this way. It's telling you which particular linear combination of the standard basic vectors are you talking about?
