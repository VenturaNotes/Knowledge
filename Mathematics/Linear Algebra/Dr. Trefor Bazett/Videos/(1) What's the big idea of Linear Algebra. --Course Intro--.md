	- Algebraic and geometric merge together in linear algebra
	- [[Linear Transformation]]
		- (1) Lines go to lines
		- (2) Origin stays put
	- Four numbers tell us everything!
	- Arbitrary Transformation
		- Linear Transformation
	- Transformation in geometric world is imposing that a straight line has to got to a straight line and the origin to itself
	- Algebraic constraint is that any of the input variables has to appear as only that to the power of 1

	- Geometrically, inverts the transformation
	- What is the corresponding algebraic rule?
