	- [[Linear Dependence]]
	- [[Linear Independence]]
	- Checking if set of vectors is linearly dependent or linearly independent
	- Definition: {$\vec{x_1}, ...\vec{x_n}$} is
		- (1) Linearly dependent if can find $a_1, ..., a_n$ not all zero so $a_1\vec{x_1} + ... + a_n\vec{x_n} = \vec{0}$
			- If you can find coefficients that are not all zero but such that the conclusion that you got a linear combination of them that adds up to being 0 is true
		- (2) Linearly independent if $a_1\vec{x_1} + ... + a_n\vec{x_n} = \vec{0}$ forces $a_1 = a_2 = ... = a_n = 0$
			- Forces all of the coefficients to all be 0
			- No way to write this so that there is any linear dependence
	- Abbreviated L.I means linearly independent
		- The 3 vectors x, y, and z in a plane are linearly dependent
		- 3 vectors along coordinate axes are not linearly dependent
