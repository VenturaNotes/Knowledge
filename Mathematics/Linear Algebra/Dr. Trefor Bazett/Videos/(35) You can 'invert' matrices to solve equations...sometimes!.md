	- Errata
		- $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I$
	- [[Invertible Matrices]]
	- [[Multiplicative Inverse]]
		- 3 and $\frac 13$ cancel to become 1
	- Definition: A is invertible if there exists a matrix $A^{-1}$ such that 
		- $AA^{-1} = A^{-1}A = I$
	- Facts: 
		- (1) Every $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has a unique solution if A is invertible!
		- (2) Solutions come easily!
