	- Transformations
	- A function was a thing that transformed numbers
	- $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$
		- Linear system
	- Multivariable functions are considered where the inputs might live in $\mathbb{R}^n$ and the outputs might live in $\mathbb{R}^m$ as well
	- Use T in linear algebra for transformations
		- Inputs are in [[Domain (Math)|domain]]
		- Outputs are in [[codomain]]
		- Must have a unique output for every input
	- Ex: [[Matrix Transformation|Matrix Transformations]]
