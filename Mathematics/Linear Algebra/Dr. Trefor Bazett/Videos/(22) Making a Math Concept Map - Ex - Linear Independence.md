	- Linear Independence Concept Map
		- Definition: $\vec{a_1}, ..., \vec{a_n}$ are linearly independent if $x_1\vec{a_1} + ... + x_n\vec{a_n} = \vec{0} => x_1 = ... = x_n = 0$
			- Scalars
			- Vectors
			- Linear combination
			- In given example, there is no way to take a linear combination of those getting to 0 unless we make the lengths of $\vec{a_1}$ and $\vec{a_2}$ 0 by multiplying by scalars that are 0. This makes it linearly independent (can't add to zero)
				- "no loops to zero"
			- In given example for linearly dependent (adds to zero)
	- 1 solution means no free columns (linearly independent)
		- Leading 1 in every column
	- $\infty$-many solutions means free columns (linearly dependent)
		- At least 1 column with no leading 1
	- 1:1 also means $A\vec{x}$ has [[unique solution]]
