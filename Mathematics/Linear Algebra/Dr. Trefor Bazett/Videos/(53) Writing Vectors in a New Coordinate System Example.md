	- An effective method to take one vector and write it in terms of some other [[Basis|basis]] (some other coordinate system) 
	- How to write vector ($\vec{x}$) in the $\mathcal{B}$ basis
		- What are the coefficients so it can be written as a [[linear combination]] of the b1 and b2?
		- Linear combinations and multiplying by the same matrix are the same thing
	- This matrix is called $P_\mathcal{B}$. This is a matrix associated to every single basis
		- You just take the vectors of the basis and put them in as the columns of the matrix
	- $(\vec{x})_\mathcal{B}$ 
		- Vector x written in the B basis
	- Since it is a basis where the vectors are independent (if you row reduced, it will have a leading 1 in every single column. Therefore, the matrix will be invertible)
	- Can use the row reduction methodology but if it's a square matrix, you can just invert it
	- General formulas at bottom
