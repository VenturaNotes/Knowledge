	- Finding a [[Basis|basis]] for a [[subspace]]
	- This system is solvable for every $\vec{b}$ when A has a leading 1 in every row!
	- Definition
		- A set of vectors $\vec{a}_1, ..., \vec{a}_n$ is a basis for a subspace if
			- (1) $\vec{a}_1, ..., \vec{a}_n$ span the subspace
			- (2) $\vec{a}_1, ..., \vec{a}_n$ are linearly independent
	- A basis is a set of vectors that spans the subspace we're interested in but has as few vectors as possible.
