	- Finding a Basis for Null(A) & Col(A)
	- Two different canonical subspaces
		- Null Space of a transformation
		- Column Space of a transformation
	- [[Null space]] can be thought of as all of the vectors in your domain that get mapped to 0
		- The null space represents all of the vectors that are solutions to $A\vec{x} = 0$ or solutions to the homogeneous system
	- [[Column space]] lives in the codomain and represents all of the different solutions to $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$. What vectors $\vec{b}$ can be written as a linear combination of the columns of A
	- Recall: A [[Basis|basis]] for a subspace is a list of vectors that 
		- (1) spans the subspace
			- Linear combinations of the vectors on the list can hit any possible vector in the subspace
		- (2) is linearly independent
			- Don't want too many vectors on list

	- Note: free columns are linear combinations of the columns with leading 1s.
	- For null space, those special vectors with parameters on the front, those vectors will be a basis for the null space.   
	- For column space, only consider the columns of leading 1s and those are always going to form our basis
