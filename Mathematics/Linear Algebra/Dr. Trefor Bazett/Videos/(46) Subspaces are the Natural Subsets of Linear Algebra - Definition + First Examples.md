	- Vector Addition
	- Scalar Multiplication
	- [[Subspace]] S of a Vector Space is a subset such that if $\vec{x}, \vec{y}, \in S, c \in \mathbb{R}$
		- (1) $\vec{0} \in S$
		- (2) $c\vec{x} \in S$
		- (3) $\vec{x} + \vec{y} \in S$
	- Lines through the origin are subspaces

	- More examples (some pathological)
	- All of $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a subspace
	- {$\vec{0}$} is a subspace
		- [[Zero vector]] is a subspace
