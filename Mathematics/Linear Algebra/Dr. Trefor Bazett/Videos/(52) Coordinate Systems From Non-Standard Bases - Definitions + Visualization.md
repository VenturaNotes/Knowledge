	- Coordinate system is some way we can keep track of points
		- In terms of an instruction
	- B = {$\vec{b_1}, \vec{b_2}$} is a [[Basis|basis]] of $\mathbb{R}^2$
		- (1) Linear independent
		- (2) Spans $\mathbb{R}^2$

	- For a basis B = {$\vec{b_1}, \vec{b_2}$} if $\vec{x}$ = $c_1\vec{b_1} + c_2\vec{b_2}$, then ($\vec{x}_B) =$ $c_1 \choose c_2$
	- ($\vec{x}$)$_{\Huge\varepsilon}$
		- Denotes we're in the [[standard basis]]
		- Often we don't bother with this
