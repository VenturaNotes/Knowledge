	- When a matrix is not invertible
		- (1) Not $nxn$ (ie square)
		- (2) Invertible $\iff$ ad-bc $\ne$ 0
		- (3) If we can't go to the identity matrix, we claim it's not invertible. If it's invertible, it has to go to the identity matrix
			- in RREF, $A \to I$
				- so A invertible $\iff$ A $\to$ I
	- $I_4$
		- Represents identity matrix that's $4\times4$
