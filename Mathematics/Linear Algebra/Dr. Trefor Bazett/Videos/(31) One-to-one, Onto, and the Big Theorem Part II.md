	- An [[onto transformation]] is when every single thing in codomain gets hit my something from the domain
		- Every vector in codomain will have some vector in the domain that transforms into it
	- Definition: T is onto if every vector $\vec{y} \in \mathbb{R}^m$ has $\vec{y} = T(\vec{x})$ for some $\vec{x} \in \mathbb{R}^n$. 
		- For any y in codomain, there is an x inside domain such that the transformation of x is equal to y
	- Definition: T is one-to-one if $T(\vec{x_1}) = T(\vec{x_2})$ forces $\vec{x_1} = \vec{x_2}$
		- When every pair of vectors go to two different things, that'll be called a [[one-to-one transformation]]
	- If $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ has a solution, it has $\infty$ many solutions so not 1:1
		- Two free variables so not 1:1
	- If $A\vec{x} = \vec{b}$ not solvable for all $\vec{b}$, so not onto
		- Since bottom row is all 0s

	- The Big Theorem, Part 2
		-  The following are equivalent (TFAE)
			- (1) The columns of A span $\mathbb{R}^m$
			- (2) For every $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $\vec{b}$ is some linear combo of the columns of A
			- (3) For every $\vec{b} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ has a solution
			- (4) The RREEF of A has a leading 1 (or pivot) in every row 
			- (5) Transformation $A\vec{x}$ is onto
