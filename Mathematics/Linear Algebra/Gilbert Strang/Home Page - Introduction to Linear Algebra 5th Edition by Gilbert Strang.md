## Preface
- ![[Screenshot 2023-04-15 at 7.36.41 PM.png|600]]
	- “The front cover captures a central idea of linear algebra.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/33XSVBKT?page=2&annotation=YJLNV2GG))
		- “The complete solution is x = y + z. Then Ax = Ay + Az = b.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/33XSVBKT?page=2&annotation=4TJQSLMA))
- Book was published April 30th, 2016 [^1]
- “A sabbatical gave me a chance to prepare two new chapters about probability and statistics and understanding data.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/33XSVBKT?page=5&annotation=J5ZAW3E6))
- “The cover shows the Four Fundamental Subspaces-the row space and nullspace are on the left side, the column space and the nulls pace of A$^T$ are on the right.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/33XSVBKT?page=6&annotation=2D6TFWWU))
- “start from a matrix A. Each row of A is a vector in n-dimensional space. When the matrix has m rows, each column is a vector in m-dimensional space.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/33XSVBKT?page=6&annotation=KX4TV2JU))
	- “The crucial operation in linear algebra is to take linear combinations of column vectors.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/33XSVBKT?page=6&annotation=K72365WY))
		- “This is exactly the result of a matrix-vector multiplication. Ax is a combination of the columns of A.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/33XSVBKT?page=6&annotation=7MINE58P))
- “When we take all combinations Ax of the column vectors, we get the column space. If this space includes the vector b, we can solve the equation Ax = b.”
- “inverse matrix and its connection to calculus.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/33XSVBKT?page=6&annotation=28K5UEUP))
