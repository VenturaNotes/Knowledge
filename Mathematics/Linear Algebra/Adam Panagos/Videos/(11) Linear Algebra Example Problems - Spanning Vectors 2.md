	- Spanning Vectors #2
	- Determining if these vectors span some space
		- We find that the vectors do not span $\mathbb{R}^2$ because 0 = b + 2a which shows that the equation is not true $\forall a,b$. This means no solution
	- If we look at the vectors chosen, we see that $v_1$ and $v_2$ are related to each other. We can actually get $v_2$ from $v_1$ if you multiply $v_1$ by a scalar of -2. So even though we have two vectors here, they are literally dependent on each other. 
		- They are the same vector but scaled by a number
		- Since we really only have one vector here, it can't span $\mathbb{R}^2$. We need 2 [[independent vectors]] to span $\mathbb{R}^2$. We'll talk about independence of vectors in other videos.
