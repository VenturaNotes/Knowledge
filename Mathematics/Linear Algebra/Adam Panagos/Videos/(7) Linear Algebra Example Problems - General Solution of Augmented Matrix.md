	- Consider the augmented matrix
		- Represents 3 equations with 3 unknowns and the final column represents represents equals sign part of equation.
		- When solving, we perform row reduction
			- row operations to reduced row echelon form
		- $A_{rr}$ means that it has been row reduced
		- A system of equations with no solution is a [[contradiction]]
	- Second example
		- [[basic variable]] and [[free parameter|free variable]]
			- Basic variables easy to identify. Just look for each column that has a [[pivot]]. 
			- In this example, $x_1$ would be a basic variable
			- Column 2 has a pivot so $x_2$ is a basic variable
		- Other columns have no pivots so we call them free variables
			- $x_3$ 
		- There is an infinite number of solutions
			- $x_3$ can be any number
	- Third example
		- Identifying basic variables and free variables
		- This example has multiple free variables
