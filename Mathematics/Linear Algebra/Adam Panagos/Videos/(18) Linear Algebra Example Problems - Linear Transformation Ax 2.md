	- [[Linear Transformation]]
	- Consider the LT T(x) = Ax
	- Find x such that Ax = b
		- So give me a vector x such that after my matrix A operates on it, I get the vector b. Is x unique?
		- x is unique because there is only a single solution
			- In this case we have a unique vector x
			- It would not be unique if we had a row of all zeros in the row reduced matrix giving a free variable
