	- Linear Combinations of Vectors Example #1
	- Each vector shown is a length 3 vector
	- Checking if a vector is a [[linear combination]] of 3 vectors? 
		- Mathematically: $\alpha_1x_1 + \alpha_2x_2 + \alpha_3x_3 = b$?
			- Writing "b" as a weighted linear combination of the vectors $x_1$, $x_2$, and $x_3$
			- Can you find some numbers (the alphas), such that when I weight each vector and add them up, can I get "b" out of this?
		- We find a solution for this. b is a linear combination. Found the coefficients to be 2, -3, and 1
			- Another way of saying this is that b $\in$ [[span]] {$x_1, x_2, x_3$}
	- Another way of saying that "b" is a linear combination of these vectors is to just say that "b" is in the span of the set of the vectors because the definition of a span of vectors is a set that is the linear combination of all vectors
		- The quantity right here for the span of {$x_1, x_2, x_3$}, this itself is a set that contains all linear combinations of $x_1$, $x_2$ and $x_3$ 
		- We just figured out that "b" is a particular linear combination of $x_1,x_2, \text{ and }x_3$ so "b" is in the set
			- Another way of saying that "b" is a linear combination of $x_1,x_2,x_3$
