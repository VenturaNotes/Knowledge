	- Matrix determinant properties
	- Will look at a useful property of determinants
	- First example
		- We just found that the `det(B) = - det(A)`
			- And this is just from the second and third rows being interchanged with each other
			- One row interchanged
			- Magnitudes were the same, just the sign flip flopped
	- Second example
		- Row 1 switched with row 2
		- Row 2 switched with row 3
		- We found that `det(C) = det(A)`
			- Two rows interchanged
	- Not a proof, but showing what happens when we interchange rows of matrices. It's just the sign that changes possibly
	- Not a proof, but in general, a sign of `det`($\cdot$) changes each time a row is interchanged
		- If you have one row interchanged, you multiply by -1
		- If you have two rows interchanged, then you multiply -1 twice
