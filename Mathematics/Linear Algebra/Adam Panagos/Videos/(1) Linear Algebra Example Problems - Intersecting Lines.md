	- [[Intersecting lines]]
		- Consider the following lines. Do they intersect? Where?
	- [[Substitution Method]]
	- [[Graphical Method]]
	- [[Parallel lines]]
		- No intersection
		- No solution
	- When using substitution method, if system of equations does not have a solution, you'll eventually encounter something called a contradiction
		- Something nonsensical, you'll get no solution (and no intersection)
