	- Find the [[reduced row echelon form]] of the following [[matrix]]
		- First non-zero number is a 1. Below it has to be zeros
		- Next row must have zeros until you hit a 1. Then zeros below that
		- Any column that has a [[pivot]] (the ones), that can be the only non-zero term there
	- The bottom example is an example of a reduced row echelon form.
		- For every row, the first non-zero entry is 1 and zeros below it. Applies to each row. Must be the only non-zero entry in its column as well
