	- This system of linear equations has a variable in it "a"
	- For what value of "a" is the system [[consistent]]?
	- We find that
		- in $(a-6)x_2 = -11$, $(a-6)$ cannot equal zero because otherwise contradiction. Creates an inconsistent equation
		- Also $x_2 = \frac {-11}{a-6}$, $a-6$ cannot equal zero because violated a fundamental law of dividing by zero
	- Solution: 
		- System is consistent $\forall a$ except a = 6
