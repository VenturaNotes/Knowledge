	- [[Area]] of a [[Parallelograms|parallelogram]]
		- [[Determinants]] can be used to determine the area of a parallelogram
	- Consider the parallelogram with vertices
	- Will have a point array vertex at (0, 0)
	- Can compute surface area of parallelogram. Turns out we can do that using determinants pretty easily
	- So the parallelogram area is = to total area - sum of triangles - sum of the strips
	- This was just a 2D parallelogram. The math goes to higher dimensions as well. Just gets a lot harder to visualize and draw. Can compute the 3D volume of a [[parallelepiped]] using determinant computations and can continue to go into higher dimensions as well.
