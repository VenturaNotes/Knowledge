	- Linearly independent vectors
	- $\alpha$ is a variable in the final vector
	- For what value of $\alpha$ are the vectors linearly dependent?
		- If there is more than one solution rather than the trivial case, then they are linearly dependent.
	- Can solve it by forming a [[homogeneous system of equations]]
		- Find family of solutions
	- Able to find $\alpha = 9$, for there to be a row of all zeros which means $x_3$ would be a free variable meaning there is an infinite number of solutions, meaning there is not just a trivial solution so therefore it's linearly dependent
	- So, clearly linearly dependent since one vector is a linear combination of two of the other vectors when $\alpha = 9$
