	- Errata
		- There is a mistake with the cofactors. There shouldn't be two $C_{23}$ in the adjugate matrix
		- Final solution does seem [correct](https://www.emathhelp.net/calculators/linear-algebra/adjoint-matrix-calculator/?i=%5B%5B-2%2C5%2C1%5D%2C%5B4%2C1%2C0%5D%2C%5B-3%2C5%2C5%5D%5D) though
	- [[Adjugate Matrix]] Computation
		- Compute the adjugate matrix of A
		- This needs to be a square matrix ($n\times n$)
			- In general, for $n \times n$ matrix
				- $adjA$ can be written in general form as shown
				- $C_{ij}$ are all just scalar numbers
					- Adjugate matrix is actually [[Transpose|transposed]] in this definition in terms of the cofactors so it's written down correctly. It's important to not get things out of order when populating the matrix 
				- $C_{ij}$ are [[Cofactor|cofactors]] of matrix A
	- Need to compute the cofactors
