	- Solving systems of equations using [[Gaussian operations|row operations]]
	- We will have 3 equations and 3 unknowns
	- [[Augmented Matrix]]
		- For each equation of system, you have a row and the coefficients of the matrix are the coefficients of the unknown variables. Final column will consist of values from right-hand side of equation
		- Will then perform row operations. Can:
			- Interchange rows
				- $E_1 \leftrightarrow E_2$ 
			- Multiply a row by a number
			- Add rows to other rows or linear combinations of other rows
	- Want [[augmented matrix]] to be in [[reduced row echelon form]]
		- Try to get 1s along diagonal of matrix
	- This systems of equations had a unique single solution
		- Following videos will look at cases with no solution or infinite number of solutions
