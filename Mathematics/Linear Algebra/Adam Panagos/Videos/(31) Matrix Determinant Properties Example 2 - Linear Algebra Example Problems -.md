	- Matrix Determinant Properties #2
	- Doing co-factor expansion of first row
	- Matrix B has second row multiplied by 3
	- Matrix B ended up being 3 times `det(A)`
	- Not a proof, but in general, replacing row with k$\times$row yields $detB = k \times detA$
		- This is a general property of matrix determinants that we can always use
	- If you happen to know the original determinant, you can simply scale the determinant by the appropriate value
