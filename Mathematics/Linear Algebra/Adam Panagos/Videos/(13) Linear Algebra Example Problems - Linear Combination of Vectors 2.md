	- Linear combinations of vectors #2
	- Found that 0 = 1 which is a [[contradiction]] meaning no solution
	- Since there is no solution, "b" is not a [[linear combination ]]of $x_1, x_2, x_3$ 
		- Same as saying b $\notin$ [[span]] {$x_1, x_2, x_3$}
			- The span of a set of vectors is a set and it contains all linear combinations of the vectors
