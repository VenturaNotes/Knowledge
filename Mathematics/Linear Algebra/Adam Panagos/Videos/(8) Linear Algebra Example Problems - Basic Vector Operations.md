	- Basic [[vector operations]]
		- Will add, subtract, multiply by scalars
		- Doing basic arithmetic on different dimensions of vector
	- Vectors of length 2
		- (a) Component-wise addition 
		- (b) Component-wise operation
			- Subtract components
		- (c) Includes scalars
			- Take scalar and multiply it by every single component of x
			- Linear combination of vectors example $3x + zy$ 
			- Each component of vector gets multiplied by scalar quantity
	- Vectors of length 3
		- Operations on vectors of n-dimensions essentially all work the same
