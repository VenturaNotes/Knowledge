	- Linearly Independent Vectors
		- [[Linear independence]]
			- If linear combination equals an all zero vector, if it has a solution that is only the trivial solution meaning the alphas = 0, then we say the vectors are linearly independent. If we can find the alphas that yield the all zero vector so alphas are not all zero, then we a non-trivial solution and we say the vectors are dependent
			- If there is only the trivial solution, then the vectors are independent. If there is more than the trivial solution, then the vectors are dependent.
		- Equation
			- Independent if $\alpha_1 \begin{bmatrix}2 \\ 2 \\1  \end{bmatrix}+ \alpha_2 \begin{bmatrix}-4 \\ 6 \\ 5 \end{bmatrix} + \alpha_3 \begin{bmatrix}-1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}$ has only only the trivial solution $x_1 = x_2 = x_3 = 0$
	- First example
		- Only solution is found to be the trivial solution so the vectors are linearly independent
	- Second Example
		- Found a family of answers. A collection of solutions because we found a free variable and 2 basic variables.
		- Found more than the trivial solution so the vectors are [[Linear Dependence|linearly dependent]]
