	- [[One-to-one linear transformations]]
		- One-to-one is a property that a linear transformation can have or not have. 
	- Going to look at linear transformations for this problem and determine if they are one-to-one
	- Part A
		- Consider the LT with standard matrix representation. Is this LT one-to-one?
			- If it has Linearly independent columns, then we know that this linear transformation is one-to-one
			- If it has linearly dependent columns, it is not one-to-one
		- Can figure this out by solving an augmented matrix
			- If it has only the trivial solution, then we know it's linearly independent
			- If many solutions, columns are dependent
		- Since there is a trivial solution, that means the columns are independent and therefore one-to-one
	- Part B
		- Found a free variable so infinite # of solutions so linearly dependent so not one-to-one
		- To check linear dependence, we form an augmented matrix corresponding to a homogeneous system of equations and we solve it.
