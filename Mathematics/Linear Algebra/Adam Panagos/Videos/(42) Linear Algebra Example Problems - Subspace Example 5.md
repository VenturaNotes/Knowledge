	- [[Subspace]] Example #5
		- Description
			- Consider the set $P_n$, consisting of all polynomials of degree at most n
				- Elements $p(x) \in P_n$, look like
					- $p(x) = a_0 + a_1x + a_2x^2 + ... + a_nx^n$ 
				- Is $P_2$ a subspace of $P_n$ for $n \ge 3?$ 
		- Collection of objects we'll work with here are [[Polynomial|polynomials]].
		- The concept of a [[vector space]] is very general. It's any collection of things that have certain axioms or properties that are satisfied
			- The things are often vectors like vectors in $\mathbb{R}^2$ or $\mathbb{R}^3$ or $\mathbb{R}^n$ 
			- But any collection of things that satisfies the vector space properties is a vector space
		- In this example, we're going to be working with polynomials and show that they satisfy certain vector space axioms to be a subspace 
		- $P_2$ is the set of all polynomials of at most degree 2. So these would be quadratics, linear equations, and constants.
		- We know that $P_2$ is a [[subset]] of $P_n$ because second degree polynomials can be found in the set of higher order polynomials $P_n$ 
		- Since it's a subset, instead of having to check all of the vector axioms or vector properties or vector space properties, there is only 3 things we need to check
	- (1) Does $P_2$ contain the zero vector? (YES)
		- $P_2$ does contain the zero vector
	- (2) Closed under addition? (YES)
		- #question What does the hat over the equal sign mean? He says something about "defining as", but not sure.
		- We find that the sum of two arbitrary elements from $P_2$ gives a polynomial of [[order]] 2 and they are arbitrary coefficients meaning it looks like any other element in the set $P_2$ 
		- Chose arbitrary elements from the vector space. Added them together and ended up with a vector in the vector space so it's closed under vector addition
			- It was closed under vector / polynomial addition
	- (3) Closed under scalar multiplication? (YES)
		- Can define $ca_0$ as a new number to $d_0$ using the $\overset \triangle =$ notation it seems like
		- Chose an arbitrary starting vector. Chose an arbitrary constant. Formed the scalar multiplication and ended up with an element still in the set we were working with
	- Since $P_2$ is a subset of $P_n$ $n \ge 3$ and 3 properties hold, $P_2$ is a subspace of $P_n$ n $\ge$ 3
	- For the general concept of vector spaces, that vector spaces are just collections of things with addition and scalar multiplication defined that satisfies certain properties
		- Often vector spaces and subspaces are literally vectors like $\mathbb{R}^3$, $\mathbb{R}^4$, and $\mathbb{R}^n$ 
		- However, sometimes the collection of objects can be more general such as polynomials, matrices, or other quantities.
	- So we worked with a subspace that was a subspace of a vector space, but the underlying objects weren't vectors. They were actually polynomials
