	- Will investigate the [[null space]] of a matrix
		- We are going to be interested in determining if certain vectors ore in the null space of A or not
	- Matrices have null spaces. Those null spaces consist of all the vectors such that Ax equals the all [[zero vector]]
		- Just need to form the [[matrix vector product]] to find this
		- If you get the all zero vector, it is a null space
	- First one not in null space
