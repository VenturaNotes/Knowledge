	- When we encounter an equation with all zeros, it means that $x_3$ is a [[free parameter|free variable]] which means that in the solution of the systems of equations, $x_3$ is allowed to be any value we choose and then $x_1$ and $x_2$ are going to have values based on the values we choose for $x_3$. 
		- Technically, you could just make $x_1$ the free variable here if you interchanged the third row with the first row.
	- The way the solution would end up being parameterized would look a little different but the set of solutions would still be identically the same.
		- Won't get a different answer but may get an answer that looks a little different, and the whole would be the exact same answer
		- This is a [[family of solutions]] or an infinite number of solutions to the systems of equations
