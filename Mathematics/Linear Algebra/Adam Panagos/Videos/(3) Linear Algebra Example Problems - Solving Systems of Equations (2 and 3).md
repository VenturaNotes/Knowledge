	- Solve the following system of equations:
	- Strategy is the same. Will use augmented matrix and row operations
	- Ideally we'd like to get it down to [[reduced row echelon form]] matrix 
	- When 0 = -9, that's a [[contradiction]]
		- Encountered a contradiction when doing row operations
		- This means system of equations has no solution
			- Meaning that the system of equations is [[inconsistent]]
