	- The matrix-vector product Ax
		- In Ax
			- A is a matrix
			- x is a vector
		- 3x3 matrix has 3 rows and 3 columns
		- 3x1 matrix has 3 rows and 1 column
			- For Ax to be defined, the interior dimensions need to matched
				- When doing multiplication of a matrix times a vector or a matrix times a matrix or a vector times a vector, the interior dimensions have to match.
				- Number of columns in "A" equals the number of rows in "x"
					- Tells us that this quantity is properly defined
					- Can actually compute what Ax is.
			- Outer dimensions tell us the final size
		- Computed Matrix-vector product Ax for this example
			- Final answer is $3\times 1$ 
	- Second example not possible because interior dimensions is not matched so Ax is undefined. Can't do this matrix-vector multiplication
	- Third example is possible
		- When we know it's defined, it's easy to compute because you let each column of "A" get multiplied by each element of "x"
