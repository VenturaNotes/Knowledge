	- Will work with a [[vector space]] for this example and will find the [[basis]] for a vector space.
		- This means any element form the vector space, I can write as a linear combination of the [[basis vectors]]
	- Consider the set of vectors: (in image)
	- Is this set of vectors a basis for $\mathbb{R}^3$ 
		- $\mathbb{R}^3$: This is the collection of all vectors of length 3
		- If this set is a basis of $\mathbb{R}^3$, then any vector from $\mathbb{R}^3$ can be written as a linear combination of these three things. 
			- So we're figuring out if this provided collection of vectors a [[basis]] for $\mathbb{R^3}$
