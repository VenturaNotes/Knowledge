	- [[Matrix multiplication]]
		- Going to think about it differently in terms of the row product rule 
		- $AB = [Ab_1 \space Ab_2 \space ... \space Ab_p]$
			- We have matrix A times an $n \times 1$ vector 
				- This is for $Ab_1$ so we would get an $m \times 1$ vector
		- Another way of thinking of a matrix product is to stack up all the vectors to form a matrix product
