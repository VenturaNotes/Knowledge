	- [[Homogeneous system of equations]]
		- When finding a solution to the equation, it's easy because you could let $x_1, x_2, x_3$ all equal 0
		- Would like to see if there is more than just this trivial solution to the equations
	- We've been looking at the form $ax=b$ 
	- A homogeneous system of equations is simply that same equation but with a b equal to the all zero vector
	- We find 2 basic variables (because of 2 pivots in first and second column) and 1 free variable making $x_3$ free
	- We found a family of solutions (an infinite number of them). For every value of $x_3$, we can compute $x_1$ and $x_2$ and write down a particular solution. 
	- So working with homogeneous systems of equations are not any different than working with our regular systems of equations. We know there will be at least the trivial solution because $x_1,x_2,x_3$ being zero will always be a solution. We're usually interested though in finding the full solution of the system of equations
