## (1) Linear Systems
### (1.1) Solving Linear Systems
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-08 at 6.54.45 PM.png]]
	- “Both examples come down to solving a system of equations.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=12&annotation=FCN5TQ5L))
		- “equations involve only the first power of each variable.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=12&annotation=BHGPPWQZ))
		- Examples
			- “the [[moment]] of an object is its mass times its distance from the balance point.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=11&annotation=W3ARKAVD))
				- “The first example is from [[Statics]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=11&annotation=VAL9AZZA))
			- “trinitrotoluene is better known as [[TNT]]” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=11&annotation=8E97C448))
				- “In what proportion should we mix them?” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=11&annotation=QN82VVM2))
#### (1.1.1) Gauss's Method
##### Definitions and Examples
- [[Gauss's Method]]
	- Definition
		- A [[linear combination]] of $x_1, ..., x_n$ has the form $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n$ where the numbers $a_1, ...,a_n$ $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$ are the combination's [[coefficients]].
		- A [[linear equation]] in the variables $x_1, ..., x_n$ has the form $a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + ... + a_nx_n = d$, where d $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$ is the [[constant]]
		- An [[n-tuple]] $(s_1, s_2,...,s_n) \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">solution</mark> of, or <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">satisfies</mark>, that equation if substituting the numbers $s_1, ..., s_n$ for the variables gives a true statement $a_1s_1 + a_2s_2 + ... + a_ns_n = d$.
		- A [[system of linear equations]] has the solution $(s_1,s_2,...,s_n)$ if that n-tuple is a solution of all of the equations

- 1.2 Example
	- Linear
		- $3x_1 + 2x_2$ 
	- Nonlinear
		- $3x^2_1 + 2x_2$
		- $3x_1 + 2sin(x_2)$
	- “We usually take x1, . . . , xn to be unequal” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=12&annotation=VMIY77FQ))
	- “sometimes include terms with a zero coefficient” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=12&annotation=WCNS9WYS))
		- Or omit them depending on convenience
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-08 at 9.18.34 PM.png]]
	- 1.3 Example
		- “Finding the set of all solutions is solving the system.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=13&annotation=F93IKDJA))
			- Algorithm that always works is [[Gauss's Method]]
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-08 at 9.25.03 PM.png]]
	- 1.4 Example
		- Solution set is {(3, 1, 3)}
		- “Gauss’s Method never loses solutions nor does it ever pick up extraneous solutions” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=13&annotation=VHXMR6BH))
- 1.5 Theorem (Gauss's Method)
	- If a linear system is changed to another by one of these operations, then the two systems have the same set of solutions
		- (1) “(1) an equation is swapped with another” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=14&annotation=B5RAYTV6))
			- “disallow swapping a row with itself, to make some results in the fourth chapter easier.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=14&annotation=IX6K3ASE))
		- “(2) an equation has both sides multiplied by a nonzero constant” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=14&annotation=W3UYXC39))
			- Can't multiply a row by 0
		- “(3) an equation is replaced by the sum of itself and a multiple of another” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=14&annotation=AXC44KC2))
			- “adding a multiple of a row to itself is not allowed” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=14&annotation=MZMR4NX3))
	- “equation swap operation” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=14&annotation=SFIB3TP9)) proof
		- Given a linear system, the tuple satisfies the system only if substituting the values for the variables gives a conjunction of true statements. Since we can rearrange the order statements joined with "and" as [[Conjunction|conjunctions]] are commutative [^1], the truth value is preserved of the resulting proposition
- 1.6 Definition ^e4e628
	- Three operations from Theorem 1.5
		- [[Gaussian operations]]
			- (1) Swapping
			- (2) Multiplying by a scalar (or rescaling)
			- (3) row combination
	- “we will abbreviate ‘row i’ by ‘$\rho$i’” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=15&annotation=LX5KRPPW))
		- Greek letter [[rho]]
	- “we will denote a row combination operation by kρi + ρj, with the row that changes written second.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=15&annotation=WHVNMESU))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-09 at 8.56.05 AM.png]]
	- 1.7 Example of [[Gauss's Method]]
- 1.8 Example
	- Physics problem solved
		- “So c = 4, and back-substitution gives that h = 1.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=15&annotation=V56UYL3K))
- 1.9 Example
	- “point of Gauss’s Method is to use the elementary reduction operations to set up [[back-substitution]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=16&annotation=AMG8844D))
- 1.10 Definition
	- “In each <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">row</mark> of a system, the first variable with a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">nonzero coefficient</mark> is the row’s [[leading variable]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=16&annotation=RXUECHR6))
	- “A system is in [[echelon form]] if each leading variable is to the right of the leading variable in the row above it, except for the leading variable in the first row, and any rows with all-zero coefficients are at the bottom.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=16&annotation=9H4KS475))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-09 at 9.02.37 AM.png]]
	- 1.11 Example of [[echelon form]]
		- “Strictly speaking, to solve linear systems we don’t need the row rescaling operation.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=17&annotation=C8SLC8WC))
			- Introduced it because of “[[Gauss-Jordan Method]]” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=17&annotation=TJXBYW2F))
				- This is a variation of Gauss's Method
		- All systems shown so far have only one solution. Also they have the same number of equations as unknowns
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-09 at 9.08.31 AM.png]]
	- 1.12 Example (System has more equations than variables)
		- 0=0 just reflects the redundancy
		- “some linear systems do not have a [[unique solution]]. This can happen in two ways. The first is that a system can fail to have any solution at all.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=17&annotation=APL89IHV))
		- This system is [[consistent]]
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-09 at 9.10.07 AM.png]]
	- 1.13 Example (no solution)
		- Solution set empty since 0 $\ne$ 2
		- This system is [[inconsistent]]
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-09 at 9.13.09 AM.png]]
	- 1.14 Example (inconsistent system due to no solution)
		- “inconsistency has to do with the interaction of the left and right sides” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=18&annotation=EAV8QCNH))1.
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-09 at 9.15.15 AM.png]]
	- 1.15 Example (solution set is infinite)
		- “<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">a 0 = 0 equation is not the signal that a system has many solutions.</mark>” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=18&annotation=228TDDGB))
- 1.16 Example (0=0)
	- “The absence of a 0 = 0 equation does not keep a system from having many different solutions.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=18&annotation=DHESIPFY))
	- $$ \begin{align*} x + y + z &= 0 \\ y + z &= 0 \end{align*}  $$
		- “any triple whose first component is 0 and whose second component is the negative of the third is a solution” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=18&annotation=AH3WBWUF))
			- This system has infinitely many solutions
				- Although it does have 3 unknowns but 2 equations
	- “the presence of 0 = 0 does not mean that the system must have many solutions.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/TGUR9253?page=18&annotation=GPH8D598)) ^112812
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-09 at 9.55.16 AM.png]]
			- No solution despite it has a 0 = 0 row
- Summary for [[Gauss's Method]]
	- [[No solutions]]
		- If any step shows a contradictory equation
	- [[Unique Solution]]
		- Echelon form without a contradictory solution
		- Each variable is a leading variable in its row
	- [[Many solutions]]
		- Echelon form without a contradictory equation
		- At least one variable not a leading variable (no unique solution)
##### Exercises
- [Solutions](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RHHYDIAW?page=9&annotation=BKR4CXA6)
- “If a system has a contradictory equation then it has [[no solution]]. Otherwise, if there are any variables that are not leading a row then it has[[ infinitely many solution]]. In the final case, where there is no contradictory equation and every variable leads some row, it has a [[unique solution]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/RHHYDIAW?page=9&annotation=66SN6GYS))
