	- [[Proof by deduction]] (it's about going through a logical sequence where you start with something you know to be true, and subsequently if that thing is true, then the next thing is true, and if that's true, then the next thing is true, and if that's true, then our conjecture is true.)
		- Conjecture: "The sum of any two consecutive odd numbers is a multiple of 4"
			- We know any multiple of $2$ is an even number (so $2n$ (regardless of what $n$ is) will always be even)
			- We can make it odd by adding 1 to it 
			- Since $4(n+1)$ has a factor of 4, the result of this expression will be a multiple of 4. 
			- Conjecture is proved true
	- Will formulate a logical argument (algebraically or through words) to show conjecture is true.
