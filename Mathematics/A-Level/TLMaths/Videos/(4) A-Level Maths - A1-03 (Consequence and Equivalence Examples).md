	- If only one statement implies the other, we have a logical consequence
	- If both statements imply each other, then we have a logical equivalence.
	- Examples
		- The Object is a cube $\implies$ The object has six faces
			- If the object has 6 faces, it could be a cuboid (which is a rectangular prism) 
		- x = 29 $\implies$ x > 10
			- x > 10 does not imply x = 29. x could equal 17
		- $x^3 = x$ $\impliedby$ x = -1
			- If you factor the first statement, the possible solutions are 1, -1, and 0
		- Given n is a positive integer greater than 1
			- n is a prime number $\iff$ n has exactly 2 factors
