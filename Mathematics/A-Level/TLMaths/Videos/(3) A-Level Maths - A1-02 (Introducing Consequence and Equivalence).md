	- Logical consequence and equivalence
		- Using particular arrows allowing us to show that one thing implies another and perhaps vice versa
	- $a \implies b$
		- "a implies b"
	- $a \impliedby b$ 
		- "b implies a"
	- $a \iff b$
		- "a implies b and b implies a"
		- "a if and only if b"
		- "a iff b"
	- Examples
		- p is a prime number > 2 $\implies$ p is an odd number
		- $n^2$ is odd $\iff$ n is odd
