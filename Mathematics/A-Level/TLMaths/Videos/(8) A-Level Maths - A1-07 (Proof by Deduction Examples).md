	- [[Proof by deduction]]
		- (1) For any four consecutive integers, the difference between the product of the last two and the product of the first two of these numbers is equal to their sum
			- This is true (showing it algebraically)
		- (2) $k^3 - k$ is divisible by 6 for all integers $k > 1$
			- Given the product of 3 consecutive integers: $(k - 1) \times k \times (k + 1)$
				- In 3 consecutive integers, at least one will be even so $k^3-k$ must be divisible by 2
				- In 3 consecutive integers, one must be a multiple of 3 so $k^3 - k$ must be divisible by 3
				- And since a product of integers will always be an integer which is divisible by 2 and 3, this means that $k^3-k$ must be divisible by 6
			- Went from an algebraic expression to a worded logical argument.
