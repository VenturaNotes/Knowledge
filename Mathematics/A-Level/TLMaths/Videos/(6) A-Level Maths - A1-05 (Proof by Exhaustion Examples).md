	- Examples
		- (1) "No square number ends in 8"
		- (2) "If n is an integer and 2 $\le$ n $\le$ 7, then A = $n^2$ + 2 is not divisible by 4"
			- Go through each iteration of 2, 3, 4, 5,6, and 7
		- (3) "Every integer that is a perfect cube is either a multiple of 9, is 1 more than a multiple of 9, or is 1 less than a multiple of 9"
	- (1)
		- Just squaring each unit digit, the last digit (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). None of them will end in an 8
	- (2)
		- Just created a table of $\mathbb{Z}$ from $2 \le n \le 7$ and showed that $A = n^2 + 2$ in each case is not divisible by 4
			- Proves original conjecture
