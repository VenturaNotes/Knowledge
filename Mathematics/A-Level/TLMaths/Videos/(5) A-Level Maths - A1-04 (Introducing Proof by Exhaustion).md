	- Conjecture: "97 is a prime number"
	- Proof by exhaustion: Must try all possible variations in order to prove a statement is true
	- Conjecture: Statement that we believe to be correct which needs to be proved
	- Don't need to try every positive integer
		- Since we showed 2 is not a factor of 97, any multiple of 2 would also not be a factor. $\therefore$ we would not need to show the multiples of 2 such as 4,6,8
		- Because the square root of 97 is less than 10, that means once we go beyond 10, if we were to find a factor above 10, then we would've needed a factor less than 10 in order to multiply with to make 97
			- As there are no factors > $\sqrt {97}$ $\implies$ there are no factors > $\sqrt {97}$ 
				- There will be no 'pair' greater than the square root
					- 91/7 = 13 so 7 is a factor. It's 'pair' is 13.
