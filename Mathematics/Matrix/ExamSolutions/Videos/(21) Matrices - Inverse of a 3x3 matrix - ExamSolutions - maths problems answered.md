	- [[Inverse of 3x3 matrix]]
	- If A is a 3$\times$ 3 matrix and |A| $\ne$ 0 then $A^{-1}$ = $\frac {1}{|A|}$ ADJ(A) where ADJ(A) = $A_{COF}^T$
		- ADJ means [[adjoint]] of matrix A
			- This is the [[cofactor]] of A [[Transpose|transposed]]
	- Minors
	- Determinant of matrix
	- Transposition
	- Cofactors of matrix
	- Can do this on the Casio ClassWiz which is a calculator
	- Identity matrix has a diagonal of 1s and the others elements are 0s
