	- To find inverse of 3x3 matrix,
		- Find minors of each element (of matrix A)
		- Find cofactor of A (transpose it)
		- Then multiply that by 1 over determinant of A
		- This will given inverse of A in the end.
	- Using Casio ClassWiz calculator to get the inverse of a 3x3 matrix
		- Menu Setup 
		- 4
		- 1 
		- 3 for number of rows 
		- 3 for number of columns 
		- Fill matrix with elements given
		- Option Button
		- 3 (matrix calculations)
		- 3 (for MatA)
		- Select $x^{-1}$
		- $=$ (get the inverse matrix)
			- Either gives us as decimal or we get the exact fraction
