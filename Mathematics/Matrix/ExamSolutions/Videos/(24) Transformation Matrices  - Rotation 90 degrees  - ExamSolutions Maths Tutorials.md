	- Rotation of $90\degree$, centre the origin
		- Goes anticlockwise
	- The [[transformation matrix]] is 
		- $\begin{bmatrix}0 & -1\\ 1 & 0\end{bmatrix}$
			- This matrix will transform any shape as a rotation 90$\degree$ center the origin
			- Created by considering the movements of the unit vectors (1, 0) and (0, 1)
	- [[Image matrix]] (image of the shape we had before)
		- $\begin{bmatrix}-1 & -3 & -1\\ 2 & 2 & 3\end{bmatrix}$
