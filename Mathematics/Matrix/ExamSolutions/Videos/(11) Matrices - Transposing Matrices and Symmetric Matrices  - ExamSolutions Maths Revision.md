	- [[Transpose]] (doesn't need to be a square matrix)
		- First row becomes first column
		- Second row becomes second column
		- Third row becomes third column
	- The transpose of a matrix of dimension $m\times n$ has dimension $n \times m$
	- If $A = A^{T}$, then the matrix A is said to be [[symmetric]]
		- So if A is symmetric, then we expect the matrix to be square, and there would be a reflection of elements across the leading diagonal
