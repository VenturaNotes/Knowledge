	- (1) A rotation of $270 \degree$, centre (0, 0)
	- (2) An enlargement scale factor -2, centre (0, 0)
	- (3) A reflection in the x-axis
	- (4) A rotation of $90\degree$, center(0,0)
	- (5) A stretch scale factor 2, parallel to the y-axis with the x-axis as [[invariant]]
		- If x-axis invariant, the vector 1,0 is still going to remain at 1,0
			- Any points on that axis stays the same
	- (6) A reflection in the line y=x
	- (7) An enlargement scale factor 1.5, centre (0, 0)
	- (8) A rotation of -90$\degree$, center (0,0)
	- (9) A reflection in the y-axis
		- Any number on the y-axis would be invariant in this case

	- (10) A reflection in the line y = -x
	- (11) A rotation of 180$\degree$, center (0, 0)
	- (12) A stretch scale factor 3, parallel to the x-axis with the y-axis as invariant
