	- [[Identity Matrix]]
		- AI = IA = A
	- [[Inverse Matrix]]
		- [[Determinant]]
			- det(a)
				- Take [[Leading Diagonal|leading diagonal]] and subtract the [[Trailing Diagonal|trailing diagonal]]
				- ad - bc
			- If det(A) = 0 ([[Singular Matrix|singular matrix]]) ^df47cf
				- Then $A^{-1}$ does not exist
			- If det(A) $\ne$ 0, ([[Nonsingular Matrix|nonsingular matrix]])
				- Therefore, the inverse matrix will exist
		- Can use inverse matrices to solve simultaneous equations. Could also use it in transformations of shapes
