	- (1) Imagine two positive real numbers x and y represented by lengths of connected line segments
	- (2) Draw a semi-circle with diameter given by connected segments so radius of semi-circle is $\frac {x + y}{2}$
	- (3) Let z be the length of the half-[[chord]] from the point where x and y meet to the semi-circle.
	- (4) Connecting the ends of the diameter to the intersection of z on the circle yields a triangle. [[Thales's Theorem|Thales triangle theorem]] forces this triangle to be right-angled
