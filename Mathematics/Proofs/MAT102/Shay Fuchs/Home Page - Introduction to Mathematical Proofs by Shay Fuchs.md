## Preface
- “The notes are now much cleaner from misprints and other errors due to Sahid's helpful comments.” ([Fuchs, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/65FS5YSF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XPZ725WL?page=6&annotation=7E88IV74)) It seems like this text has not been thoroughly reviewed aside from colleagues and a special student

### (1.1) The Quadratic Formula
- “We therefore start by properly stating a theorem on quadratic equations, and then present a proof using the completing the square" method.” ([Fuchs, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/65FS5YSF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XPZ725WL?page=7&annotation=CBFU5UQ9))

	- Theorem 1.1.1 (The Quadratic Formula). Let a, b, c be three real numbers, with a $\ne$ 0. Then the equation $ax^2 + bx + c = 0$ has...
		- (a) No real solutions if $b^2 - 4ac < 0$
			- This makes sense because you would get imaginary numbers then.
		- (b) A unique solution if $b^2 - 4ac = 0$, given by $x=-\frac{b}{2a}$
			- This just means you will get 0 as the radicand (which is the identity property of addition and subtraction)
		- (c) Two distinct solutions if $b^2-4ac > 0$, given by $x=\frac{-b + \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$ and  $x=\frac{-b - \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}$
			- This is because there will be a number which will not satisfy the identity property
	- “For now, a real number is any number on the number line (including whole numbers, negative numbers, fractions, etc.).” ([Fuchs, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/65FS5YSF)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/XPZ725WL?page=7&annotation=Z238SF2T))
