	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives (for this video)
		- By the end of this video, participants should be able to:
			- (1) Define basic terms about [[set|sets]]
			- (2) Define a set using [[set-builder notation]]
			- (3) Distinguish between $\theta$ and {$\theta$}
			- (4) Prove that two sets are equal using the "[[double subset technique]]"
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- Motivation 1
			- Sets are a playground to experiment with proof techniques
		- Motivation 2
			- Sets are a fundamental way of encoding math. We can encode lists, numbers and functions from only sets
	- Slide 4 - Sets
		- "Definition" ([[Set]])
			- A set is an un-ordered collection of objects (where repeats are not considered). (Other names, Set, collection, family)
		- Examples
		- Observations
			- (1) Order doesn't matter
				- In a [[list]], the order matters
			- (2) Repeats don't matter 
			- (3) Sets can contain objects of any type (including other sets!)
	- Slide 5 - [[members|elements]]
		- Definition $(x \in A)$ 
			- If x is an object, and A is a set, we say x $\in$ A if x is an element (or member) of A. We say y $\notin$ A if y is not an element of A
		- Examples
		- Convention
			- We prefer to use upper case letters (A, B, C, X, Y) for sets, and lower case letters (a, b, c, x, y) for elements
	- Slide 6 - [[Subsets]]
		- Definition (subset)
			- Let A, B be sets. We say that A $\subseteq$ B if and only if $(\forall x)[x \in A \implies x \in B]$ 
		- Examples
			- $\mathbb{N}$ $\subseteq$ $\mathbb{Z}$ $\subseteq \mathbb{Q} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$ 
		- Non-examples
		- Need to be careful about [[quantifiers]]. If something is a subset, you need to show for all x some implication happens. To show something is not a subset, a [[negation]] for a [[for all]] statement is a [[It exists|there exists]] statement
		- Negation of A $\subseteq B$
			- $\lnot(A \subseteq B) \text{ means } (\exists x)[x \in A \land x \lnot B]$

	- Slide 7 - [[Lemmas]] about subsets
		- Lemmas
			- Let A, B, C be sets
		- Exercise: Prove these two statements directly (by [[definition unwinding]])
			- #archive
	- Slide 8 - Exercise
		- Exercise
			- How many elements does the set B = {0, 1, A} have?
		- This problem will be continued in the next video
