	- Slide 2 - Learning Objective (for this video)
		- By the end of this video, participants should be able to
			- Identify plausible set identities
			- Identify plausible locations for counterexamples to a false set identity
			- Prove a [[set identity]] using the [[double subset technique]]
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- Motivation
			- How can we identify when a set identity is true or false?
		- Which of the following statements are true for all sets A, B, C?
	- Slide 4 - [[Counterexample]]
		- Idea: Use a diagram to help us find why they are not the same, and where to find a counterexample
			- A diagram on its own is not a proof
	- Slide 5 - [[double subset technique|Double subset]]
		- Theorem
			- For all sets A, B, C we have A $\times$ (B $\cup$ C) = (A $\times$ B) $\cup$ (A $\times$ C)
				- You can distribute the [[cartesian product]] across [[Union|unions]]
		- Example of [[definition unwinding]] proof
			- Using the logical identity $P \land (Q \lor R) \equiv (P \land Q) \lor (P \land R)$
				- This is known as the [[distributive law]]
		- The $\supseteq$ direction is an exercise for you

	- Slide 6 - Set identity using iff
		- [[DeMorgan's Laws|DeMorgan's Law]] for sets
			- For sets A, B, C we have A $\backslash$ (B $\cup$ C) = (A $\backslash$ B) $\cap$ (A $\backslash$ C)
				- If you subtract a union, it becomes the intersection of two subtractions
			- Definition of [[intersection]]
				- $x \in (A \backslash B) \cap (A \backslash C)$ is equivalent to $x \in (A \backslash B) \land (x \in A \backslash C$)
			- Unwind definition of [[Difference of sets|set difference]]
			- We know that P $\equiv$ P $\land$ P by [[Idempotent Laws]]
			- P $\land$ Q $\equiv$ Q $\land$ P is true by [[Commutative Laws|commutative law]]
		- Used many logic identities
	- Slide 7 - Reflection
		- How are set identities related to identities in logic?
		- What is a way to search for a counterexample systematically, and not randomly?
		- What set identity corresponds to the logic identity A $\backslash$ (B $\cap$ C) = (A $\backslash$ B) $\cup$ (A $\backslash$ C)
