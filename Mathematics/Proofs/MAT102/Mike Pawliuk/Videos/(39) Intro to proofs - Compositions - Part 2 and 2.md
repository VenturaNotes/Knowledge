	- Slide 8 - Functions and Compositions
		- This is a fundamental result in math. Look for it in every math course
		- Theorem
			- The composition of any two injections is an [[injection]]
			- The composition of any two surjections is a [[surjection]]
			- The composition of any two bijections is a [[bijection]]
			- Secret for now
		- Proof of 1 is an important exercise
	- Slide 9 - (4) The composition of any two surjections is a surjection
	- Slide 10 - Secret Theorem (Socks and shoes)
		- [[inverse]]
			- $(g \circ f)^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}$ 
	- Slide 11 - Secret Theorem (Socks and Shoes)
		- Theorem
			- Let $f: A \to B$ and $g: B \to C$ be bijections. Then $(g \circ f)^{-1}$ = $f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}$

	- Slide 12 - Reflection
		- Does the order in which you compose functions matter?
		- For $g \circ f$, why do we need ran(f) $\subseteq$ dom(g)?
			- g composed with f
		- How do socks and shoes relate to inverse functions?
