	- Slide 9 - [[Sum Theorems]]
		- Let c be a real number, and n be a natural number
		- You can factor constant outside of sum (2nd problem)
		- Exercise: If m $\le$ n then
			- $\Sigma_{i=m}^n1 = n-m$  (maybe?)
			- $\Sigma_{i=m}^n1 = n-m+1$ (for programming?)
	- Slide 10 - [[Product notation]]
		- Errata
			- Upper index for the example should be 4, not n
		- Definition (Pi notation)
			- Let $a_i$ be a real number (for i $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$ and let n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$)
			- $\Pi_{i=1}^na_i$ 
				- $a_i$ is a real number
				- n is the stopping index
				- Product is what you'd expect
				- i is dummy variable
				- 1 is start
	- Slide 11 - Brain melting
		- Exercise. Write the for loop that produce product
			- [[empty sum]]
			- [[empty product]]
				- When initializing a product, you initialize it to 1 and then add things onto it
		- This is one reason why $0! = 1$ and $x^0 = 1$ 
	- Slide 12 - [[Product Theorems]]
		- Let c be a real number, and n be a natural number

	- Slide 13 - End boss
		- Compute
	- Slide 14 - Reflection
		- How do you recognize the dummy variable, the starting index, the end index and the terms you are adding?
		- What are the similarities and differences between sum notation and product notation?
		- How is sum notation like a for loop in programming?
