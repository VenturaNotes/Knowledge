	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives (for this video)
		- By the end of this video, participants should be able to:
			- Produce the [[inverse]] of a simple function
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- Motivation
			- We know that $x^2$ and $\sqrt{x}$ are "inverse" functions because they "undo" each other
			- What does this mean precisely? How do we find [[inverse function|Inverse Functions]]? When do inverse functions exist?
	- Slide 4 - Definition
		- Definition
			- Let f: $A \to B$ be a [[bijection]]. The inverse of f is the function g: $B \to A$ that assigns to any b $\in$ B the unique a $\in$ A such that f(a) = b
			- Denote this g as $f^{-1}$ 
		- Note 1
			- f(a) = b $\iff$ $f^{-1}(b) = a$
		- Note 2
			- $f^{-1}(f(a)) = a$ for all a $\in$ $A$
			- $f^{-1}(f(b)) = b$ for all b $\in$ $B$
		- Two most important parts of inverse
			- They undo the functions
			- You can define one from the other
	- Slide 5 - (2) Examples
		- Errata
			- It should be $f^{-1}(x) = \sqrt{x}$ 
		- Question: Why did we restrict the domain of $x^2$ to $[0, \infty)$?
		- Answer: So that it would pass the [[horizontal line test]] (HLT), and its inverse would pass the [[vertical line test]] (VLT) and be a function

	- Slide 6 - (2) Examples
		- $e^x$ and $lnx$ are inverses of each other
	- Slide 7 - (3) When does a [[function]] have a [[inverse]]
		- A function needs to pass the HLT for its inverse to pass the VLT
			- Passing the HLT means it's an [[injection]]
		- A function needs to reach all values in B in order for its inverse to be defined on all of B
			- Meaning it needs to be a [[surjection]]
		- [[Theorem]]
			- Let f: A $\to$ B be a function. The following are equivalent
				- f is one-to-one and f is onto
				- $f^{-1}$ exists and is defined on all of B
		- Inverses exist for bijections
	- Slide 8 - (4) More examples
		- Example 2
			- Will use arrow notation
