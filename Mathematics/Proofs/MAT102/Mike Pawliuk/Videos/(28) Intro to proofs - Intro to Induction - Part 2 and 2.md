	- Slide 9 - (3) Mathematical induction
		- Proof strategy ([[Regular induction]])
		- To prove a statement of the form "($\forall$n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$)$[P(n)]$"
			- You can show that
				- P(1) is true, and
				- $\forall n$ $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$, (P(n) $\implies$ P(n+1)).  
		- P(1) is called the [[base case]]
		- P(n) $\implies$ P(n+1) is called the [[induction step]]
		- P(n) is called the [[induction hypothesis]] (IH)
	- Slide 10 - (5) Example
		- Since it is a statement of natural numbers, we can prove by induction
		- [[Theorem]]
			- $\forall$ n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$, 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = $\frac {n(n+1)}{2}$ 
		- Proof
			- [[base case]]
	- Slide 11 - (5) Example
		- Proof
			- [[Induction step]]
			- [[induction hypothesis]]
	- Slide 12 - (5). Example, examined
		- "for this particular n" is more to emphasize for students
		- What's shown is what's essential for the proof

	- Slide. 13 - Reflection
		- How is induction like knocking over a stack of dominos?
		- What are the essential features of induction?
		- Why did we emphasize that the inductive hypothesis is "P(n), for one particular n"?
