	- Slide 8 - Pros and Cons of proof by contradiction
		- Pros:
			- It gives you two things to work with (P and $\lnot$ Q)
			- Often the proofs are short
		- Cons
			- The proofs are not [[constructive]] (e.g. Euclid's proof does not tell you how to make large prime numbers)
			- It's not always clear what contradiction to aim for
			- It can make messy / confusing proofs
	- Slide 9 - What technique should I use?
		- [[Direct]] Is good for "definition unwinding" proofs
		- [[Contrapositive]]: Very similar to direct, but when $\lnot Q$ and $\lnot P$ are easier to work with. (e.g. x + y = 0 is easier to work with than x + y $\ne 0$)
		- [[Contradiction]]: Good for statements of the form "no weird things exist" (If the things are sufficiently weird, then assuming it exists should produce a contradiction)
		- Exercise: What technique should you use to prove these statements?
			- $\sqrt{2}$ is irrational: 
				- Contradiction
			- Direct
			- Contrapositive
	- Slide 10 - Reflection
		- What types of proofs are constructive, and which are non-constructive?
		- What are the advantages and disadvantages of both?
		- What are some reasons why you might want to use proof by contradiction?
