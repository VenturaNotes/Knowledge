	- Slide 9 - (4) More examples
		- The function h is a [[bijection]]
		- Showed [[injection|one-to-one]]
	- Slide 10 - (4) More examples
		- Showed [[inverse]]
	- Slide 11 - (4) More examples
		- Showed function is [[surjection|onto]]
			- Part of work for finding inverse is helpful for showing it's onto
	- Slide 12 - Reflection
		- What is the role of the HLT and VLT in finding the inverse of a function?
		- What is the difference between $f(f^{-1}(y))$ and $f^{-1}(f(x))$
		- How does finding the [[inverse]] of a function relate to showing that it is [[surjection|surjective]]?
