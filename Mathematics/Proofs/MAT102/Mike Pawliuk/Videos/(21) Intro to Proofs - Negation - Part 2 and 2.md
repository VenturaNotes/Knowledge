	- Slide 11 - Examples
		- Example
			- Negate these statements and then decide which is true: the original statement or the negation 
	- Slide 12 - Example 1
		- $\equiv$ is the symbol to show that two statements are [[logically equivalent]]
			- You could use equal signs "=" but not a super big deal. If someone is being pedantic, someone will say it should be logically equivalent and not equals
		- Negation is true
	- Slide 13 - Example 2
		- Negation is false
	- Slide 14 - Example 3 - Multiple Quantifiers
		- Pull negation symbol through one step at a time
		- Errata: There should be iff in this example (as they're logically equivalent)
		- For the second part, you choose the y and it can depend on the x

	- Slide 15 - End Boss
		- End boss exercise. Negate the following statement
			- Hint: You have all the tools you need to conquer this boss. Go slowly!
		- It is a calculus definition
	- Slide 16 - Reflection
		- Do you prefer to negate statements formally (using the process described here), or informally by "just thinking about it"?
		- Negate $P_1$ $\land$ $P_2$ $\land$ $P_3$ 
		- How is [[DeMorgan's Laws|DeMorgan's Law]] related to universal and existential statements?
