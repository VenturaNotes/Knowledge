	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives (for this video)
		- By the end of this vide, participants should be able to:
			- (1) Identify a type of statement that could be proved by [[induction]]
			-  (2) Produce the structure of a proof by induction
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- Motivation
			- Induction is a powerful proof technique that allows us to prove results about objects with [[self-similarity]] and [[symmetry]]. We will see many variations on it in this course
	- Slide 4 - (1) Warm-up
		- Observation. We can get from one equation to the next without re-computing everything
	- Slide 5 - (2) Motivating Question
		- For a natural number n, let P(n) be the statement

	- Slide 6 - (2) Motivating Question
		- Idea of Induction
			- (1) Show that P(1) is true
			- (2) Show that P(n) $\implies$ P(n+1), for every n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$
		- Important Note: Part 2 is not saying: ($\forall$ n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$)$[P(n)]$. It's saying "you can always move up one step".
			- Just because an implication is true does not mean the conclusion is always true. You need the first part as well
	- Slide 7 - (2) Motivating Example
		- Theorem:
			- $\forall$n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$(P(n) $\to$ P(n+1))
		- Proving a [[for all]] statement
			- Need to pick an arbitrary n
