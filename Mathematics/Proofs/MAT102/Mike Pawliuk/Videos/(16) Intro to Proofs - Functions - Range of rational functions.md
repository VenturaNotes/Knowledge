	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives (for this video)
		- By the end of this video, participants should be able to
			- Compute the [[range]] of a [[rational function]] f : $\mathbb{R}$ $\to$ $\mathbb{R}$, and prove that it is correct
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- Motivation
			- Now that we are able to manipulate [[inequality|inequalities]], we return to functions to compute ranges of rational functions. These functions often show up in calculus, but we will make these computations without calculus
	- Slide 4 - Review
		- [[Domain (Math)|domain]], [[codomain]], [[range]] (all outputs of function), [[image]] (pouring subset of domain in function to get image of C under f)
	- Slide 5 - Warm up example
		- Warm up for proving range of rational function

	- Slide 6 - Continued
		- For most n, you might get two "x"s that work. Since we're trying to show that it's in the range, it's enough to find one x that works. Being in the range means there is an x that outputs. It doesn't matter how many there are
	- Slide 7 - Proof strategy
		- Proof strategy showing C = ran(f)
			- To show that C = ran(f) you need to show [[double subset technique|double subset]]
				- (1) ran(f) $\subseteq{C}$. This means showing that every f(x) is in C
				- (2) C $\subseteq$ ran(f). This means that every c $\in$ C can be written as f(x) = c. It is your job to find one x that works
	- Slide 8 - An example with a [[rational function]]
		- The statement after Note will be explained later
	- Slide 9 - Example continued
		- Showed that ran(f) is a subset of the interval

	- Slide 10 - Example Continued
		- [[Quadratic formula]]
	- Slide 11 - Reflection
		- What is the difference between showing ran(f) $\subseteq$ C and showing C $\subseteq$ ran(f)
		- What role did the quadratic equation play in the previous example?
		- How would you have written up your explanation of the previous example?
