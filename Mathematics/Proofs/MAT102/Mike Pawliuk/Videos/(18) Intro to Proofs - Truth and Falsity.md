	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives (for this video)
		- By the end of this video, participants should be able to:
			- (1) Translate an English sentence into a precise mathematical statement
			- (2) Translate a mathematical statement (using all the [[connectives]]) into English
			- (3) Give the truth values for the connectives (and, or, if/then, not)
			- (4) Explain why "False implies True" is true
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- Motivation
			- We want to be able to communicate mathematics precisely, without misunderstandings
		- Examples
			- not
			- and
			- or
			- if then
			- if and only if
	- Slide 4 - [[Not]] (Negations)
		- We use P, Q, R to denote mathematical statements. (e.g. P: "For all x $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$, x < x + 1.") "T" means "True" and "F" means "False"
		- not, $\lnot$ 
			- $\lnot$P means "The negation of P". (Imprecisely: the "opposite" statement)
	- Slide 5 - [[And]] (Conjunctions)
		- and, $\land$
			- P $\land$ Q means "Both P and Q are true"

	- Slide 6 - [[Or]] (Disjunctions)
		- or, $\lor$ 
			- P $\lor$ Q means "P is true or Q is true (possibly both)."
		- Note. In math "or" can include both things. It is "inclusive"
	- Slide 7 - If/then ([[Implication|implications]])
		- If/then, $\implies$ 
			- P $\implies$ Q means "If P is true, then Q is also true"
		- Example. P: "You get an A in the intro to proofs course", Q: "You will pass the intro to proofs course"
		- Scenario: At the beginning of the course, the instructors promises you "If you get an A in the course, then you will pass the course." (P $\implies$ Q). What circumstances would have to happen for you to call the instructor a liar?
		- The reason why P $\to$ Q is true when P is false and Q is true
			- If P is false, it doesn't say anything about the implication
	- Slide 8 - If and only if ([[equivalence]])
		- If and only if, $\iff$ 
			- P $\iff$ Q means "P is true if and only if Q is true". This is also denoted P iff Q
		- Basically saying that they have the same truth values
	- Slide 9 - Exercises
		- Translate the following sentences into pure math symbols
			- (1) x is even and x is a multiple of 5
			- (2) If x is a multiple of 6, then it is also a multiple of 3
			- (3) Every multiple of 6 is also a multiple of 3
			- (4) A real number is positive exactly when it is equal to the square of a non-zero real number
			- (5) p is a prime natural number

	- Slide 10 - Reflection
		- Why have we formally defined the connectives?
		- Why does the truth table for "and", "or", "if/then", "iff" have 4 rows, but the table for "not" has only two rows?
		- Why did we assume that mathematical statements can only be "True" or "False", and nothing in between?
		- How can the truth table for "and" be made to look like multiplication?
