	- Potential Errata
		- On slide 10 example 1, it doesn't seem true. The solution should be {1, 2, 3}
	- Slide 8 - Exercise
		- How many elements does the set B = {0, 1, A} have?
	- Slide 9 - [[Empty set]]
		- Definition (empty set)
			- The set without any elements is called the empty set, and is denoted $\theta$ 
		- Exercise
			- How many elements does the set B = {A} have?
		- Theorem
			- $\theta \ne \{\theta\}$ 
			- $\theta$ is a box with nothing in it
			- $\{\theta\}$ Is a box with a box with nothing in it
	- Slide 10 - [[Set-builder notation|Set Builder Notation]]
		- Definition (Set builder notation)
			- If A is a set, and P(x) is a property of x, then {x $\in$ A : P(x)} is the set of all x $\in$ A such that P(x) is true
		- Example
			- (1) This does not seem true. The solution should be {1, 2}
			- [[rational numbers]]
		- Important rewording
	- Slide 11 - [[Set Equality]]
		- Definition (A = B)
			- Let A, B be sets. We say A = B if A $\subseteq B$ and B $\subseteq A$ 
		- Proof technique (A = B)
			- To show A = B (where A, B are sets), you need to show
				- (1) A $\subseteq$ B, and
				- (2) B $\subseteq$ A
			- Known as the [[double subset technique]]
		- Alternate proof technique (A = B)
			- To show A = B (where A, B are sets), you can show
				- $x \in A \iff x \in B$ 
		- Warning: Avoid using the alternate technique if you are lazy, since you need to check that every $\iff$ is not just a $\implies$ 
	- Slide 12 - Exercises #archive
		- (1) Write out all elements of {x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$: $x^2 - 1 < 3$}
		- (2) Use the definition of subset to prove that {1, 2} $\subseteq$ {0, 1, 2, 3}
		- (3) Express the even integers using set-builder notation
		- (4) Let A be a set. Show that $\theta$ $\subseteq$ A
		- (5) Given an example of sets A, B such that A $\in$ B and A $\subseteq$ B are both true
	- Slide 13 - Reflection
		- What is the difference between x $\in$ A and A $\subseteq B$?
		- Think of a real life example of a set with a subset
		- Is it possible for A $\subseteq$ B and B $\subseteq$ A? What about x $\in$ A and A $\in$ x?
		- Is $\theta$ = {$\theta$}? Why or why not?
