	- Slide 1 - Introduction to Proofs - Sets - Constructions
	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives (for this video)
		- By the end of this video, participants should be able to
			- (1) Use [[interval notation]] to describe a set
			- (2) Give the definitions of set [[intersection]], [[union]], [[difference]], [[complement]] and [[product]]
			- (3) Identify mathematical statements involving intersection, union, difference, complement and product
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- Motivation 1
			- Intervals are important, simple subsets of $\mathbb{R}$
		- Motivation 2
			- We will construct new sets from old sets using common operations. (These will be related to the [[logical operations]] $\land$, $\lor$, $\implies$, etc.)
	- Slide 4 - [[Interval]] definitions
		- Definitions (Internvals)
			- [[Open interval]]
				- Exclude both endpoints
			- [[closed interval]]
				- Include both endpoints
			- [[half-open interval]]
				- one round bracket and one square bracket
			- [[open ray]]
				- If a side is positive or negative infinity
			- [[closed ray]]
				- If a side is positive or negative infinity
		- Note: Many other combinations are possible (open/closed, ray/interval, half, etc)
	- Slide 5 - [[Set Operations]]
		- We will go through five basic operations
			- [[Intersection]]
			- [[Union]]
			- [[Difference]]
			- [[Complement]]
			- [[Cartesian Product]]
	- Slide 6 - Intersection
		- Definition (Intersection)
			- Let A, B be sets. The intersection of A and B is defined as
			- Equivalently
		- Venn diagrams on their own are not proofs

	- Errata
		- In slide 10, it should be written for the example $[1, 2)$ 
	- Slide 7 - Special case of intersection
		- Special case
			- When A $\cap$ B = $\varnothing$, we say A and B are [[disjoint]]. (They don't share any elements)
			- Example: $\mathbb{N}$ and (-$\infty$, 0] are disjoint sets
	- Slide 8 - [[Union]]
		- Definition (union)
		- [[Set of integers]] = $\mathbb{N} \cup \{0\} \cup \{-n : n \in \mathbb{N}\}$ 
	- Slide 9 - Check-in
		- Which symbol is the [[Logical operators|logical operator]] $\land$ related to?
		- Which symbol is the logical operator $\lor$ related to?
	- Slide 10 - [[Difference]]
		- $A \backslash B$ is read as "A removed B" meaning all elements in A that are not in B
			- Another way to say it is "elements in A that are removed by B"
	- Slide 11 - [[Complement]]
		- Definition (complement)
			- Let A, U be sets. The complement of A (with respect to the [[universal set]] U) is defined as:
		- The complement of an interval should be inside the reals (even if it was not explicitly stated)
	- Slide 12 - [[Cartesian product]]
		- The cartesian product is a collection of pairs of elements
			- All examples previously were collections of points
			- The cartesian product is a higher dimension. First coordinate always from A and second coordinate always from B
		- By always taking a rank and suit. Will give all 52 combinations

	- Slide 13 - Cartesian products, part 2
		- Cartesian products show up in the xy plane
		- Exercise
			- Which of the following sets is (1,3) an element of?
				- Solution is all of them
	- Slide 14 - Reflection #archive
		- Is the intersection of two intervals always an interval? What about union? (Prove it.)
		- How can A $\backslash$ B be defined in terms of intersections, unions and complements?
		- Is A $\cup$ B = B $\cup$ A? What logical identity/fact does this amount to?
		- If A and B are finite, then find a formula for the number of elements of A $\times$ B
