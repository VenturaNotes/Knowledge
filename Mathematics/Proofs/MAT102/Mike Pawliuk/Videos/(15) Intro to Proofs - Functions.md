	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives (for this video)
		- By the end of this video, participants should be able to:
			- (1) Name and define the parts of a [[function]] ([[Domain (Math)|domain]], [[codomain]], [[range]]/[[image]])
			- (2) Represent a function using an [[arrow diagram]]
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- Motivation
			- [[Functions]] are basic objects that are closely related to [[sets]]. They appear everywhere in math
	- Slide 4 - Definition of a function
		- "Definition" (Function)
			- A function f: $A \to B$ is a "rule" (or "machine") that associates to every element a $\in$ A an element f(a) $\in$ B.
		- Input: Any point from A
		- Output: Any point from B
		- Non-example: An input going to two different places is not allowed for a function
	- Slide 5 - Notation
		- Definition ([[Domain (Math)|domain]], [[Codomain]])
			- If f: A $\to$ B is a function then A is called the domain and b is called the codomain of f
		- $\mathbb{R}$ $\backslash$ {1}
			- This is the domain of all real numbers not including / except one /

	- Slide 6 - [[arrow diagram|arrow diagrams]]
		- Example 2
		- Domain written on left side
		- Codomain written on right side
		- Helpful way to represent a function
	- Slide 7 - Codomain Example
		- Example
		- If domain is explicitly declared, that's the only thing allowed to be put into it
	- Slide 8 - Range
		- Definition ([[Range]])
			- If f: A $\to$ B is a function, then the range (or image) of f is {f(a): a $\in$ A}. Equivalently, y $\in$ ran(f) $\iff$ ($\exists a \in A)[y = f(a)]$
		- All possible outputs of function
		- Technical way of describing it
			- Y is in the range of f iff there is a point in the domain that outputs that y
		- To compute range, we need to see what the possible outputs of the function are
			- Range and codomain can be different
	- Slide 9 - Another example

	- Slide 10 - Image of a [[set]]
		- Definition ([[Image]])
			- If f : A $\to$ B is a function, and C $\subseteq$ A, then the image of C under f is the set
				- $f(C) = \{f(c): c \in C\}$
					- Error in video: It's not $\mathbb{C}$ 
				- We use the notation f(C) to denote all possible outputs (so bad notation on this part)
			- The image of a set can be different from its range
	- Slide 11 - Observations
		- Propositions
			- If f: $A \to B$ is a function, and C $\subseteq$ A, then
				- range is a subset of codomain
				- image is a subset of codomain
				- image is a subset of range
				- range equals the image of the domain
	- Slide 12 - Why use the codomain?
		- Observation
			- It can be useful to use a wider codomain if you don't know the complete function ahead of time. Computing an exact range is often difficult in practice
		- Example
			- You want to define a function Country(x) that takes as an input x a year in which the Olympics were held, and outputs the name of the country that won the most medals that year
				- codom(Country) = all countries in the world (including those that no longer exist)
				- ran(Country) = ... requires research to find out
	- Slide 13 - Reflection
		- What are the key parts of a function?
		- If a function is given to you as f : A $\to$ B, what two features can you identify already?
		- What is the difference between the codomain and range of a function
