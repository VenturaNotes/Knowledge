	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives (for this video)
		- By the end of this video, participants should be able to
			- Distinguish between explicit and recursive descriptions of sequences
			- Prove a statement about a recursively defined sequence using induction
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- Motivation
			- We want to describe a [[sequence]] of real numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, ...,$ "locally"
				- locally means if you have the 100th term, you want to describe the next term from it
				- When defining things locally, we want to depend on the things that are close to them
		- Motivation
			- [[Induction]] and [[recursion]] are two sides of the same coin. You use induction to prove statements about recursion
				- Induction is the proof technique
				- Recursion is the definition
	- Slide 4 - (1) Example
		- Recursively defined sequence
		- Two ways to compute a number
			- [[Recursive]]
			- [[Explicit]]
				- Explicit definition of sequence
	- Slide 5 - (2) Proof about recursive sequences
		- Theorem
			- For the sequence $a_n$ defined previously, $\forall n$ $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$ we have $a_n$ = $\frac {5^{n+1}- 1}{4}$

	- Slide 6 - (2) Proof about recursive sequences
		- [[induction step]]
	- Slide 7 - Multiple base cases
		- The [[fibonacci numbers]] ($F_n$) are
		- The "Fibonacci" numbers were not invented by Fibonacci. He introduced these numbers to Europe in his book [[Liber Abaci]]. You can listen to a podcast about this here: https://n.pr/2Pi9Cr6
			- Were well known already outside of Europe before that
	- Slide 8 - (3) Multiple base cases
		- Inductive step
	- Slide 9 - (3) Multiple base cases
		- [[base case]]
			- We have 2 of them in this case
		- We have 2 base cases because in our induction step, we made two induction hypothesis assumptions
		- When defining fibonacci numbers, we need two starting cases so we can go to the next one
