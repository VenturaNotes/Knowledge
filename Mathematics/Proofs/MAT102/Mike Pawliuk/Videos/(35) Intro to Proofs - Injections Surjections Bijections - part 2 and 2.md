	- Slide 12 - (5) Exercises
		- Exercise 1
			- Find a function f: $\mathbb{R}$ $\to$ $\mathbb{R}$ that is [[onto]], but not [[one-to-one]]
			- Find a function g : $\mathbb{R}$ $\to$ $\mathbb{R}$ that is one-to-one, but not onto
		- Exercise 2
			- Show that the polynomial p: $\mathbb{R}$ $\to$ $\mathbb{R}$ defined by p(x) = (x-1)(x-2) is not an injection
			- Prove that if a polynomial has more than one root, then it is not injective
			- Prove that even functions are not injective. (Def: $\forall$ x $\in$ dom(f) = $\mathbb{R}$, f(-x) = f(x))
			- Prove that any [[even]] degree [[polynomial]] will not be an [[injection]]
	- Slide 13 - (6) Functions as [[arrow diagram|arrow diagrams]]
		- Exercise 3
			- Write/find/draw four different arrow diagrams {1, 2, 3} $\to$ {4, 5, 6} as so that
				- One is a bijection
					- arrow diagram shown for this one
				- One is not injective
					- Two different things go to one thing
				- One is not a function
					- One thing goes to two things
				- One is not onto, but one is one-to-one (trick question)
	- Slide 14 - (7) Better definitions
		- Here f: A $\to$ B is a function
		- Theorem 1
			- The following are equivalent (TFAE)
				- f is [[one-to-one]]
				- $\forall a_1, a_2 \in A$: If $a_1 \ne a_2$, then $f(a_1) \ne f(a_2)$. 
					- $a_1 \ne a_2$ is happening in the domain
					-  $f(a_1)\ne f(a_2)$ is happening in the codomain (or range? might be wrong there)
					- ("f is two-to-two")
						-  Two different things in the domain gets sent to two different things in the codomain
				- $\forall a_1, a_2 \in A$: If $f(a_1) = f(a_2)$, then $a_1 = a_2$
					- This is the best version
	- Slide 15 - (7) Better definitions
		- Here F: $A \to B$ is a function
		- Theorem 2
			- The following are equivalent (TFAE)
				- f is [[onto]]
				- range(f) = codom(f)
		- Theorem 3
			- The following are equivalent (TFAE)
				- f is a [[bijection]]
				- For each b $\in$ B, there is exactly one a $\in$ A with f(a) = b
					- Very handy in countability section. Tells us exactly why bijection is the type of function we care about

	- Slide 16 - Reflection
		- What is the difference between the horizontal line test and the vertical line test
		- What is the difference between checking that something is a function, versus checking that it is an injection?
		- What do the following things look like on an arrow diagram: a surjection, not an injection, not a surjection
