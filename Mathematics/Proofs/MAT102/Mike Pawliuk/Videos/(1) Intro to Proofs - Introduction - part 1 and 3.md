	- Slide 4 - Learning Objectives (for this course)
		- By the end of this course, participants should be able to
			- Communicate mathematically
				- (1) Communicate mathematical ideas/arguments/proofs, using the language of mathematics, including terminology and notation, in an accurate, precise and coherent way
				- (2) Parse a mathematical sentence about fundamental notions and objects (such as sets, functions, divisibility, relations), as well as their properties
			- Think mathematically
				- (1) Identify and implement methods of proof (e.g., contradiction, induction) that can be used to prove a given mathematical statement
				- (2) Detect flaws and gaps in a mathematical argument, and identify ways to fix them
				- (3) Adapt ideas and techniques in given proofs to solve new problems
