	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives
		- By the end of this session, participants should be able to:
			- State the structure of [[strong induction]]
			- Explain the differences between strong and usual induction
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- Motivation
			- The final variation of induction we will look at is strong induction. This is a version that is used to prove theorems of the form "Every natural number has a \[nice\] representation"
			- It is also used when the induction step depends on many previous steps, and not only the one immediately before it.
	- Slide 4 - (1) Proof strategy for strong induction
		- Strong induction
			- If you want to prove a statement of the form "$\forall$ n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$, P(n)" you can show
				- P(1) is true
				- For all k $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$, P(1), P(2), ..., P(k) $\implies$ P(k+1)
		- Question: How is this different from (simple) induction?
		- Math answer: The IH is much stronger
		- CS answer: This requires a lot more memory since you need to remember all of your previous work
	- Slide 5 - Example
		- Theorem
			- Every natural number n $\ge$ 2 can be written as a product of primes

	- Slide 6 - (2) Example
		- Proof
			- By strong induction. Let P(n) be "n can be written as a product of primes"
		- [[base case]]
			- Base, n = 2. Notice 2 is a product of one [[prime]]
	- Slide 7 - Example
		- Proof
		- [[Induction step]]. Assume P(2), P(3), ..., P(n) are true for a particular n $\mathbb{N}$ 
			- Case 1: If n + 1 is prime, then it is the product of one prime
			- Case 2: If n+1 is not prime, then there are a,b $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$ with ab= n + 1 and 1 < a,b, < N+1
			- By P(a), a can be written as a product of primes. By p(b), b can be written as a product of primes
			- So n + 1 = ab can be written as a product of primes
	- Slide 8 - (3) Reversing this proof
		- Question
			- How does this proof tell us how to write 300 as a product of primes?
		- Note
			- To show P(300) we needed to use P(3) and P(100), not P(299)
				- In simple induction, would only need to remember one step before it
				- With strong induction, would need to remember P(3) and P(100)
	- Slide 9 - Binary representation
		- Theorem
			- Every natural number n $\ge$ 1 can be represented as a sum of distinct, non-negative integer powers of 2

	- Slide 10 - Reflection
		- What are the differences between simple induction and strong induction?
		- Were our proofs about the fibonacci numbers really "strong" induction? How much memory did they use?
		- Why do you think that the [[binary representation theorem]] is a good candidate to prove using strong induction?
