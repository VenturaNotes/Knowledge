	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives (for this video)
		- By the end of this video, participants should be able to
			- Explain the logic of a proof by contradiction
			- Produce a proof by contradiction
			- Decide which proof technique (direct, contrapositive, [[contradiction]]) is most appropriate
	- Slide 3 - Story about Avocados and Guacamole
		- Guacamole is a dip made from avocados
		- Starting thing was wrong
	- Slide 4 - [[Proof by contradiction]]
		- Proof technique (P $\implies$ Q) - Contradiction
			- To prove P $\implies$ Q, by contradiction: Assume P. Assume $\lnot$Q. Derive a contradiction. (Conclude Q)
			- Errata
				- We will look at three examples: one mild, one "medium", one spicy
	- Slide 5 - Example 1
		- An integer x is [[even]] if and only if $(\exists x \in \mathbb{Z})[x = 2k]$
		- An integer x is [[odd]] if and only if $(\exists m \in \mathbb{Z})[x = 2m +1]$ 
		- Theorem
			- If x is even, then x is not odd
				- $\rightarrow \leftarrow$ 
					- Indicates a [[contradiction]]

	- Slide 6 - Example 2
		- Exercise: Prove the following using a proof by contradiction
			- Theorem
				- There are no natural numbers x, y with $x^2 - y^2 = 1$
	- Slide 7 - Example 3
		- [[Lemma]]: If n $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$ and n > 1, then there is a [[prime number]] p such that p|n
		- Theorem ([[Proof due to Euclid]])
			- There are infinitely many prime numbers
		- "Suppose not" is another way to indicate to the reader the following proof is by [[contradiction]]
		- Proof
			- Suppose not. Let $p_1, p_2, ...,p_n$ be the list of all prime numbers. Let $N=p_1*p_2*p_3...*p_n + 1$. By the lemma, there is a $p_i$ so that $p_i|N$. However, this is impossible, since dividing N by $p_i$ will have a remainder of 1. $\implies\impliedby$
