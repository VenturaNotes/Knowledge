	- Slide 1 - Introduction to proofs - Triangle Inequality
	- Slide 2 - Learning Objectives (for this video)
		- By the end of this video, participants should be able to:
			- Apply the [[absolute value function]] in various contexts (algebraically and geometrically).
			- Relate/distinguish problem solving and rough work to a proof.
			- Break up a sum using the [[triangle inequality]].
				- In what's called a [[bounding argument]]
	- Slide 3 - Motivation
		- "The sum of any two sides of a triangle is always greater or equal to the third side." 
		- Motivation 
			- The triangle inequality is one of the two important inequalities we see in this course. We will understand it geometrically and algebraically.
	- Slide 4 - [[Absolute value]]
		- Definition (absolute value)
			- If x is a real number, then $h(x) = \begin{cases} x & \text {for } x \ge 0 \\ -x& \text{for } x < 0 \end{cases}$ 
			- Special case. |a - b| is the distance between and b
	- Slide 5 - More visualizations of absolute value
		- This picture shows us the inequality: for all real x, x $\le$ |x|.
		- What is the max value of |$x^2 - 1$| when |x| $\le$ 1?
			- At x = 0, |$x^2 - 1$| = 1
	- Slide 6 - Basic Facts about [[absolute value]]
		- Facts
			- Let x, y $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$
				- $x^2 = |x|^2$
				- $\sqrt{x^2} = |x|$
				- $x \le |x|$
				- $|xy| = |x||y|$
		- Special case of (4). If y = -1, get |-x| = |x||-1| = |x|.
			- A number in its negative will always have the same absolute value
		- Special case of this. |b -a| = | -(a - b)| = |a-b|
			- The distance from a to b is the same as the distance from b to a

	- Slide 7 - Motivation for [[Triangle Inequality]]
		- $$ \begin{align*} |x-y|&= |(x-z) + (z-y)| \\ &\le |x-z| + |z-y| \end{align*}  $$
		- Intuition. Direct routes are shorter than detours (to z)
	- Slide 8 - Triangle Inequality - Rough Work
		- Theorem (Triangle Inequality)
			- For all a, b $\in$ $\mathbb{R}$, |a + b| $\le$ |a| + |b|.
				- If you go from x to y, that's shorter than taking a detour.
				- Squaring both sides maintains the inequality
			- $xy \le |xy|$
				- This is the basic fact we will start from
	- Slide 9 - Proof of Triangle Inequality
		- Proof (shown in image)
	- Slide 10 - [[Bounding argument]]
		- Errata
			- For line 5 of proof, it should be $|x|^5$
		- Example
			- Find an M so that $|x^5 - 2x - 5|$ $\le$ M for all $|x| \le 2$
		- Proof
			- Solution Use the Triangle inequality (check image)
	- Slide 11 - Reflection
		- What's the value in understanding the absolute value function geometrically as well as algebraically
		- How is the triangle inequality related to triangles?
		- How come Desmos tells us that $|x^5 - 2x - 5| \le 33$ on the interval $-2 \le x \le 2$, but we got an answer of 41?
			- ![[Screenshot 2023-07-28 at 10.57.49 PM.png]]
				- It appears that 33 is the highest point that we can get on the interval between $-2 \le x \le 2$
				- Not really sure how to get the answer of 41 #archive
