## (1.1) Chessboard Problems
- “Math runs on definitions,” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=6&annotation=42GL7BTG))
	- ![[Pasted image 20230405114625.png]]
- “proposition (something which is true and requires proof)” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=6&annotation=WDMGIGHB))
	- ![[Pasted image 20230405114701.png]]
- “To say “there exists” something means that there is at least one example of it.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=6&annotation=RC36VI7L))
- “Proof . Observe that the following is a perfect cover.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=7&annotation=TL356CJZ))
	- ![[Pasted image 20230405114903.png]]
- “We typically put a small box at the end of a proof, indicating that we have completed our argument.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=7&annotation=6QG39WPP))
	- “This practice was brought into mathematics by <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Paul Halmos</mark>, and it is sometimes called the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Halmos tombstone</mark>.2” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=7&annotation=GTQ6YTE4))
- “Think about [[parity]] — meaning, evenness vs. oddness.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=8&annotation=XH73U9F9)) ^qry7ja
	- It is impossible to cover the board with dominoes if one square is crossed out due to parity
- “we begin with a “<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Proof Idea</mark>” section in which we discuss the central ideas in a more casual way.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=9&annotation=JAZWEJGW))
	- “While a “proof idea” may include the essence of why a proposition is true, a proof is more formal and thorough. Notions of formality and thoroughness are subjective, and it will take time to understand what level of rigor is required.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=9&annotation=JJKVS8D5))
- “integers are these numbers: . . . , −3, −2, −1, 0, 1, 2, 3, . . . ; that is, we include positive numbers, negative numbers and zero,” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=9&annotation=HV5F4I3Y))
- “We also used a picture within our proof. Pictures can help the reader, but you must also be careful that your picture is not too simplistic and misses special cases.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=11&annotation=GTHNMGYS))
	- “you want your proof to be 100% complete without the picture; the picture illustrates your words, but should not replace your words.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=11&annotation=JPDMZQJM))
- “In calculus, if two students submitted full-credit solutions, then it is likely their work looks very similar. For proofs, this is less likely.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=11&annotation=2DIHES2R))
	- “The central idea is the same as in our earlier proof, but their presentations are different. In other cases, two different proofs will rely on two different central ideas.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=12&annotation=SQR43WWV))
- “While good mathematicians can answer interesting questions, great mathematicians can ask interesting questions.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=12&annotation=3DL42CBF))
- “Indeed, pick up a math research paper and you will likely find more questions asked than answered. This provides wonderful job security for us academics.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=12&annotation=984WF9YN))

## (1.2) Naming Results
- Proved Results
	- [[Theorem]]
		- “A theorem is an important result that has been proved.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=13&annotation=KMUHPNPM))
			- “By “result” we mean a sentence or mathematical expression that is true.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=13&annotation=CD4ALPWU))
	- [[Proposition]]
		- “A proposition is a result that is less important than a theorem. It has also been proved.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=13&annotation=7CV3UEPA))
	- [[Lemma]]
		- “lemma is typically a small result that is proved before a proposition or a theorem, and is used to prove the following proposition or theorem.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=13&annotation=76HC2AVY))
	- [[Corollary]]
		- “corollary is a result that is proved after a proposition or a theorem, and which follows quickly from the proposition or theorem. It is often a special case of the proposition or theorem.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=13&annotation=IEFCXMZ5))
- [[Conjecture]]
	- “conjecture is a statement that someone guesses to be true, although they are not yet able to prove or disprove it.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=13&annotation=PSZHECQQ))
	- Example
		- ![[Pasted image 20230408103412.png]]
			- We could assume "that n randomly placed dots form $2^{n-1}$" even though this is not the case due to <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">counterexample</mark> which is that n=6 gives 31 regions.

## (1.3) The Pigeonhole Principle
- “the pigeonhole principle.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=15&annotation=28IC6ZJA))
	- Origin
		- “If 6 pigeons live in just 5 pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole must have at least two pigeons living in it.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=15&annotation=5Q2M6K7N))
	- “Said in complete generality: If at least kn + 1 pigeons live in n different pigeonholes, then at least one pigeonhole has at least k + 1 pigeons living in it.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=15&annotation=Q5T3YZT7))
		- Breakdown
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">n</mark> is the # of pigeonholes
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">kn + 1</mark> is the number of pigeons
			- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">k + 1</mark> tells us that at least 1 pigeonhole has at least k + 1 pigeons living in it
		- Example
			- Given 11 pigeons and 5 pigeonholes, find the least number of pigeons living in at least one pigeonhole
			- Equations
				- kn + 1 = 11
				- n = 5
			- Solving
				- 11 = k(5) + 1
				- k = 2
				- so k + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3
			- At least one pigeonhole has at least 3 pigeons living in it.
- ““at most 199,999 hairs” means “199,999 or fewer hairs.”” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=15&annotation=8YNGSE2X))
- “at least 5” means “5 or more.”
- If you are given boxes labeled 50,000 to 199,999 inclusively, there will be 150,000 boxes. Therefore, you should just find the absolute value of the difference of the two and add 1.
- “Principle 1.5 (The pigeonhole principle). The principle has a simple form and a general form. Assume k and n are positive integers.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=16&annotation=CH8C97HL))
	- “<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Simple form</mark>: If n + 1 objects are placed into n boxes, then at least one box has at least two objects in it.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=16&annotation=2QPDZIIQ))
		- The number of objects in this case is determined by the number of boxes. If you have 10 boxes, you'll have 11 objects. If you have 50 boxes, you'll have 51 objects. Therefore, at least one box will have at least two objects in it.
	- “<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">General form</mark>: If kn + 1 objects are placed into n boxes, then at least one box has at least k + 1 objects in it.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=16&annotation=QILTTKDU))
- Examples of the [[Pigeonhole principle]]
	- “There are 3 non-balding Sacramentans who have exactly the same number of hairs on their head.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=17&annotation=D6AVWZSG))
	- “Among any 5 playing cards, there are at least two cards of the same suit.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=17&annotation=8YCS7A35))
	- “Among any 37 people, 4 must have the same birthmonth.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/5LQBXNXV?page=17&annotation=3RFPFLMP))
