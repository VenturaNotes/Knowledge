- Consider the logical statements P,Q, and R
	- Which of the following are valid logical expressions?
	- a) $P \lor \lnot Q$  (YES)
	- b) $P \lor Q R$ (NO)
		- Can't put logical statements next to each other. There needs to be a logical connective
	- c) $P\lor Q \lor R$ (YES)
		- logical connectives between logical statements
	- d) $\lnot P \lor (Q \land R)$ (YES)
	- e) $\lnot P(Q \land R)$ (NO)
		- No logical connective between logical statements
	-  f) $\lnot \lnot p$ (YES)
		- You can see this as$\lnot (\lnot p)$
		- IT's ok to put these 2 connectives together
	- g) $\lnot \lnot \lnot \lnot \lnot Q$ 
		- You can negate logical expressions as many times as you want
