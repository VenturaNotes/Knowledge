- For each of the following sets, list the elements the set elements between braces {}

		- a) We are given the set consisting of all elements x in the natural numbers such that x is greater than -5 and x is less than or equal to 4
			- Natural Numbers - Integers that are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 and up
		- b) is the set 2x + 3 for all x in the set of integers
			- The Integers $\mathbb{Z}$ = {...-2,-1,0,1,2,...}

		- c) Consider set x where x is in all real numbers and $x^2$ is equal to 5
			- Real Number $\mathbb{R}$  = continuum of values from $-\infty$ to $\infty$
		- e) Construct the set 3x such that x is in a set of all real integers and the absolute value of 4x is less than or equal to 8
			- This is a compact description as a set written as an elementhood test. There are 2 elementhood tests
