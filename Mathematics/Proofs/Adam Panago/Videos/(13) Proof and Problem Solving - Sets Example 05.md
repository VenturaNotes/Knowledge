		- a) 
			- Will choose an arbitrary element from the set $x \in$ 
			- Definition of set difference operator - $A\backslash (A \cap B) = x \in A \land x \notin (A \cap B)$
				- When it shows you're in A and not in (A$\cap$B)
				- Gets rid of the slash
			- x $\notin$ (A $\cap$ B) = $\lnot (x \in A \cap B)$ (not changed anything. Just changed what the expression looks like)
			- Definition of set intersection - $(x \in A \cap B) = (x \in A \land x \in B)$
			- Contradiction - $(x \in A) \land \lnot (x \in A)$ because result will always be False
				- Contradiction Law - $(p \land \lnot p) \lor q = q$
