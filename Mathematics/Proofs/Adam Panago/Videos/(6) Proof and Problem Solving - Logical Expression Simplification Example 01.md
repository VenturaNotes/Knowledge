		- DeMorgan's Law: $\lnot (P \lor Q) = \lnot P \land \lnot Q$
		- Double negation law: $\lnot \lnot P = P$
		- Very easy to check your answer by constructing a truth table for the original expression and the simplified expression. The truth tables should match if the rules applied in the simplification is valid
