- Write a logical expression for the following English Sentences
	- Good Practice for working with logical connectives
		- Write logical expressions for English sentences
	- 1) Alice and Bob are both college students
		- (Must evaluate to a true or false statement)
		- Define 
			- A = Alice is a college student
			- B = Bob is a college student
				- [[Proposition|Logical statements]]: <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Declarative statement that is true or false</mark>
		- A $\land$ B
			- Reading this is synonymous with Alice is a college student <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">and</mark> Bob is a college student
	- 2) Neither Alice or Bob are college students
		- $\lnot$ A = Alice is not a college student
		- $\lnot$ Bob is not a college student
			- $\lnot$ A $\land$ $\lnot$ B
	- 3) Either Alice or Bob is a college student, but not both of them.
		- $(A\land\lnot B) \lor (\lnot A \land B))$
	- When you define symbols A and B, make sure you write them as logical statements and then write out logical expressions that mean the same thing as english sentences
