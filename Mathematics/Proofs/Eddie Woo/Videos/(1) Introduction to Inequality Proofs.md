	- Absolute value inequalities
	- Regions
	- am/gm proofs
		- [[Arithmetic mean]] and [[geometric mean]]
	- Real numbers can be ordered (this is because they exist on a number line. Not on a plane.)
		- Complex numbers (3 + 5i and 5+ 3i) cannot be ordered. 
			- It's like saying in a field of 2 dimensions, which "position" is the biggest position. There is no biggest position.
	- Inequalities have a direction
	- To write a proof for question 1, write the inequalities in the same direction and in order from smallest to largest ($b < a, a < d, d < c$) and you can say $\therefore$, smallest to largest is $b,a,d,c$
	- To find the next 2 inequalities, just add and subtract
