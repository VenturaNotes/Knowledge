- Mathematical Induction - Method of proof
	- It's just another tool in tool belt
	- "proof by induction"
	- same category as deduction
		- "Deductive geometry" - kind of logic that you use to start with something that you know and establish something else (prove something)
		- "Proof by contradiction" - can be seen in inequalities
			- Famous for showing why $\sqrt{2}$ numbers are irrational
	- Deals mainly with Discrete numbers (whole numbers)
		- Discrete math is a whole branch of math
	- Most questions we'll look at are integers and positive integers
	- There are a few applications in mathematical induction that vary
- eg.
	- Prove 1 +3 + 5 +... + (2n-1) = $n^2$  (this is a series of odd numbers)
		- (will prove by induction)
	- Calculators are good for concrete values
		- Not great for indeterminate things
		- Don't know how long the above series is. Could be any length.
	- Proving by Deduction
		- LHS (left hand side)
			- 1 + 3 + 5 + ... + (2n - 1) is an arithmetic series
