- Lesson Objectives:
	- Gain a basic understanding of [[fraction|fractions]]
	- Learn the difference between a [[proper fraction]], [[improper fraction]], and [[mixed number]]

	- Whole amount cut up into 4 equal parts
		- 1 pizza into 4 parts
	- 4 people
		- Each person will get $\frac{1}{4}$  of a pizza
			- The 1 is in the numerator
			- The fraction bar is below the 1
			- The 4 is in the denominator
- Fractions are generally used to describe how many equal pieces we have of a whole amount

	- 1 cookie
	- 4 equal parts
	- 3 parts have chocolate chips and 1 part has macadamia nuts
	- 3 parts of 4 has chocolate chips
		- 3/4 
			- 3 is in the [[numerator]]
			- 4 is in the [[denominator]]

	- Let's take a look at apple cut into 2 equal pieces
	- Each person gets 1 piece for a total of 2 equal pieces
		- 1/2
	- Each person gets one half of the apple

	- 8 people get an equal amount of the apple
		- So every person would get 1/8 of the apple

	- The above is a youtube video
	- Watched 1 part of 3 equal parts
	- Unwatched has 2 parts
		- 2/3 parts left
	- This is if the video is split up into 3 equal parts
- Identify the numerator and denominator in each:
	- 1/5
		- 1 is numerator
		- 5 is denominator
		- 1 part out of a total of 5 equal parts
	- 2/9
		- 2 is N
		- 9 is D
	- 1/4
		- 1 is N
		- 4 is D
	- 3/8
		- 3 is N
		- 8 is D
	- 5/7
		- 5 is N
		- 7 is D
	- 15/17
		- 15 is N
		- 17 is D
		- 15 parts out of a total of 17 equal parts
- Some important division rules to remember when working with fractions:
	- Any nonzero number that is divided by itself is going to result in 1
		- 4/4 = 1
		- If you consume 4/4 of a pizza, you consumed 1 whole pizza
	- Zero divided by any nonzero number is always 0
		- 0 / 3 = 0
- [[fraction|Fractions]] represent division of the numerator by the denominator. We can write a division problem using fractions:
	- 8 $\div$ 4 = 8/4 = 2
	- 20 $\div$ 5 = 20/5 = 4
	- 100 $\div$ 25 = 100/25 = 4
- A [[proper fraction]] is used to describe a quantity whose value is less than one
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-16 at 4.17.07 AM.png]]
		- These are all proper fractions
	- 15/7
		- Improper fraction since numerator is larger than denominator
	- -2/3
		- proper fraction (ignore the negative sign to determine this)
	- -11/9
		- improper fraction (ignore the negative sign to determine this)
- An improper fraction is used to describe a quantity equal to or larger than one
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-16 at 4.19.30 AM.png]]
		- All of the above are improper
- A mixed number is the sum of a whole number and a proper fraction
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-16 at 4.20.33 AM.png]]
- Determine whether each is a proper fraction, improper fraction, or mixed:
	- 7/5
		- Improper
	- 3/11
		- Proper
	- 4/5
		- Proper
	- 9 1/8 
		- Mixed number
	- 10/7
		- Improper
	- 6/7
		- proper
