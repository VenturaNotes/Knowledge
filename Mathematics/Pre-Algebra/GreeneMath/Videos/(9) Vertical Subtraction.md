- Lesson Objectives:
	- Learn how to subtract multi-digit numbers
	- Learn the [[borrowing]] procedure
- [[Vertical Subtraction]]
	- 1) Line up the subtraction problem vertically and by place value
		- 47 + 13 (commutative)

		- 47 - 13

				- What goes on top and what goes on bottom matters
				- 47 is the minuend which should be on top
				- 13 is the subtrahend which should be on the bottom
	- 2) Draw a horizontal line directly underneath the bottom number; place a "-" to the left of the bottom number

	- 3) Subtract in the ones column and place the result directly below the line

- 96 - 35

		- Minuend on top (96) and subtrahend (35) at bottom
- 87 - 23

- 27,375 - 10,164
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.47.11 AM.png|200]]
		- Minuend - Subtrahend
- In many cases, the lower digit of a column is larger than the upper digit. When this occurs, we use a procedure called "borrowing"
- 43 - 17

		- Cross 4 out and subtract 1. Then move 10 to the 3.
		- Changed the way it looked but didn't actually change the value of the number
- 512 - 395

		- Borrowing is temporarily changing what these columns look like so you can do subtraction. Writing in expanded notation can help
- 190,005 - 79,877
