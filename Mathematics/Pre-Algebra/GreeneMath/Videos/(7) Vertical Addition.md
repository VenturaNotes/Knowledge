- Lesson objectives:
	- Learn how to properly set up and perform [[vertical addition]]
	- Learn the process of [[carrying]]
- Vertical addition (used for multi-digit numbers. (numbers with more than 1 digit))
	- 1) Arrange the numbers to be added vertically and by place value
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.16.45 AM.png]]
			- Digit in ones place will line up and digits in tens place will line up
			- stack the numbers on top of each other
	- 2)  Draw a horizontal line underneath the bottom number and place a "+" to the left of the bottom number

	- 3) Add the numbers in each column starting with the ones column and moving left; place the result directly below the horizontal line

		- Always go right to left in vertical addition
- 27 + 12

		- Doesn't matter what order is the top or bottom number
	- Better way of thinking about it
		- 27 -> 2 tens (20) + 7 ones (7)
		- 12 -> 1 ten (10) + 2 ones (2)
		- 3 tens + 9 ones
		- 30 + 9 = 39
	- Must line up numbers by place value
- 405 + 314
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.23.15 AM.png|200]]
		- Work right to left
		- Start from the ones column, then tens columns, then hundreds column
- 2057 + 14,112
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.24.18 AM.png|300]]
		- It's easier to place number with more digits on top but it really doesn't matter in the end
		- The number with more digits will generally be on top
- 27 + 35
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.25.46 AM.png|300]]
		- This problem involves carrying
		- Right number of 12. The 2 will stay in the ones place and the 1 will be carried to the next column of the tens place. You'll do 1 + 2 + 3
	- What we really did
		-  ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.26.43 AM.png|400]]
- 242 + 977
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.28.05 AM.png|500]]
		- The one is just pushed out into the thousands column
- 6099 + 15,763
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.28.52 AM.png]]
		- Larger number usually put on top
