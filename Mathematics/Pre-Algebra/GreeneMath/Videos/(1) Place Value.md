- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Lesson Objectives</mark>:
	- Learn basic definitions of terms relating to place value
		- [[Place Value]]: The numerical value that a digit has by virtue of its position in a number [^1]
	- Gain a basic understanding of how our [[Number System|number system]] works
	- Learn how to construct and use a [[place value chart]]
- [[Whole Numbers]]
	- The whole numbers start with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">zero</mark> and increase in increments of one <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">indefinitely</mark>.
	- Whole Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
- [[Digit|Digits]]
	- The whole numbers 0 through 9 are referred to as digits:
		- 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9
		- The first 10 whole numbers
		- As we change a digit's position in a number, its value changes
	- Our number system relies on the digits, as well as place value to build each number.
	- Let's take a look at four numbers, each containing the digit 9:
		- 4<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">9</mark> = 40 + 9 (4 tens + 9 ones)
			- We're writing this in [[Expanded Notation|expanded notation]]
			- 9 is in the ones place (anything occupied by that place gets multiplied by 1)
		- 1<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">9</mark>2 = 100 + 90 + 2 (1 hundred + 9 tens + 2 ones)
			- 9 is in the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">tens</mark> place
			- Has a value of 90 because $9*10 = 90$ 
			- because it occupies a different place / position, its value changes
		- 3<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">9</mark>45 = 3000 + 900 + 40 + 5
			- 900 as value for 9 in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">hundreds</mark> place
			- 9 * 100 = 900
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">9</mark>687 = 9000 + 600 + 80 + 7
			- In the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">thousands</mark> place. 9* 1000 = 9000
		- As the 9 is in a different position in each number, it gets a different value. That's why we have a place value system.
		- As you move a digit around, it's going to obtain a different value
		- A digit gets its value by multiplying itself by the place value that it lies in.
- [[Place Value Chart]]
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 1.57.19 AM.png]] ^3bfd13
		- Multiply by 10 to find next place value
	- Easy way to learn and memorize your place values
	- Shows the place value for each digit in a number
		- Numbers continue forever so there's not going to be a largest place
	- Place value (ones place to trillions place)
		- ones
			- right most digit of a number is always in the ones place
			- right most position of a number
		- tens
			- one place left of ones
		- hundreds
		- thousands
		- ten thousands
		- hundred thousands
		- millions
		- ten millions
		- hundred millions
		- billions
		- ten billions
		- hundred billions
		- trillions
	- As you continue to move left places, the numbers become greater
	- This is all based on the number 10  
	- As you move to the left, you multiply by 10
	- To use the place value chart, take the right most digit and put it into the rightmost column (the ones)
	- Example
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.01.40 AM.png]]
			- Above is an expanded notation example 
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.04.30 AM.png]]
			- 0 in ten thousands is acting as a placeholder
				- allows us to put a space there without placing any value.
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Practice</mark>
	- Let's practice writing a number inside of a place value chart
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.06.08 AM.png]]
		- 673,452
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.06.58 AM.png]]
		- 7,853,922,673
	- A typical place value test, consists of questions that ask for the place value of a specified digit.
	- Let's try a few examples. Find the place value for each underlined digit:
		- 67<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">3</mark>,5<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">8</mark>1
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.08.59 AM.png]]
		- 6,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">3</mark>58,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">7</mark>91
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.10.43 AM.png]]
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">9</mark>,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">5</mark>51,0<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">7</mark>2,6<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">5</mark>6,010
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.12.53 AM.png]]
- Practice without chart
	- Let's try a few without the place value chart.
	- 70<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">3</mark>6
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.15.10 AM.png]]
		- Just multiply the ones by 10 to find the place value of the digit
		- The 3 is in the 10s place
	- 6<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">4</mark>,114
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.16.21 AM.png]]
		- 4 is in the thousands place
	- 1,<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">9</mark>98,004,557
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.17.27 AM.png]]
		- In the hundred millions place
