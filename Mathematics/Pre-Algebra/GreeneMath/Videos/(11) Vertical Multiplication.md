- Lesson Objective:
	- Learn how to multiply multi-digit numbers together
- When we multiply multi-digit numbers together, we use a process called [[vertical multiplication]]
	- We need to know our [[times tables]] to be successful at this
	- Must know at least up to 9x9
- Let's take a look at: 26 x 6 (commutative)
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.13.43 PM.png|300]]
	- Easier to put larger number on top
	- Same thing as: 6(20 + 6) = (6 x 20) + (6x6) = 120 + 36 = 156
		- 120 + 30 + 6 = 156
	- The multiplication process that we use is just a condensed version of the distributive property
- 613 x 5

		- If you move to the left when multiplying, you must add a 0.
		- We get partial products that we need to add
- 765 x 23

		- It's not a 2 times 5, it's a 20 x 5.
- 212,050 x 1075

		- As your numbers get larger, it doesn't get harder. it just becomes more tedious
		- You don't need to add the 0 placeholders there but you can to make the addition and multiplication easier.
