- Finding the GCD
- Lesson Objective
	- Learn how to find the [[greatest common divisor]] (GCD) for a group of numbers
- "What is the GCD of 12 and 30?" is asking the same thing as "What is the GCF of 12 and 30?"
	- GCF stands for greatest common factor

	- 4 and 3 are divisors as well
- When working with two or more numbers, the GCD is the largest whole number that is a divisor of all numbers ^7e3b13
- Finding the GCD ^048c69
	- Find the prime factorization of each number
	- Create a list of prime factors that are common to all numbers
	- the GCD is the product of the numbers on the list
- Find the GCD for each group of numbers:
