- Simplifying Fractions
	- Reducing a [[fraction]] to its smallest terms
- Lesson Objective
	- Learn how to simplify fractions
- x is for multiplication (such as 6 x 7 = 42)
	- However, in higher level math, you'll use a different symbol
	- A dot also means multiplication 
	- In algebra, you don't want the x to be confused with a variable
	- Visual

	- Shaded green is $\frac 12$ 
	- The 2 green parts in the bottom rectangle represents the same amount as the 1 shaded part in the top rectangle
	- It visually shows us how $\frac 12$ = $\frac 24$ 
- Equivalent fractions are fractions that have the same value.
- A fraction is considered simplified or reduced to its lowest terms when the numerator and denominator have no common factors other than 1.
- To reduce a fraction to its lowest terms
	- Factor the numerator and denominator
	- Cancel all common factors between the numerator and denominator
- Reduce each fraction to its lowest terms:

		- Used [[factor tree]] and [[long division]] for [[prime factorization]]

		- You will eventually be able to mentally do $\frac{-33}{77}$ = $\frac {-3}{7}$ without writing the prime factorization of a number

		- Having a negative in the numerator or outside the fraction is exactly the same thing
