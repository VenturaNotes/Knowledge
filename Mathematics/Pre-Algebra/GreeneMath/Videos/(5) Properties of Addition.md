- Lesson objectives:
	- Learn about the [[identity property of zero]]
	- Learn about the [[commutative property of addition]]
	- Learn about the [[associative property of addition]]
	- Lean to identify the parts of an addition problem
- [[Addition]] is the operation that allows us to group items together

		- 3 boxes + 2 boxes = 5 boxes
		- Gives total of all amounts that we've combined together
- In an addition problem, the numbers being added together are called [[Addend|addends]]. ^f5f129
- The result of an addition operation is known as the [[sum]].
- Identify each part of the addition problems below
	- 5 + 6 = 11
		- 5 and 6 are addends
		- 11 is the sum
	- 12 + 8 =  20
		- 12 and 8 are addends
		- 20 is the sum
- The identity property of zero tells us that adding zero to any number, leaves the number unchanged.
	- 5 + 0 = ? 
		- 5
	- 7 + 0 = ?
		- 7
	- 1,365,371 + 0 = ?
		- 1,365,371
- The commutative property of addition tells us we can add numbers in any order, without changing the sum.
	- 6 + 3 = 3 + 6
		- Order changed but will always get 9
		- 6 + 3 = 9
		- 3 + 6 = 9
		- Changing order of addends does not change the sum
	- 7 + 9 = 9 + 7
		- 7 + 9 = 16
		- 9 + 7 = 16
	- 12 + 5 = 5 + 12
		- 12 + 5 = 17
		- 5 + 12 = 17
- The associative property of addition tells us that the addition of three or more numbers can be grouped in any order without changing the sum.
	- (3 + 6) + 2 = 3 + (6 + 2)
		- Must do operations in parenthesis first
		- 3 + 6 = 9 + 2 = 11
		- 3 + 8 = 11
		- Gets the same result either way
	- 7 + (5 + 2) = (7 + 5) + 2
		- People say "the quantity" when something is inside a parenthesis
		- 7 + the quantity 5 + 2
		- 7 + 7 = 14 (left side)
		- 7 + 5 = 12 + 2 = 14 (right side)
		- Grouped differently but got 14 either way
	- (15 + 9) + 2 = 15 + (9 + 2)
		- the quantity 15 + 9 = 24 + 2 = 26 (left side)
		- 15  + the quantity (9+2) is 15 + 11 = 26 (right side)
		- We have the same 3 numbers being added (15, 9, and 2). We will get 26 no matter how we group the addition
