- Lesson Objective:
	- Learn how to find the mean, [[median]], and [[mode]] for a group of numbers

## Mean
- The [[mean]] (average) of a group of numbers is found by adding all of the numbers for the group, then dividing by the number of numbers in the group.

### Find the mean:

	- Can use long division to find 192 $\div$ 6

## Median
- To find the median for a group of numbers we arrange the numbers from smallest to largest. The median is:
	- 52,000, 58,000, 64,000, 60,000 are all relatively close together. Average should be representative of what these values are. If the 5th one was 18,000,000 (an outlier), the average would be pulled up and would not be representative of all the numbers. The median corrects for this
- Steps
	- The middle number when the number of numbers in the group is odd
	- The average of the two middle numbers if the number of numbers in the group is even

### Find the Median:

	- If in statistics class, an odd number of numbers, the median position is represented by $\frac {n+1} {2}$. "n" is just the numbers in the group. Replace the n by $\frac {7+1}{2}$ = 4 so the 4th position will be the median

	- The median is 4.5

## Mode
- The mode for a group of numbers is the number that occurs most often. We can have more than one mode.
	- If you had the group {3, 3, 3, 7, 7, 7}, the mode would be 3 and 7. If you had {3, 3, 4, 6, 8, 2}, the mode would be 3.

## Find the mode for each group of numbers
- 82, 86, 104, 82, 75, 30
	- Mode is 82
- 103, 27, -4, 2, 27, 3, 2, 27, 104
	- Mode is 27
- 333, 75, 81, 75, 621, 79, 333
	- There are two modes: 75, 333
