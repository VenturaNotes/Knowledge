## Lesson Objectives
- Learn how to write a [[ratio]] that describes a given situation
- Learn how to write a [[unit rate]] that describes a given situation

## Definition
- A ratio is a comparison of two quantities with the same units:
	- 4 boys for every 2 girls

## Examples

	- Take 2 numbers in simplified ratio and add them together
- A [[mixture]] contains 24ml of alcohol for every 8ml of water:
	- state the ratio of alcohol to water
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-04 at 2.18.19 PM.png]]
			- There are no units in a ratio since they cancel each other out
	- state the ratio of water to alcohol

	- How many ml of alcohol are in the mixture and how many ml of water are in the mixture?
		- With 120 ml of water, and the ratio of alcohol:water being $\frac 31$, then 4ml per group of 3ml alcohol and 1ml of water. 120ml/4ml = 30 so $30*3=90ml \text { alcohol}$ and $30*1 = 30ml \text { water}$ 

## Rates
- Similar to ratios, a [[rate]] is a special type of ratio that compares two quantities with different units:
	- Generally, we divide the numerator by the denominator to get a unit rate, or the rate per single unit.

### Examples
- Jeff earned $63 in 9 hours. What is the unit rate in dollars per hour?
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-01-04 at 2.24.24 PM.png]]
		- He earned 7 dollars/hour
- Jennifer drove 125 miles in 5 hours. What was the unit rate in miles per hour?

- Unit rates are often used to compare prices. 5 gallons of milk sells for $15, while 10 gallons of milk sells for $20. Which option has a lower cost per gallon?
