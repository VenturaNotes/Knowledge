- [[Exponent|Exponents]] with an integer base
- Lesson Objective
	- Learn how to perform operations with exponents that have an integer base
- Exponents are used to conveniently notate repeated multiplication of the same number
	- 3x3x3x3x3 = $3^5$ 
		- We have 5 factors of 3
		- 3 is the base here
		- 5 is the exponent
	- 7x7x7 = $7^3$ 
		- 7 is the base
		- 3 is the exponent
- When working with a [[negative number]] that is raised to a power, the base does not include the negative part unless we use parentheses!
	- The below calculations is wrong in general
		- $-2^2$ = -2 x (-2) = 4
			- You calculate this
		- $-2^2 = -4$
			- The calculator returns this
	- $-2^2$ = -1 x $2^2$ = -1 x 4 = -4
		- This is read as the opposite of $2^2$ 
		- Need to do exponents first
	- $(-2)^2$= -2 x (-2) = 4
		- They need to be enclosed so they're both part of the base
	- $(-1 x 2)^2$ 
		- = (-1 x 2) x (-1 x 2)
			- = -1 x 2 x - 1x2
				- = -1 x -1 x 2 x 2 = 4
	- If you have a negative number and you want to raise it to a power, you need to enclose negative number inside the set of parenthesis
	- $-4^3$ = -1 x $4^3$ =-1 x 64 = -64
		- read as "the opposite of 4 cubed" or "the negative of 4 cubed"
	- $(-4)^3$
		- -4 x (-4) x (-4)
			- = -64
				- Same answer as above because it just happened to work out that way.
- When the base is (-) and enclosed in parentheses:
	- The result is (+) if the exponent is [[even]]
	- The result is (-) if the exponent is [[odd]]
- When the base is (-) and not enclosed in parentheses:
	- the result is always (-)
		- -$4^2$ = -16
		- $(-4)^2$ = 16
			- Exponent is even so product is positive
- Evaluate each:
	- $(-3)^2$ = (-3) x (-3) = 9
		- even number of negative factors gives a positive result
	- $(-3)^5$ = -243
	- $(-1)^{38}$ = 1
		- Exponent is even for negative factors which gives positive
	- $(-1)^{71}$ = -1
	- $(-10)^3$ = -1000
		- $10^3$ = 1000
	- $-8^2$  = -1 x $8^2$ = -1 x 64 = -64
	- $(-8)^2$ = +64
	- $(-5)^3$ = -125
		- Negative because exponent is odd
		- -5 x (-5) x (-5) shows you have 3 negative factors so you'll get a negative result
	- $-5^3$ = -125
		- Negative because when the base is negative but not enclosed in parentheses, the result will always be negative
