- Lesson Objective:
	- Learn how to divide multi-digit numbers using [[long division]]
- When we have large numbers with addition, we used a process called vertical addition. Vertical addition breaks it down into a series of easier steps.
	- 24, 322 + 308 (made columns to find answer)
- When subtracting [[whole numbers]], used [[vertical subtraction]]
- When multiplying large whole numbers, used [[vertical multiplication]]
- Long division is division with large whole numbers
- To find 20 $\div$ 4 = ?
	- ? x 4 = 20
	- ? = 5
- 2,642,311 $\div$ 1622 (need long division for this)
- 30 $\div$ 6 = ?
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 5.32.44 PM.png|300]]
		- 30 goes underneath the house
		- The dividend is 30
		- 6 is divisor which goes to left of symbol
	- Steps
		- Divide (Dad)
		- Multiply (Mom)
		- Subtract (Sister)
		- Bring down (Brother)
		- Repeat or remainder (Rover)
	- Visuals
		- Divide

				- How many times will 6 go into 3?
				- What is 3 divided by 6?
				- 6 goes into 3 zero times because 
					- Given 3 items 3 $\div$ 6 = 0 R 3
					- Made 0 groups with 3 left over
					- Never include remainder until the end of long division problem
		- Multiply

				- 0 x 6 = 0
		- Subtract

		- Bring Down
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 5.38.03 PM.png]]
		- Now Repeat (Divide)
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 5.39.09 PM.png]]
			- How many times does 6 go into 30? (5)
				- ? x 6 = 30 
				- 5 x 6 = 30 (so answer is 5)
		- Multiply

		- Subtract
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 5.58.23 PM.png|200]]
		- Bring down (nothing to bring down)
		- Remainder (It's 0 so no remainder)
	- Shortcut

		- Since 6 does not go into 3, check the place value to the right and see if 6 can go into 30.
- 100 $\div$ 5
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 6.10.19 PM.png|200]]
- 315 $\div$ 9 = 35
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 6.12.27 PM.png|300]]
		- 3x9 = 27
			- Highest you can go without going over (36)
		- Easy to check too 
- 942 $\div$ 3 = 314
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 6.14.59 PM.png|300]]
- Now with remainders
	- 461 $\div$ 2
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 6.24.04 PM.png|300]]
	- 193 $\div$ 9 = 21 R4
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 6.26.54 PM.png|300]]
	- 126,323 $\div$ 15
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 6.32.47 PM.png|300]]
			- Do this to find how many times 15 goes into 126 (126$\div$ 15) which requires some guess work
				- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 6.28.11 PM.png]]
			- Not checking this one because of the amount of work that would be involved
				- Multiply 8,421 x 15 + 8 to check that it equals 126,323
	- 163,971 $\div$ 150
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 6.38.11 PM.png|300]]
			- Finding how many times 150 goes into 1397
				- 1379 $\div$ 150 = ?
				- 150 x 10 = 1500
				- 150 x 9 = 1350 =good guess)
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 6.36.26 PM.png]]
				- Going to to test 3 times to check how many times 150 goes into 471
