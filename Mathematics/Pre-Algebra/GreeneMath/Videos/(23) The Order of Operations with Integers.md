- Lesson Objective:
	- Learn how to use the order of operations when integers are involved
- The [[Order of Operations]]:
	- 1) Work inside of [[grouping]] symbols
	- 2) Perform all exponent operations
	- 3) Multiply or Divide (left to right)
		- Occur on the same level
	- 4) Add or Subtract (left to right)
		- Occur on the same level
	- Can think of [[PEMDAS]] for this
- Evaluate each (find the value for)
	- $7 + (-2)^2 + (-9) + 1^2$ 
		- Use exponent operations
			- = 7 + 4 (-9) + 1
		- Reorder addition (commutative property)
			- 7 + 4 + 1 + (-9) 
		- Do the addition
			- = 12 + (-9)
		- Do subtraction
			- = 3
