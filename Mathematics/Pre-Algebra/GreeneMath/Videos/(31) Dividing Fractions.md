- Dividing Fractions
- Lesson Objectives:
	- Learn how to find the [[reciprocal]] of a number
	- Learn how to divide [[fraction|fractions]]
- To find the reciprocal of a number, we interchange the numerator and denominator:
	- A number times its reciprocal will always result in 1

- To find the reciprocal of a whole number or integer:
	- write the number over 1 and interchange the numerator and denominator

		- The top shows how to find the reciprocal and the bottom shows that it's true since a number times its reciprocal will always equal 1

		- The $-\frac 75$ could be written as $\frac {7}{-5}$ or $\frac{-7}{5}$. They both mean the same thing.

	- Reciprocal of $7$ is $\frac 17$ 
	- Reciprocal of -4 is $-\frac 14$ 
	- Reciprocal of $\frac {13}{5}$ = $\frac {5}{13}$
- To divide fractions, we multiply the first fraction (left) by the reciprocal of the second fraction (right).
