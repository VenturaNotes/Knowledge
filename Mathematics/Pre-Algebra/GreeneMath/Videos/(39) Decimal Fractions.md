		- Parts of decimal
			- Decimal point (connects 2 groups of numbers)
			- Whole amount (left of decimal point)
			- Part of a whole (to right of decimal point)
		- Denominator is whole amount split up into equal parts
## Change to a Decimal:
- Count the number of zeros in the denominator, then delete the denominator
	- 56/100 has 2 zeros
- in the numerator, move the decimal point to the left by the number of zeros we counted in the denominator
	- 56.00000
		- You can have as many 0s as you want 
	- 0.56
		- Putting 0 in front is more used for clarity
