- Lesson Objectives:
	- Learn how to divide a [[decimal]] by a whole number
	- Learn how to divide a decimal or whole number by a decimal
- To divide a decimal by a whole number:
	- Set up the [[long division]] normally
	- Place the decimal point in the answer directly above the decimal point in the dividend

		- [[Dividend]], [[Divisor]], [[Quotient]]
	- Divide normally

	- Can check by doing $-.31 \times 7 = -2.17$

- Recall that after a decimal point a zero does not add value unless it precedes a non zero number!

- Occasionally, we get a digit or series of digits that repeat forever. When this occurs, we place a "-" over the part that repeats.
	- $4.3333... = 4.\overline 3$ 
	- $3.457457457... = 3. \overline {457}$

- $96.12 \div 10 = 9.612$ 
- 96.12 $\div$ 100 = 0.9612
- 96.12 $\div$ 10,000 = 0.009612
- Our other scenario involves dividing by a decimal:
	- Move the decimal point in the divisor by enough places right to make it into a whole number
	- We then match that movement with the decimal point in the dividend
