- Lesson Objective:
	- Learn how to change a [[mixed number]] into an [[improper fraction]] and vice versa
- Improper Fraction to Mixed Number
	- divide the numerator by the denominator

	- the [[quotient]] is the whole number for the mixed number
		- The 3 is this case will be the whole number for the mixed number (since it's our quotient when we did long division above)
	- the [[remainder]] is the numerator for the fraction part
		- $3 \frac 13$ 
			- The 1 was the remainder and the denominator will be the original denominator from the improper fraction

- Mixed Number to Improper Fraction
	- multiply the denominator of the fraction part by the whole number part
		- $3 \frac 38$ = 3 x 8
	- add the result to the numerator of the fraction part
		- 3x8+1 = 25
			- You can do (3x8) to be crystal clear for what you want to do
	- The result is the numerator for the improper fraction
