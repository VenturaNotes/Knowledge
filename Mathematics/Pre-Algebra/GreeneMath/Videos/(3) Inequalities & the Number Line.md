- Lesson objectives
	- Learn how to create and work with a [[Number Line|number line]] for the [[whole numbers]]
	- Learn about [[inequality|inequalities]]
- Whole Numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
	- We can use a number line to visually represent the whole numbers:
	- The 3 dots tells us that the pattern continues forever
	- We can use a number line to visually represent the whole numbers:

		- Leftmost spot is 0
		- Arrow tells us that the number line continues forever and ever.
- When we look at a number line, we can see that:
	- numbers increase from left to 
		8 is a larger number than 4 because it lies on the right side of the number line
	- numbers decrease from right to left
		- If a number lies to the left on the number line, it is smaller than the number to its right.
		- 0 is a smaller number than 1 because it lies to the left of 1 on the number line
- The equal sign (=) tells us that two quantities are equal
	- 6 = 6
	- 10 + 6 = 16 (we know this is true when simplified)
		- 16 = 16
- To say 2 quantities are not equal, write $5\ne4$ 
	- $3\ne7$ 
	- 6 + 2 $\ne$ 9
- < less than symbol (we use this when the quantity on the left is smaller or less than the quantity on the right)
	- $2 \lt 6$ 
	- $4 \lt 10$ 
- If there is a quantity on the left greater than the quantity on the right, we use a > (greater than symbol)
	- 11 > 2
	- 9 > 6
- The symbol points to the smaller number
- With 3 ? 2
	- 3 > 2 (because the symbol points to the smaller number)
	- 1 < 6
- Practice (Replace each ? with the [[inequality]] symbol < or >)
	- 1 ? 3

			- 1 is on the left side of 3 on the number line
	- 5 ? 0
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 2.47.15 AM.png]]
			- 0 is less than 5 because it is on the left side of 5 on the number line
	- 9 ? 7

	- 2?3

	- 8 ? 6

			- Point the symbol towards the smaller number
