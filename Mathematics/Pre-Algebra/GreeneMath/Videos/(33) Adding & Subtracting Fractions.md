- Lesson Objectives
	- Learn how to add/subtract fractions with a [[common denominator]]
	- Learn how to find the LCD of two or more fractions
		- [[Least common denominator]] or lowest common denominator
	- Learn how to add/subtract fractions without a common denominator
- When we add or subtract fractions, we must have a common denominator

## Examples with common denominator

	- Could just find the prime factorization as well and cross them out to simplify fraction.

## Adding/Subtracting Fractions without a common denominator
- Find the LCD (this is the [[least common multiple|LCM]] of the denominators)
	- Finding the lowest common denominator
- Write equivalent fractions with the LCD as each denominator
- Add/subtract the numerators
- Simplify 

## Examples without a common denominator

		- You could also just multiply the denominators together of the fractions and make multiply each fraction so that they all have that denominator. It works if you can't find the least common denominator, but it means you have to do more calculations to get your solution.

	- Shortcut: if each denominator is a prime number, you just multiply the denominators together to get your least common denominator since they don't share any factors as they are prime numbers.
	- Also note, if the negative symbol was on the 5 in the denominator, just move it up to the numerator
