- Lesson Objectives
	- Discover a new set of numbers known as the [[integers]]
	- Use the number line to determine the relationship between integers
	- Learn how to find the [[opposite]] of a number
	- Learn to simplify with multiple "-" symbols
- [[Whole Numbers]]: 0, 1, 2, 3,...

		- This is a visual representation of whole numbers on the number line
			- leftmost notch is a 0.
			- Arrow says number continues forever
			- Each notch increments by 1
- Every number that is larger than zero is known as a positive number
	- We can place a "+" in front of a number to indicate that it is positive
		- You can do +3 to indicate that the 3 is a positive number
		- The 
- When we encounter a number that is less than zero, we refer to it as a negative number
	- Negative numbers always have a "-" sign in front
		- -3 shows negative 3
			- Examples are temperature or bank account value or in football (loss in a play)
- [[Zero]] is a special number:
	- It is not positive or negative
- The [[Integers]] include the whole numbers and their negative counter parts:
	- Integers: ..., -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...
	- Whole numbers and numbers to left of zero

		- Let's take a look at the integers on a number line:
			- 0 is neither negative or positive. It's neither
- To understand the relationship between integers, we need to do some extra thinking:
	- -4 > 1? (incorrect)
		- Bigger negatives are actually getting smaller
		- 2 is smaller than 6 because it's to the left on the number line
		- -4 < 1
		- If confused, just see how 50 > 10. If they're negative numbers, just flip the sign. -50 < -10. -50 is a bigger negative number
- Replace each ? with the [[inequality symbol]] < or >
	- The inequality symbol must point to the smaller number
	- Can just imagine in terms of money
	- -2 ? 5
		- -2 < 5
	- 1 ? -1
		- 1 > -1
	- -7 ? -4
		- -7 < -4
- [[Opposites]] are numbers that have the same distance from zero on the number line, but lie on opposite sides of the number line
	- 1, -1
	- 2, -2
	- 3, -3
- To find the opposite of a number, we just change the sign
	- Find the opposite of each:
		- The opposite and [[additive inverse]] mean the same thing
		- 5 -> -5
		- 12 -> -12
		- 315 -> -315
		- -1,718,311 -> 1,718,311
- Simplify each
	- -(-4) = 4
		- When you have a "-" directly next to a number, it's making the number negative
		- The negative outside the parenthesis tells you to change the sign
		- Can be read "the opposite of -4"
	- -(-3) = 3
	- -(-(-15)) = -(15) = -15
		- An even number is divisible by 2. When you divide by 2, there is no remainder.
		- An odd number is not divisible by 2.
		- "the opposite of" "the opposite of" -15
		- Each time you have a pair of negatives makes a positive
		- Even number of negatives gives positive number
			- -(-(-(-15))) = 15
		- Odd number of negatives gives negative number
	- -(-(-(-(-(-24))))) = 24
		- Just count the number of symbols
		- 6 negative symbols makes it even making the product equal positive
	- -(-(-(-(-(-(-(-(-9)))))))) = -9
		- 9 negative signs which is odd making the product negative
