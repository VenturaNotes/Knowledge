- Lesson Objectives
	- Learn how to convert a [[decimal]] to a percent and vice versa
	- Learn how to convert a [[fraction]] to a percent
- A [[percent]] is another method used to describe a part of a whole amount.
- A percent is a fraction whose denominator is 100
	- We use the "%" to denote a percent
	- the meaning is "parts per 100"
## Examples
- $\frac {17} {100} = 17\%$
- $\frac {96} {100} = 96\%$
- $\frac {512} {100} = 512\%$
- $\frac {.01}{100} = .01\%$ 

## Decimal to Percent:
- To write a decimal as a percent, we move our decimal point two places to the right and place the "%" at the end

## Examples - Change each decimal to a percent:

- $0.115 = 11.5\%$
- 6.23 = 623%
- 0.85 = 85%
- 0.00037 = .037%
- 0.014 = 1.4%
- 312.25 = 31,225%

## Percent to Decimal:
- To write a percent as a decimal, we move our decimal point two places to the left and delete the "%".

## Examples - Change each percent to a decimal:
- 4.27% = 0.0427
- 39.867% = .39867
- 215.37% = 2.1537
- 0.003591% = 0.00003591

## Tedious Scenario
- A more tedious situation comes up when we are asked to convert a fraction to a percent.
