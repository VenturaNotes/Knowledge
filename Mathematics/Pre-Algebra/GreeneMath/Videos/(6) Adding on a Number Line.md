- Adding [[Whole Numbers]] using a Number Line
- Lesson Objective:
	- Learn how to add whole numbers using a [[number line]]
- During a previous lesson, we talked about using a number line to visually represent a group of numbers.
- Let's look at a number line that shows the whole numbers: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...
	- The 3 dots means that the pattern which were increasing in increments of 1 is going to continue forever. (5,6,7 so on and so forth)
- Visual representation of the whole numbers on number line

	- Every time you have another notch, you move on to the next whole number
		- These lines can also be referred to as ticks
	- Impossible to list all the whole numbers
	- 0 is the leftmost number
	- The arrow says it'll continue forever
- We can use the number line to visually show the addition of whole numbers. This may seem like a trivial exercise, but it will help us a lot when we start working with integers.
- So how do we add whole numbers on a number line?
- We start at the left most number, and move to the right by the number of units being added.
	- 3 + 7
		- Start at 3 on the number line
		- Move to the right by 7 units
- Add 2 + 6 using the number line

- Add 4 + 7 using a number line

		- larger and more crowded number line
		- 4 + 7 = 11
- Add 6 + 5 + 1 using a number line

		- 6 + 5 + 1 = 12
- Add 3 + 2 + 1 + 7 using a number line
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.13.18 AM.png]]
		- 3 + 2 + 1 + 7 = 13
- Add 2 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 7 + 1 using a number line
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.14.53 AM.png]]
		- 2 + 3 + 5 + 4 + 7 + 1 = 22
