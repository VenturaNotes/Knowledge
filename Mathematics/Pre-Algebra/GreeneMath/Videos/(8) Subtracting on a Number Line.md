- Subtracting whole numbers using a number line
- Lesson Objectives
	- Learn how to identify the parts of a subtraction problem
	- Learn how to subtract whole numbers using a number line
- [[Subtraction]] is the mathematical operation that allows us to take away. The main idea behind subtraction is to find out how much is left over.
- Let's say you have 3 $1 bills
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.31.06 AM.png]]
	- If you spent $2, you will have $1 left over
- Again, subtraction is the operation that allows us to take away. In the example, two was taken way from a starting amount of three. The result was one.
- To be more formal, let's give names to the parts of a subtraction problem:
	- [[Minuend]] - whole amount or starting value
		- In 3 - 2 = 1, the minuend is 3
	- [[Subtrahend]] - amount being taken or subtracted away
		- In 3 - 2 = 1, the subtrahend is 2
	- [[Difference]] - the result of the subtraction operation
		- In 3 - 2 = 1, the 1 is the difference
- Name the parts of the following subtraction problems
	- 13 - 7 = 6
		- 13 is minuend (starting with)
		- 7 is subtrahend (took away)
		- 6 is the difference (amount left over)
	- 8 - 3 = 5
		- 8 is minuend
		- 7 is subtrahend
		- 5 is difference
- It's very important to note that the [[commutative property]] that is associated with addition <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">does not work with subtraction</mark>
	- 3 + 9 = 9 + 3 (works)
	- 3 + 6 = 6 + 3 (works)
	- 6 - 3 $\ne$ 3 - 6
		- 6 - 3 = 3
		- 3 - 6 = -3
		- Changing the order does not give the same result.
	- 9 - 2 $\ne$ 2 - 9
		- 9 - 2 = 7
		- 2 - 9 = -7
	- 7 - 5 $\ne$ 5 - 7
		- 7 - 5 = 2
		- 5 - 7 = -2
	- As a general rule when you're adding, you can change the order as much as you want. As a general rule in subtracting, you can't do that
- Let's talk about subtracting whole numbers on the number line. This exercise will help us greatly when we start working with integers.
- Subtract each using a number line (7-4):
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.37.35 AM.png]]
		- Start with leftmost number
		- Go to the left by 4
- 12 - 5
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.37.58 AM.png]]
- 8 - 7
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.38.23 AM.png]]
		- Move 7 units to the left
- 5 - 5
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-12 at 3.40.42 AM.png]]
		- If you add on a number line, you start with the leftmost number and go to the right based on the number of units you're adding
		- If you're subtracting on a number line, start at the leftmost number and move to the left by the number of units you're subtracting away
