- Lesson Objective
	- Learn how to convert between metric units
- Commonly used metric units:
	- [[Gram]] -> [[weight]]
	- [[Liter]] -> [[volume]]
		- Sodas are usually measured in liters
	- [[Meter]] -> [[length]]
- When we have values that are larger or smaller than the basic unit, we use a [[prefix]]:
	- [[kilo]] -> 1000
		- 1000 meters = 1 kilometer
	- [[hecto]] -> 100
		- 100 meters = 1 hectometer
	- [[deka]] -> 10
	- [[deci]] -> .1
		- one tenth $(\frac {1}{10})$
	- [[centi]] -> .01
		- one hundredth $(\frac {1}{100})$
	- [[milli]] -> .001
		- one thousandths $(\frac {1} {1000})$
		-  $(\frac {1} {1000})$ Liter = 1 milliliter
