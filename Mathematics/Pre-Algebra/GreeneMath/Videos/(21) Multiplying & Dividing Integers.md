- Lesson Objectives:
	- Learn how to multiply integers
	- Learn how to divide integers
- We all know that the [[product]] of two positive numbers is positive
	- (+) x (+)  = +
		- 6 x 7 = 42
- What happens when we introduce negative values?
	- Explanation
		- Different signs gives negative result
		- Same signs gives a positive result
	- (+) x (-) = -
		- 7 x (-2) = -14
	- (-) x (+) = -
		- (-2) x 7 = -14
	- (-) x (-) = +
	- (+) x (+) = +
- Multiplying integers
	- Determine the sign of the product
	- Multiply absolute value
		- abs(0) is 0
		- abs(anything else) = positive
- -3 x 6 = -18
	- opposite signs so negative
- 3 x -4 = -12
	- Different signs
- -12 x 5 = -60
	- Different signs
- -13 x (-8) = 104
	- Same signs
- -10 x (-7) = 70
	- same signs
- -11 x (-4) = 44
	- same signs
- What happens if we multiply more than two integers?
	- -5 x 1 x (-7) x (-3) 
		- = -5 x (-7) x (-3)
			- = +35 x (-3)
				- = -105
		- Below is only true if we don't include the negatives between absolute value bars
			- [[Even number]] of negative numbers gives positive result
			- [[Odd number]] of negative numbers gives negative result
- -2 x (-4) x 12 = +96
	- Counted 2 negatives so result is positive
- Dividing Integers
	- Determine the sign of the quotient
	- Divide absolute values
	- (+) $\div$ (+) = +
	- (+) $\div$ (-) = -
	- (-) $\div$ (+) = -
	- (-) $\div$ (-) = +
	- Same sign rules as multiplication
		- [[Same signs]] gives positive
		- [[Different signs]] gives negative
- Examples
	- -40 $\div$ 8 = -5
		- different signs
	- -20 $\div$ 5 = 4 
		- different signs
	- -100 $\div$ (-10) = 10
		- Same signs
	- -35 $\div$ (-7) = 5
		- same signs
	- 22 $\div$ (-2) = -11
		- different signs
	- 16 $\div$ (-4) = -4
		- different signs
