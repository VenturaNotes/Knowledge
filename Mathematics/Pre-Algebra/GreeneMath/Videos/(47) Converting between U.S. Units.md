- Lesson Objective:
	- Learn how to change between [[U.S. units of measurement]]
- Let's start by looking at the relationship between a few common units of measurement:
- [[Length]]:
	- 12 inches = 1 foot
	- 3 feet = 1 yard
	- 5280 feet = 1 mile
- [[Weight]]:
	- 16 ounces = 1 pound
	- 2000 pounds = 1 ton
- [[Volume]]:
	- 2 cups = 1 pint
	- 2 pints = 1 quart
	- 4 quarts = 1 gallon
- [[Time]]
	- 60 seconds = 1 minute
	- 60 minutes = 1 hour
	- 24 hours = 1 day
	- 7 days = 1 week
- If we are asked to convert 5280 feet into miles, it's pretty simple. What happens if we want to convert 6600 feet into miles?

- Our first step is to set up a unit fraction. A unit fraction shows the relationship between units and has a value of 1.
	- $4 * \frac 33 = \frac {12}{3}$ 
	- $\frac {5280 \text { feet}}{1 \text { mile}}$= 1
- To perform the conversion:
	- identify the relationship between the units
		- 5280 feet = 1 mile
	- write the [[unit fraction]] with the unit of measure you want to end up with in the numerator
		- 6600 feet = ? miles
		- $\frac {1 \text { mile}} {5280 \text { feet}}$= 1
			- this is the unit fraction
	- multiply what you are trying to convert by the unit fraction

## Multiple Conversions
- You can also carry out multiple conversions in one shot. Let's suppose that you don't know the relationship between cups and gallons.
