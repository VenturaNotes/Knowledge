- Finding the LCM
- Lesson Objective:
	- Learn how to find the [[least common multiple]] for a group of numbers
- To obtain the [[multiple|multiples]] of a number, we multiply the number by each nonzero whole number:

		- Multiples of 11
- Common multiples are multiples that are common to all numbers of a group: 
	- Find the multiples of 4 and 5

- Finding the LCM from each number's prime factorization:
	- 1) Factor each number completely
	- 2) List the prime factors of each number in a table
	- 3) Generate a list that contains each prime factor
	- 4) When a prime factor is repeated between two or more numbers, include only the largest number of repeats from any of the prime factorizations
	- 5) the LCM is the product of the numbers on the list
- Find the LCM for each group of numbers
	- LCM(9,12)
