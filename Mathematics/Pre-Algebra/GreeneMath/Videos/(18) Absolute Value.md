- Lesson Objectives
	- Learn how to find the absolute value of a number
	- Learn how to simplify when absolute value is present
- The absolute value of a number is the distance between that number and zero on the number line.
	- |3| -> What is the absolute value of 3?
		- Can count that 3 is 3 units away from 0
	- |-3| = 3
	- Opposites will always have the same [[absolute value]] because they have the same distance from zero on the number line

		- |7| = 7
		- |-7| = 7
	- Absolute value of a number will always be 0 or a positive number
- If the number is negative, make it positive
	- |-37| = 37
- If the number is zero or positive, keep it the same
	- |42| = 42
- Examples
	- |19| = 19
	- |0| = 0
	- |-24| = 24
	- |-34,422| = |34,422
- Replace the ? with the correct symbol <, >, or =
	- |-27| ? |22|
		- |-27| > |22|
	- |0| ? |-5|
		- |0| < |-5|
	- |-7| ? 7
		- |-7| = |7|
	- -|-13| = -(13) = -13
		- -(-13) = 13
		- You can only count the number of negative symbols you have outside the absolute value bars
			- Anything in the bars will always make number positive (or if its 0 -> 0)
	- -(-|21|) = -(-(21)) = -(-21) = 21
		- Odd means negative for # of negative signs
		- Even means positive for # of negative signs
	- -(-(-|-53|)) = -(-(-(53))) = -(-(-53)) = -(53) = -53
	- -(-(-|6+3|)) = -(-(-|9|)) = -(-(-(9))) = -(-(-9)) = -(9) = -9
- If you're taking the absolute value of a negative number make it positive
- If you're taking the absolute value of a positive number or 0, keep it the same when evaluating
