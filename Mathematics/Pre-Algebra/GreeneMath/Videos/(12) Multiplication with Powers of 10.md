- [[Multiplication]] with [[trailing zeros]]
- Lesson objective
	- Learn how to multiply numbers with trailing zeros.
- 600
	- Has 2 trailing zeros
- 17,000
	- Has 3 trailing zeros
- 104,030
	- Has 1 trailing zero because the 0 in the hundreds place is interrupted by the 3 in the tens place
- 5 x 10 = 50
	- 5 x 1 = 5 (then attach 0 to the end to get 50. Just add the number of trailing zeros to the product here).
- 5 x 100 = 500
	- To solve this, do 5x1 which is 5. Then because the 100 has 2 trailing zeros, add these trailing zeros to the product which would give you the correct answer of 500.
- 5 x 10,000 = 50,000
- Steps
	- Leave off any trailing zeros and multiply the numbers that result
	- Attach the total number of trailing zeros (between all factors) to the right of your product.
- 3 x 60 = 180

- 17 x 1000 = 17000

- 70 x 300 = 21,000

- 153x9000

- 216,000 x 108,000 = 23,328,000,000

		- You can just skip the 0 in the 108 and start multiplying the digit in the hundreds place
		- 6 spare 0s
- 5,300,000 x 1,615,000 = 8,559,500,000,000
