- Review
	- $a^m = \underbrace {a \times a \times a ... \times a}_\text{m times}$
	- - $a^m \times a^n = a^{m + n}$ 
	- $a^m \div a^n = a^{m - n}$ 
	- $a^0 = 1$ ($0^m = 0$)
	- $0^0 = ?$ 


### Limits
- Initially heading towards 0

| Expression  | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| $1^1$       | 1.000 |
| $0.9^{0.9}$ | 0.909 |
| $0.8^{0.8}$ | 0.836 |
| $0.7^{0.7}$ | 0.779 |
| $0.6^{0.6}$ | 0.736 |
| $0.5^{0.5}$ | 0.707 |
| $0.4^{0.4}$ | 0.693 |

- Now heading towards 1

|                       | Value         |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| $0.3^{0.3}$           | 0.696         |
| $0.2^{0.2}$           | 0.724         |
| $0.1^{0.1}$           | 0.793         |
| $0.05^{0.05}$         | 0.860         |
| $0.02^{0.02}$         | 0.924         |
| $0.01^{0.01}$         | 0.954         |
| $0.001^{0.001}$       | 0.993         |
| $0.0001^{0.0001}$     | 0.99907939... |
| $0.00001^{0.00001}$   | 0.99988487... |
| $0.000001^{0.000001}$ | 0.99998618... |

- Best we can say is $0^0 = 1$


- $\lim_{x\to 0} x^x = 1$
	- The limit as x approaches 0 = 1
