- In 2005, there were 1000 rabbits on an island. The population grows 8% every year. At this rate, how many rabbits will there be on the island by 2020?

	- Exponential growth problem because the population is growing
	- Generic form of exponential growth
		- $y=a(b)^x$ 
			- a = initial population
			- b = $(1+R)^t$ since we're dealing with time
	- To convert a percentage to a decimal, divide by 100
- The value of a new car in 2015 was $40,000. It depreciates 7% each year. How much will the car be worth in 2024?
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 3.26.01 AM.png]]
	- Exponential decay problem because the value of the car is decreasing
		- $y = a(1-R)^t$ 
			- a = initial value
			- 9 years difference
- John bought a new home in 2002. The value of the home increases 4% each year. If the price of the house is $225,000 in 2015, how much did he pay for it in 2002?

	- $y =a(1 + R)^t$ 
		- The y represents the future value and the a represents the past
- A sample contains 1000 counts of bacteria. The bacteria doubles every 20 minutes. At this rate, how many counts of bacteria will there be in 3 hours?
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 3.30.05 AM.png]]
	- $y = a(b)^x$ 
		- The a is the initial value
		- The b is the growth
			- Since it doubles, b = 2
		- n is the number of times it doubles in an hour
- A sample contains 100 counts of bacteria. The bacteria triples every 15 minutes. (a) How much bacteria will there be in an hour? (b) How long will it take for the sample to contain 500 millions counts of bacteria?
	- a) ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 3.31.29 AM.png]]
		- 8100 bacteria in a single hour
	- b) ![[Screenshot 2022-12-27 at 3.35.37 AM.png]]
		- Need to use logarithms to solve for t
