- The multiples of a number are the numbers that can be divided evenly by the number we've been given
- List the first 5 multiples
	- 1
		- $1*1=1$
		- $1*2=2$
		- $1*3=3$
		- $1*4=4$
		- $1*5=5$
		- The results found are multiples of 1
			- True because you can divide all the results by 1 to get a whole number answer
	- 3
		- $3*1=3$
		- $3*2=6$
		- $3*3=9$
		- $3*4=12$
		- $3*5=15$
	- 12
		- $12*1=12$
		- $12*2=24$
		- $12*3=36$
		- $12*4=48$
		- $12*5=60$
		- As long as you can take the multiple and divide it by the original number and get a whole number answer, you know that it's a multiple of the original number
	- 20
		- $20*1=20$
		- $20*2=40$
		- $20*3=60$
		- $20*4=80$
		- $20*5=100$
