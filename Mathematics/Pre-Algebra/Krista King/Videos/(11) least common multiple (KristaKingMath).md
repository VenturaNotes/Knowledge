- Find the least common multiple of a set of numbers
- Least common multiple means that both of the numbers we're given will divide into evenly

		- In order to find the least common multiple across 3 numbers, find their product of primes and use the largest base in each group multiplied by each other to get it
			- $2^3 * 3 = 24$ 
			- $2 * 5 = 10$ 
			- $3 * 5 = 15$ 
				- Use $2^3$ from first group, 3 from any group with a 3, and 5 from any group with a 5
		- Prove it by dividing 120 across the other numbers
