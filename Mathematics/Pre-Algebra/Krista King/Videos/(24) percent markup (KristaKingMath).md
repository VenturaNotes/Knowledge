## Intro
- Every time you go into a store to buy something, the price that you pay for includes the amount of money that the business spends to buy the item + a markup. If they didn't add a markup in, they wouldn't make any profit. If a business sells an item for $100 that they bought for $100, the business would not make any profit

## Example
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-30 at 3.16.41 AM.png]]
- Find the selling price
	- Reminder: s = p + m
		- p = Price
		- s = selling price
		- m = markup
	- 40% of s is 0.4s
- When solving $\frac {1800} {0.6}$, do decimal division. Need to move the decimal 1 to the right.
- Check the solution in the end to make sure the markup is 40% of the selling price.
