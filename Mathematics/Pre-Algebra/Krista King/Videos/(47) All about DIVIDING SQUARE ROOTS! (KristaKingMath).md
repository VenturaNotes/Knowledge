	- Simplify the radical expression
	- Reminder: $\frac {\sqrt a} {\sqrt{b}}$= $\sqrt \frac ab$ 
	- Square root rule
		- $\sqrt{ab}$ = $\sqrt a \sqrt b$ 
	- You never want to leave a square root in the denominator of your answer.
		- Rationalizing the denominator is when you multiply the radical in the denominator by that radical in both the numerator and denominator.
