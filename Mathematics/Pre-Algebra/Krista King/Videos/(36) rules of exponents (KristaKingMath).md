	- Simplify the expression
	- Expanding $x^4$ is xxxx and collapsing it gives $x^4$ 
	- Base and exponent must be the same to be added and subtracted together to combine them as like terms
	- When multiplying values where exponents are involved, we just care that the bases are the same. Exponents don't need to be the same. You just add the exponents together
		- $x^ax^b = x^{a+b}$ 
	- Quotient rule for exponents
		- When dividing, we need the same base but not the same exponents. Subtract exponent in denominator from the exponent in the numerator
	- Power rule for exponents
		- $(x^a)^b = x^{ab}$
