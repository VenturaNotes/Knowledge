- signed numbers are just a number that has a sign (positive or negative number). All numbers are signed numbers
	- This is not necessarily true in ordinary arithmetic as the number 0 does not have a sign [^1]
- Simplify the expressions using the number lines
	- 1 + 3 = 4 (orange color)
		- The + sign indicates we're going in the direction indicated by positive 3 (to the right)
	- -1 + -3 = -4 (yellow color)
		- Same as -1 - 3
	- 2 + -1 = 1 (green)
	- -3 + (+2) + (-2) = -3 (blue)
		- -3 + 2 - 2
		- -3 + 0 (0 is the identity number for addition) = -3
	- -4 - 3 + 2 -4 -3 -2 = -4 + (-3) + 2 + (-4) + (-3) + (-2) = -16 + 2 = -14
		- Able to make everything addition
	- -2 - -3 = 1 (purple)
		- 2 negative signs back to back will cancel and give a positive
		- Subtraction of negative numbers
		- Can be -2 + 3 (pink)
