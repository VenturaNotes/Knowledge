- Absolute value is the distance from the origin
	- which means the result will always be positive
- The two lines are called absolute value brackets or absolute value bars
	- Tells us we're taking the absolute value of whatever is inside them
	- $|2|$ 
		- is read as "the absolute value of 2"
- Simplify the expression
	- $|2|=2$ (orange)
	- $|-2| = 2$ (yellow)
	- $|3-4| = |-1| = 1$ (green)
		- Must simplify inside absolute value bars first
	- $-|4| = -[|4|] = -4$ (blue)
		- The negative is outside the absolute value bars
	- Visuals
