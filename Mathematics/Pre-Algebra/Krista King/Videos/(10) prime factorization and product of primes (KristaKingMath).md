- Find the product of primes by factoring the numbers
- Examples
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 10.08.54 PM.png]]
		- 102
			- Easiest way to start is to divide by 2 when even number
			- $2*3*17$ is the product of primes for 102
		- 84
			- We always want to list our factors in ascending order
		- 24
		- 15
- Goal is to break down number into irreducible prime factors so at the end of each path, you only have prime numbers
	- Then you take all the prime numbers and multiply them together to find the product of primes
