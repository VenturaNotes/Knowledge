- Scientific notation
	- A shorthand way to express very large or small numbers
		- 96,300,000 could be expressed more simply
		- 0.0000023 could be expressed more simply

	- Will always have a decimal multiplied by 10 to an exponent.
	- The exponent is how many spots you move your decimal point
	- The number in front of the decimal must be between 1 and 9
	- The number of significant figures in the scientific notation is given by the number of non-zero digits that you have in your decimal
	- Big numbers useful for astronomy and small numbers useful for biology.
	- If you have a negative number, the negative will just be in front of the decimal sign

## Arithmetic

	- The powers need to be equal
	- You never want to include a 0 in decimal term ^a46f6e

	- We don't want trailing zeros
	- So for significant figures, we end up with $7.191 \times 10^3$

	- Comparing
		- Which is larger?
	- Whichever exponent is larger will be the larger actual number
	- If the exponents are equal, you check which decimal number is larger
