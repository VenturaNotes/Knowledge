	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-25 at 7.51.51 PM.png]]
		- We need to find the common denominator
			- To do this, find lowest common multiple
				- Easiest to do by looking at largest of the 2 numbers. Find the smallest multiple of the larger number that the other number goes into evenly
				- Need to multiply the numerator and denominator with the same number
		- When the denominators are the same, you can add the numerators together to get sum.
		- Always need to make sure the fraction is in lowest terms. They can not have a common factor other than 1.
		- Can use the prime factorization method.
