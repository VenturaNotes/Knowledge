- Signed numbers are numbers with a positive sign or negative sign attached
- Simplify the expressions
	- $2*3$ = 6
		- same signs will be positive
	- $2(-3)$ =-6
		- different signs
	- $(-2)3$ =-6
		- different signs
	- $(-2)(-3)$ = 6
		- same signs
- Table

		- Multiplying positive by positive = positive
		- Multiplying negative by negative = positive
		- Multiplying positive by negative = negative
		- Multiplying negative by positive = negative
	- Logic only applies when multiplying together just 2 signed numbers 
		- If the sign is the same: result is positive
			- For every 2 negative signs you have, they'll cancel each other out when positive
		- If signs different, result is negative
- Examples
	- (-2)(-3)(-3) = (2)(3)(-4) = 6(-4) = -24
	- (-2)(-3)(-4)(-5) = (2)(3)(4)(5) = (6)(20) = 120
- Rule
	- If you have an even number of negatives, product will be positive
		- Even - : +
	- If you have an odd number of negatives, product will be negative
		- Odd - : -
