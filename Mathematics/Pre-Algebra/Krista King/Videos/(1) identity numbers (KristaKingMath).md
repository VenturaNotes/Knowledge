- Identity properties (or identity numbers)
	- There is an identity number for addition and a different identity number for multiplication
- Identity number for addition is 0.
	- Can always add 0 to something and keep its identity (number won't change)
- Identity number for multiplication is 1.
	- Can always multiply 1 to something and keep its identity (number won't change)
- Simplify the expressions
	- Examples 1
		- x+0 = x
		- $x*1$ = x
	- Examples 2
		- 4 + 0 = 4
		- $4 *1 = 4$ 
	- Examples 3
		- 1000 + 0 = 1000
		- $1000 * 1 = 1000
	- Examples 4
		- xyz+0 = xyz
		- $xyz*1 = xyz$
