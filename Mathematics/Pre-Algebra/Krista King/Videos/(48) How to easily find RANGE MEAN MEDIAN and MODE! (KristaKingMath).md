	- Find the range, mean, median and mode of the set 2, 3, 6, 9, 10, 2, 2
		- Range
			- Largest number in set - smallest number in set
		- Mean (average)
			- Add up all numbers in set and divide by number of numbers that we have
		- Median
			- Rearrange set from smallest to largest
			- Find the middle number in this order
				- Good with odd number of numbers
			- If even number of numbers, find the mean of the 2 numbers in the middle
		- Mode
			- Number that occurs most often in a given set
			- If we don't have a number that occurs more than all of the other numbers, we'll just say that the set has no mode. If no stand out number, then "no mode".
