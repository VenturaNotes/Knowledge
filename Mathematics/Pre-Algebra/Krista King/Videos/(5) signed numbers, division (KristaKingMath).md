	- This only applies to 2 numbers
		- Dividing positive with positive gives positive
		- Dividing negative with negative gives negative
		- Dividing positive with negative gives negative
		- Dividing negative with positive gives negative
- Simplify the expressions
	- $6 \div 3 = 2$ 
		- Same signs = positive
		- Same as $\frac{6}{3}=2$ 
		- even # of negative signs
	- $-6 \div 3 = -2$ 
		- different signs = negative
		- odd # of negative signs
		- same as $\frac{-6}{3}=-(\frac 63)$ = -2
			- Factor out negative sign from numerator
			- Must apply negative sign
	- $6 \div -3 = -2$ 
		- different signs = negative
		- odd # of negative signs
		- $\frac{6}{-3}$ = $-(\frac 63) = -2$ 
	- $-6 \div -3 = 2$ 
		- same signs = positive
		- even # of negative signs
		- $\frac{-6}{-3} = \frac{-1}{-1}(\frac 63)=2$ 
- What if we have more than 2 numbers involved?
	- $\frac {(-2)(-3)}{6}$ = $\frac{6}{6} = 1$ 
		- Even number of negative signs
	-  $\frac {(-7)(1)}{7} = \frac {-7}{7} = -1$ 
		- Negative number of negative signs
- Rule
	- An Even number of negative signs will give us a positive quotient
	- An odd number of negative signs will give us a negative quotient
