- Use a number line to simplify the expression
	- 3 and -3
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-13 at 5.49.24 PM.png]]
		- Positive 3 tells us we start at the origin 0 and move to the right in the positive direction 3 units
			- The right is positive and the left is negative
		- -3 is on the opposite side of the origin (0) compared to 3.
	- 1 + -2 = -1

		- Adding a negative is the same as subtracting
		- Go in the direction of the number that follows (+) sign
		- Same as 1 - 2 = -1
	- 1 - -2 = 3

		- 2 negative signs become a positive sign
		- Same as "1 + 2 = 3"
	- 3 + 2 + -5 -3 = -3

		- Doing the arithmetic 5 -5-3 = -3
		- Start at 0 moving 3 right, then 2 right, then back 5 and the back 3.
- The opposite of a number (number we start with $*-1$ )
	- Opposite of 1 is -1
	- Opposite of 2 is -2
		- Multiplying them by -1 gives turns the number opposite
	- Opposite of -10 is 10 ($-10 * -1 = 10$)
- An even number of negative signs is equal to a positive sign
- An odd number of negative signs is equal to a negative
- When simplifying:
	- ---2 = -2
		- By starting with 2 by itself, we start with positive.

		- Proof that 
		- Canceling 2 negative signs and can't cancel last negative sign so just end up with 2
	- ----2 = 2
