- Inductive Reasoning
	- Makes broad generalization from specific observations
		- If you see kids enjoy playing with legos, you may assume that all kids enjoy playing with legos
	- Scientists use it to form hypotheses and theories
	- known as Valid Guess
	- Allows for the conclusion to be false
	- Conclusion formed is called a "conjecture" (idea that may or may not be correct)

- Use inductive reasoning to predict the next number
	- (a) 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, ?
		- Each successive number is an even number
		- $\therefore$ 14
	- (b) 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, ?
		- Based on difference of numbers, the next number is 216

- Example 2: Make a conjecture between the relationship of the size of the resulting number and size of original number
	- (a) Pick a number
	- (b) Multiply the number by 10
	- (c) Add 8 to the product
	- (d) Divide the sum by 2
	- (e) and subtract 4
	- $\therefore$ Given procedure produces a number that is five times the original number

- Example 3: Make a conjecture using inductive reasoning
	- Our conclusion is that "All digits of the product are the same" even though this becomes a false conjecture when $\{x | x \ge 10, x \in \mathbb{Z}^+\}$
