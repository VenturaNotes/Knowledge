- Famous subsets
	- Subsets of the real number system
	- Subset: B is a subset of A if every element in B is also an element of A
		- A: {M, T, W, T, F, S, S}
			- 7 days of the week
		- B: {M, T, W, T, F}
			- Weekdays 
		- B is a subset of A because every element of B is in A
	- The real number system is all the numbers or any of the numbers that can be represented on a number line
		- So if you can draw a number line and approximate where that number should be, then that is a real number
		- A number that is not real is known as an imaginary number

- Subsets of Real Numbers
	- Counting Numbers/Natural Numbers: $\mathbb{N}$ = {1, 2, 3, 4,...}

			- Showing how to draw it
	- Whole Numbers: W = {0, 1, 2, 3, ...}
		- The uppercase W is not universally accepted. Not a fancy "W", just a normal "W"
	- Integers: $\mathbb{Z}$ = {..., -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ...}
		- Whole numbers + additive opposites
		- Does not have a first term

	- Rational Numbers: $\mathbb{Q}$ = {$\frac pq$ | p, q $\in$ integers, q $\notin$ 0}

		- Examples
			- $0.73\overline {73}$ 
			- 0.8
			- $\frac {17} {21}$
	- Irrational Numbers: {n | n $\in$ real numbers and n $\notin$ $\mathbb{Q}$
	- Real Numbers: $\mathbb{R}$ = {x | x can be graphed on a number line}
