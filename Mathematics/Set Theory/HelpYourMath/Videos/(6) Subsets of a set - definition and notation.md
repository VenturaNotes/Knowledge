- Subset of a set
	- A set, A, is a subset of set B if every element of A is also an element of B
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-28 at 2.00.55 PM.png]]
		- A is a subset of B in this example
	- Notation: $A \subseteq B$ 
		- Set A must have less than or the same elements as set B
		- Honestly just think of the less than or equal to symbol $\le$
	- Additional Notation:
		- A $\nsubseteq$ B means that A is not a subset of B.
			- The slash is a negation symbol
	- Every set is a subset of U
	- We can represent subsets within Venn Diagrams
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-28 at 2.03.54 PM.png]]
			- In this case $A \subseteq B$ 
---
- Example
	- Create a Venn diagram given the following information:
		- U = {Devils, Giants, Islanders, Jets, Knicks, Mets, Nets, Rangers, Red Bulls, Yankees}, N = {Giants, Islanders, Jets, Knicks, Mets, Nets, Rangers, Yankees}
		- B = {Mets, Yankees}
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-28 at 2.05.57 PM.png]]
			- In this example, set B is completed contained within set N
- More examples!
	- Write $\subseteq$ or $\nsubseteq$ to make the statement true.
		- {3, 4, 5, 6} _ {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
			- $\nsubseteq$ 
		- $\mathbb{Z}$ _ $\mathbb{Q}$
			- $\subseteq$
		- {4, 8, 12, 16} _ {2, 4, 6, ..., 18, 20}
			- $\subseteq$
		- {1, 2, 3, 4} _ {1, 2, 3, 4}
			- $\subseteq$
---
- Discussion Point
	- The last example showed identical sets. When this is the case, we say the sets are equal to each other.
		- Set A = set B if A $\subseteq$ B and $B \subseteq A$ 
		- For example: R = {a, b, c, d} and B = {a, c, b, d}
		- These two sets are equal
			- R = B
		- In set theory, [[(8) Equal Sets and Equivalent Sets - Don't Memorise|equal and equivalent are not the same thing]].
	- For 2 sets that are equal, they must contain the exact same elements

- A [[proper Subset]]
	- Set A is a <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">proper subset</mark> of set B if A is a subset of B and there is an element in B not in A
	- Notation for proper subset: $\subset$ 
	- Examples: If A = {1, 2} and B = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5} then A $\subset$ B. A $\subseteq$ is also valid.
---
- Example
	- Decide whether $\subset$, $\subseteq$, or both can be placed in the blank to make a true statement
		- {2, 4, 6} _ {2, 4, 6}
			- $\subseteq$ 
		- {June, July} _ {January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October, November, December}
			- $\subset$ and $\subseteq$ 
		- {} _ {1, 2, 99, 100}
			- $\subset$ and $\subseteq$

- The Infamous Null Set
	- It turns out that the Null Set is a subset (and a proper one, for that matter) of every non-empty set
	- Therefore, every non-empty set has at least two subsets, the null set and itself
