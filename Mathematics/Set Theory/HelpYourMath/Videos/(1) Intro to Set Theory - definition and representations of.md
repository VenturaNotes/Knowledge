- What is a set?
	- A set is a collection of objects called elements.
	- Sets can be infinite or finite
	- Sets are given in one of three ways
		- Word description (which always starts with "The set ....")
		- Listing method (always in braces {})
		- Set-builder notation (also always in braces)

				- First shows x such that x is greater than 1
				- Second shows x such that x is an element of the positive set of integers
				- "|" means such that

- How to write sets in its various ways
	- Given the elements 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5:
	- Word description
		- The set of whole numbers less than six
		- The set containing the digits 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
	- Listing Method
		- {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	- Set-Builder Notation
		- {x | x is a whole number less than 6}
		- {x | x < 6 and x $\in$ whole numbers}
			- $\in$ means is an element of
---
- Set-builder notation
	- Looking at the previous example:
		- {x | x is a whole number less than 6}
			- The first x represents any element in the set
			- The | means "such that"
			- The section after describes the elements in the set

- More information about Sets
	- Sets are frequently given one capital letter names except for U.
	- U is the Universal Set which we discuss later

- Example 1
	- Use the listing method to create the set of primary colors. Remember to give your set a name!
		- P = {red, blue, yellow}
- Example 2
	- Give a complete listing of all elements of the set containing the prefect squares less than 50
		- S = {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49}
- Example 3
	- Give a complete listing of all elements of the set of whole numbers less than 0
		- W = {} or W = $\varnothing$ 
	- The null set or the empty set can be represented as $\varnothing$ or {}

- Well-defined sets
	- For a set to be useful, it must be well-defined
	- A well-defined set relies on facts and is unambiguous
	- Ex: The set containing fabulous movies is not well-defined because one person might have When Harry met Sally in the set, while another person many not.
