	- The cardinal number, or cardinality, of a set is the number of elements in that set.
		- We use the notation n(A) to represent the cardinal number
			- n(A) is pronounced "n of A"
		- If A = {1, 2, 5}, then n(A) = 3
	- The intersection of two sets is the set of elements that are in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">both</mark> sets.
		- We use the notation $A \cap B$ to represent the intersection of sets A and B
		- If A = {1, 2, 5} and B = {3, 4, 5} then A $\cap$ B = {5} and n (A $\cap$ B) = 1
	- The union of two sets if the set of elements that are found in either of the given sets (or both).
		- We use the notation $A \cup B$ to represent the union of sets A and B.
		- If A = {1, 2, 5} and B = {3, 4, 5} then $A \cup B$ = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and n (A $\cup$ B) = 5

	- For $n(B \cup C)$, could just do 38-4 to get 34. Finding the complement helps
