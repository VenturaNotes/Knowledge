- Universe of Discourse
	- In the statement of a problem, the stated or implied set of all things under discussion at a given time.
	- U = Universal set
	- In studying reactions to a proposal to give all CUNY professors $40\%$ raises, the universe of discourse would be
		- CUNY professors
		- CUNY staff
		- CUNY administration
		- CUNY students
		- NYC taxpayers
		- NYS taxpayers
	- The above are groups of people that would probably want a say in the matter, so they all together would be considered the universe of discourse

- Universe of Discourse
	- The universe of discourse or universal set is usually represented by U
	- Venn diagrams are commonly used in set theory
		- Founded or invented by John Venn
		- Consists usually of 2 or 3. Very hard to have 4 overlapping circles
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-28 at 1.48.22 PM.png|200]]
		- Rectangle represents the universe
		- We get 4 regions
			- Region 1 is Outside overlapping circles
			- Region 2 is the Overlap (where circles overlap)
			- Region 3 is elements in A but not in B
			- Region 4 is element in B but not in A
		- If A was lowercase a, it would still go in set A?

		- 3 overlapping sets
		- All the regions need to overlap
		- Total of 8 regions

- Venn Diagrams
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-28 at 1.51.14 PM.png]]
	- A Venn diagram is a diagram with overlapping circles (sets) within a universe (rectangle)
	- All the areas of overlapping or not overlapping are called regions
	- Every element in the universe belongs to exactly 1 region

- Example
	- * Let U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}, M ={2, 4, 6, 8, 10}, T = {1, 3, 6, 10}. Draw a Venn diagram to display these sets.
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-28 at 1.53.06 PM.png|300]]
			- Start with overlap (6 and 10)
	- * Let U = {a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h}, A = {a, b, c}, B = {c, e, f, g}, and C = {c, d, f, g}. Draw a Venn diagram to display these sets.

			- h is not an element of set A so you could say that h is in the complement of A

- Venn Diagrams
	- A Venn diagram is a diagram with overlapping circles (sets) within a universe (rectangle)
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-28 at 1.56.24 PM.png]]
		- The area within the universe and not in A is called the complement of A, notated by A'. A' = {x | x $\in$ U and x $\notin$ A}

- Draw a Venn Diagram to represent the following
	- * U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9}, E = {2, 4, 6, 8}, and S = {1, 4, 9}
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-03-28 at 1.59.33 PM.png]]
	- Now use the Venn Diagram to find each set
		- $E'$  = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9}
			- Normally we want the numbers in order
		- $S'$ = {2, 6, 8, 3, 5, 7}
		- $U'$ = {} or $\varnothing$
