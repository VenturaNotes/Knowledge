- Finding Subsets
	- A [[Subsets|subset]] of a given set is a set in which all its elements are also elements of the given set.
	- A [[proper subset]] of a given set is a subset of the given set AND the given set has at least one element not in the subset
	- Logicians are interested in finding all possible subsets of a given set. Let's look at set A, which for now, A = {3, 4}. How many subsets can you find for A?

			- 4 subsets and 3 proper subsets

- Counting Subsets
	- Let's use [[(Video) INDUCTIVE REASONING]] here... what conclusion can we draw about the number of subsets a set containing two elements will have?

		- We see here that for 2 elements, there are 4 subsets

- Counting Sets
	- Find all subsets of each
		- {n, q, r}
			- 3 elements, 7 proper subsets, 8 subsets
		- {s, t, u, v}
			- 4 elements, 15 proper subsets, 16 subsets
- Notice that it's in the form of pascal's triangle

- Ack... isn't there a shortcut?
	- Can you find the formula to determine the number of sets??
	- The # of subsets = $2^n$, n is the cardinal number of the set
	- The # of proper subsets = $(2^n)-1$

- Example
	- How many subsets would the following set have?
		- {11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18}
			- $2^8 = 256$
	- How many proper subsets would the following set have?
		- {a, e, i, o, u, y}
			- $2^6 - 1 = 63$
	- How many proper subsets would set H have given n(H) = 11?
		- $2^{11} - 1 = 2047$

- Putting it all together!
	- Given U = $\{x | x \in \mathbb{N} \text{ and } x < 10\}$, A = {1, 2, 3}, and B = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7}
		- Draw a Venn diagram to represent this universe
	- List all the proper subsets of A
	- How many subsets does B have?
	- How many proper subsets does B have?
	- Find A'
	- Fill in the blanks
		- 1 _ A
		- B _ A
