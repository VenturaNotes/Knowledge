- [[Cartesian products]]
	- The cartesian products of sets A and B is the set as follows:
		- $A \times B = \{(a,b) | a \in A \text { and } b \in B\}$
	- We can pair up elements from different sets, we write them in ordered pairs
		- In an ordered pair (a, b), a is called the first component and b is called the second component
		- In general, (a, b) $\ne$ (b, a)
		- Order matters, so (4, 6) $\ne$ (6, 4)

- More examples
	- The cardinal number of M is 4 and the cardinal number of N is 2
		- n(M) = 4
		- n(N) = 2
		- n(P) = 3
- Cartesian products are unique because each element is itself an ordered pair
