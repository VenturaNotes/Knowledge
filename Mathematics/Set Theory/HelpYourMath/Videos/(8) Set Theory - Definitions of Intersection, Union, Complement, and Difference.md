- [[Intersection of Sets]]
	- The intersection of sets A and B is the set of elements contained in both set A and set B
		- Notation: The intersection of sets A and B is denoted by A $\cap$ B and read A intersect B
		- Ex: If A = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9} and B = {1, 4, 9} then
	- The Venn diagram representation of the intersection

- Examples!
	- Find each intersection
	- {A} is saying that A itself is an element which is wrong because it's a set
		- The intersections of A and B is set A itself. Therefore, writing "A" is a valid solution

- [[Union of sets]]
	- The union of two sets A and B is the set of all unique elements belonging to either set A or set B (or both)
		- Notation: A $\cup$ B reads "A union B"
		- Example:
	- The Venn diagram representation of the union

- Examples!
	- Preferably put the elements of the union in order

- Finding [[complements]]
	- Recall that the complement of a set A, denoted A', is the set of all elements in U that are not in A
---
- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-13 at 7.21.09 AM.png|500]]
- Examples!
	- Given U, A, and B
	- Find A'
	- Find B'

- [[Difference of sets]]
	- The difference of sets A and B is the set of all elements in A that are not in set B
		- Notation
		- For example
		- The Venn diagram representation of the difference of sets A and B
---

- Examples!
	- Given
	- Find A - B.
	- Find B - A

- Review of Set Operations
	- The complement of set A is: A'
		- The set of all elements in U and not in A
	- The intersection of sets A and B is: A $\cap$ B
		- The set containing elements in both sets A and B
	- The union of sets A and B is: A $\cup$ B
		- The set containing elements in set A or set B (or both)
	- The difference of set A and set B: A - B
		- The set of elements in A and not in B
