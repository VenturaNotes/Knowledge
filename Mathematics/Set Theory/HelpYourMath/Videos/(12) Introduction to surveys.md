- Surveys
	- We use surveys to represent sets of people. In this section, the cardinal number of a set plays an important role.
	- The cardinal number of a set is the number of elements in the set.

- Using Cardinal Numbers
	- Set up a Venn diagram using only the number of elements in that region.
	- The four regions of A need to add up to 6 since n(A) = 6
		- Able to find it in the sum

- Surveys
	- We want to fill in a Venn diagram by always starting with the overlap region(s).
	- Language matters
		- If a sentence says: "(some number) like both A and B ..." then this includes people who like A and B and not C, but also people who like A and B and C. This value MUST be subtracted by the triple overlap number
		- If a sentence says: "(some number) like A and B only" then this does not include the triple overlap and this value can be placed into the appropriate region
		- This is also true when it says "(some number) like A." That is the cardinal number in set A and ALL the regions in A should add up to that given value.
	- All the regions (including any floating in U and not in any other set) should add up to the total number in the universe

- Survey - Question 1

	- Results:
		- 28 like Taylor Swift
		- 34 like Bruno Mars
		- 12 like both Taylor Swift and Bruno Mars
		- 4 like neither artist
	- Draw a Venn Diagram to represent the above
	- Answer the following questions based on the Venn Diagram
	- a.) How many people were surveyed total? <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">54</mark>
	- b.) How many people like only Bruno Mars? <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">22</mark>
