- Symbols and Terminology: The cardinality of a set
---
- Cardinal Numbers and Cardinality
	- The cardinality or cardinal number of a finite set is the number of unique elements in the set.
		- Notation is n(A) read "n of A" where A is a set
			- It's asking us how many elements are there in set A
	- Examples! Find the cardinal number of each set
		- B = {1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36}
			- n(B) = 6
		- P = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4, 4 ,4}
			- n(P) = 4
		- N = $\varnothing$
			- n(N) = 0
		- M = {$\varnothing$} (set is containing the empty set which in this case is an element of the outer set)
			- n(M) = 1
		- E = {2, 4, 6, ..., 20, 22}
			- n(E) = 11
			- The 3 dots means that the pattern continues

- Finite and Infinite Sets
	- A finite set is a set that has cardinality
		- The last five sets we saw were all finite sets
	- An infinite set is a set that contains an infinite number of elements
		- The super well-known sets are all infinite sets
			- ($\mathbb{R}, \mathbb{Z}, \mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{N}$)
---
- Examples
	- Is the set finite or infinite?
		- The set of all odd numbers
			- Infinite
		- R = {3, 6, 9, ..., 99,  102}
			- Finite
		- {x | x < 0 and x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$}
			- Infinite
		- The set of real numbers between 0 and 10
			- Infinite

- Wrapping it all up!
	- Think about the set of positive multiples of 4.
		- (a) Name the set: 
			- m (our choice, m could just stand for multiple)
		- (b) Write the set all three ways:
			- Listing Method
				- m = {4, 8, 12, ...}
			- Set-Builder Notation
				- m = {x | x = $4*\mathbb{N}$}
			- Word Form
				- The set of positive multiples of 4
		- (c) Is the set well-defined?
			- Yes
				- Positive numbers of 4 is very well established
		- (d) is the set finite or infinite
			- Infinite so no cardinality
		- (e) Fill in the blank: 
			- 1148 $\underline {\in m}$
		- (f) Fill in the blank: 
			- $\underline {0} \notin m$
