	- [[Superset]]
		- Superset relation is the same as the subset relation but in the opposite direction
	- Example
	- Let A and B be sets. If x $\in$ A for every x $\in$ B, then B is a subset of A and we write $B \subseteq$ A. We also say A is a superset of B and write $A \supseteq B$ 
		- Every set is a superset of the [[empty set]]

	- Give three examples of supersets among these 4 sets
		- A is a superset of B, D is a superset of A, and D is a superset of B. I said to give "three examples of supersets", this is kind of only two examples, but you see what I meant!
			- These are three statements of different superset relations.
