	- U = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
	- S = {1, 2, 3}
		- What isn't in S?
			- The [[absolute complement]] of S is {4, 5}
				- Set of all elements in universal set but not in S
				- Can be denoted as $S' \text{ or } S^c \text{ or } \overline S$
	- $U\backslash S$ is the [[relative complement]] of S in U (or U-S)
		- Refers to the set of elements in the first set not in the second set. 
		- More general notation that you can use with any two sets regardless of whether or not you have a universal set

	- $(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B'$
		- The complement of the union of 2 sets is equal to the intersection of the complement of two sets
	- $(A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'$
		- The complement of the intersection of two sets is equal to the union of the complement of two sets
