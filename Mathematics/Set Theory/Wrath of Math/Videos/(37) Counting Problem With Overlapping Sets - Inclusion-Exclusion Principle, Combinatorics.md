	- Question
		- Village of 150 people
		- 70 subscribe to Samaja
			- Daily newspaper in Odisha India
		- 35 subscribe to Dharitri
			- Another Daily newspaper
		- 15 subscribe to Samaja and Dharitri
		- How many people subscribe to neither?
	- [[Inclusion-Exclusion Principle]]
		- When doing 150 - 70 - 35 = 45, we included the "15 subscribe to Samaja and Dharitri" people twice
			- To correct our answer, we need to subtract 15 from our count.
	- We want to count the number of people in the union of the Samaja and Dharitri sets
