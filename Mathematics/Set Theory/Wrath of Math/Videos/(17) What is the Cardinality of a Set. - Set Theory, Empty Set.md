	- Cardinality of Sets
		- Straight bar around something is often used as a measure of magnitude
		- The cardinality of sets is the number of elements in a set
	- The empty set can be written as $\varnothing$ or { }
		- The cardinality of the empty set is 0 because it has 0 elements.
	- B has a cardinality of 3 because it only contains 3 elements. If a set is an element of a set, it will be counted as 1 element even if the set inside has multiple elements inside itself.
