	- [[Roster Notation]]
	- [[Set-builder notation]]
	- If using absolute value bars in set-builder notation better to use {x: x > 0} than {x | x > 0}
	- Definition of [[odd numbers]] in set-builder notation (both lines are valid representations)
		- {x: $\exists$k$\in$$\mathbb{Z}$, x =2k + 1}
		- {2k + 1: k $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$}

	- [[Modular congruence]]
		- {x | x $\equiv$ 1 mod 2} (modular congruence is defined for integers)
			- Says "congruent"? but seems more equivalence?
			- It means that when x is divided by 2, there is a remainder of 1 left over.
			- Smart to specify x is an integer in first statement.
