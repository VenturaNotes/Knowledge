	- How many elements are in {a, b, c}?
	- The [[Cardinality]] of {a, b, c} is 3
	- n(S) = |S| = 3 if S = {a, b, c}
	- In a [[multiset]], the number of times an element appears is important
		- If M is a multiset, and M = {a, a, b, c, b, a}
			- This is a common notation for multisets {$a^3$, $b^2$, c}
				- We put the [[multiplicity]] of each element in the superscript
					- Multiplicity is the number of times an element occurs
