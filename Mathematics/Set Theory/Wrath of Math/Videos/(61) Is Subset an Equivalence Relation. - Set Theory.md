	- Let A, B, and C be sets
		- [[Equivalence Relation]]
			- True if relation
				- [[reflexive]]: Every set should be a subset of itself
					- Subset relation is reflexive
				- [[transitive]]: 
					- Subset relation is transitive
				- [[symmetric]]: It means if A $\subset$ B, then B $\subset$ A
					- Subset relation not symmetric
			- If subset relation satisfies all 3 of those properties, then it is an equivalence relation
