	- Power sets
		- The set of all subsets of a particular set
		- To check if you wrote all subsets in the power set, do $2^n$ where n is the cardinality of the set.
			- In this case, the cardinality is 3 so the expression should be $2^3$ = 8
			- There is 8 subsets of A
		- Power set of empty set is the set that contains the empty set. 
- Extra [^1]
	- The power set of a set with a single element is the set with the element + the empty set
		- A = {a}
			- P(A) = {$\varnothing$, {a}}
	- The power set of the empty set is just the empty set, but it would then have a cardinality of 1. Otherwise, the empty set itself has a cardinality of 0.
	- A = $\varnothing$
		- P(A) = {$\varnothing$}
		- |P(A)| = 1
