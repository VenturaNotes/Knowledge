	- Let the universal set U be the set of odd positive integers. Let $S = \{x \in U | \text{ }3|x, x^2 > 15\}$. Write S in [[Roster Method|roster form]]
		- Read as "x is an element of the universe such that [[Divisibility|3 divides x]] and $x^2$ is greater than 15"
	- If you're going to use an ellipses to indicate that a pattern continues, you need to be sure that there is a pattern. Must be an obvious pattern

	- Let U = {1, 3, 6, 8, 9, 10} be the universal set, A = {1, 6, 3}, and B = {3, 6, 9}. Write $(A \cap B)^c$ in roster form

	- Let U = $\mathbb{Z}$ be the universal set and $A = \{a \in U | \text{ } 7|a, a\equiv 1 mod 10\}$. Write $A\backslash U$ in roster form
	- $A \backslash U$ ^19ae11
		- The [[set]] of all elements in A that are not in U
	- Solution is { } because all elements of a are in U and A meaning there are no elements in A that are not in U.
