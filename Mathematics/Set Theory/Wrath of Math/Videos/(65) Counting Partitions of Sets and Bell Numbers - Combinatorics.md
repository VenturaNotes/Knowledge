	- Bell's Triangle
	- A [[partition]] of the elements of a set is like a sorting of the elements of the set into <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">disjoint</mark> subsets.
		- If we <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">union</mark> them together, they must produce the original set.
	- Partition a set with 1 element
		- Will use counting numbers for examples
	- The number of ways to partition a set containing 1 element is one That is called a [[Bell Number]], the number of ways of partitioning a set with n elements is the Bell number $B_n$ 
		- $B_1$ is the number of ways of partitioning a set containing 1 element
		- $B_0$ = 1
	- There is currently no nice [[closed formula]] for every bell number but there is a pretty cool [[recurrence relation]]

	- [[Bell's Triangle]]
		- Shows the bell numbers
		- Number of ways to partition a set containing 5 elements is 52
