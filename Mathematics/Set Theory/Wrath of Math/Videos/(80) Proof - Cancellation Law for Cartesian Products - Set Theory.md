	- Suppose that A, B, and C are sets with C $\ne$ $\varnothing$ 
	- Prove that if $A \times C = B \times C, \text{ then } A = B$
	- [[Cancellation Law]]
		- Can't just cross out C because if C were the empty set, and A = {1, 2} and B = {$\pi$}, clearly A $\ne$ B
	- If you take the [[cartesian product]] of an empty set, you get an empty set.
	- Not shown in image, but you would do the blue proof backwards
