	- The cardinality of a power set is $2^n$

	- Above is explanation for why the the cardinality of the power set is $2^n$ 
	- An element can either be included or not included in the subset
	- Try going through this process, of including and not including different elements in your subsets, to find all subsets of a small set like {1, 2}. If this lesson has not made the reasoning clear, this will help you see it in action
