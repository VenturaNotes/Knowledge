	- [[Overlapping Sets]]
		- Neither set can exist entirely within the other set
		- Therefore they cannot be equal
		- More formal definition
			- Sets A and B are overlapping sets if $A \cap B \ne \varnothing, A \nsubseteq B  \text{ and } B \nsubseteq A$
			- Two sets are overlapping if they have some elements in common but neither of them are subsets of the other.
			- Can generalize this with more than 2 sets
