	- A [[set]] is an unordered collection of distinct objects ^a04f9c
		- S = {1, 2, 3}
			- 1, 2, and 3 are the [[members|elements]] of S
			- 4 $\notin$ S means 4 is not an element of S
		- [[Set membership]]: $\in$ is a relation that means "is an element of"
			- We can say $1 \in S$ where 1 is a member of S
	- Elements of a set can be anything
		- $A = \{3, oak, \{1, 2\}, (0, 1)\}$
			- Contains
				- Number 3
				- Type of tree called an oak tree
				- Contains set that contains 1 and 2
					- If the set contains an object that is itself a collection, you don't assume that the objects in that collection are elements of the set 
				- Contains the ordered pair that has 0 then 1
	- Cardinality of a set is the number of elements in a set
		- $|A| = 4$ Denotes cardinality
