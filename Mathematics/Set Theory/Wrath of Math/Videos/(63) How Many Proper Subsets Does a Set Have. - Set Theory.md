	- Talking about finite subsets
	- [[Proper subset]]: Subset of A not equal to A
		- The # of subsets minus # of improper subsets
			- Only 1 improper subset of any given set (which is the set itself)
	- {1, 2} is a proper subset of {1, 2, 3}
	- {1, 2, 3} is not a proper subset of {1, 2, 3}
	- While not common, some people could define a proper subset as a subset not equaling to the original set and that isn't empty
		- Then we'd have 2 improper subsets
	- Number of proper subsets of the empty set = 0
