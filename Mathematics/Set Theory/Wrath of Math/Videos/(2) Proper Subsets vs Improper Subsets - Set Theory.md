- A $\subseteq$ B
	- This means that A may be equal to B
	- Then we say that A is an improper subset of B
	- 3 $\leq$ 3
		- This is like saying that 3 is less than or equal to 3. It could be equal to 3 or just less than.
- A $\subset$ B
	- This means A is a proper subset of B
- Example
	- A = {0, 1}
	- B = {0, 1, 2}
	- A $\subseteq$  B
		- This is not incorrect
	- Since A $\neq$ B we can write
		- A $\subset$ B
			- A is a proper subset of B
			- You know here that A $\neq$ to B
- Example 2
	- A = {0, 1}
	- B = {0, 1}
	- A $\subseteq$ B
	- B $\subseteq$ B
		- Every set is a subset of itself
		- It's an improper subset of itself
	- In order to be a subset, all of your elements need to be in another set.
	- Improper subset
		- If A is an improper subset of B, then A = B
			- (I think just can be?)
- Improper subset
	- $\subseteq$ 
		- This doesn't explicitly mean improper
		- It can mean improper or proper
		- Just say A = B
			- To explicitly say they're improper subsets of each other.
- Proper subset
	- $\subset$ 
	- This means proper
