	- Cartesian product
		- Operation on 2 sets
			- Can be generalized to more than 2 sets
		- The cartesian product of 2 sets is the set containing every possible ordered pair where the first element is from A and the second element is from B
		- Cartesian product is not commutative
		- The cardinality of a cartesian product is equal to the product of the cardinalities of A and B

	- Can use a table to represent the cartesian product as well

	- Visual representation of the cartesian product $\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ 
		- Set of real numbers crossed with the set of real numbers
	- Cartesian plane is this cartesian product

	- Definition in set builder notation
	- $A \times B$ is the set containing all ordered pairs (a, b) such that "a" is an element of set A and "b" is an element of set B
