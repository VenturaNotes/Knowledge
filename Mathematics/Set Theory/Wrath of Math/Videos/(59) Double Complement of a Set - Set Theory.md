	- [[Absolute complement]]: Taking the complement of a set with respect to some universal set
		- Every other set is always a subset of the universal set
	- [[Relative complement]]
	- [[Complement notation]]
		- $A''$ or $A^C$ or $\overline{A}$
			- prime notation, c, or bar notation
	- The double complement of a set is the original set itself
		- A = A''(this is true for absolute complements)
			- Relative complements work a bit differently?
