- [[Set]]
	- Unordered collection of <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">distinct objects</mark>
- {1, 2, 3} = A
	- This is a set
	- Objects in the set are referred to as elements
	- Sets are generally named with capital letters
	- 1,2,3 $\in$ A
		- Means 1, 2, and 3 are elements of A
		- 1 $\in$ A, 2 $\in$ A, 3 $\in$ A
- [[Unordered]]
	- B = {3, 2, 1}
		- B = A because they have the same elements (sets are unordered)
- [[Distinct]]
	- C = {1, 2, 3}
		- 4 dice rolls
			- 1, 2, 3, 1
	- Only distinct elements go in set
	- C = A = B
- [[Objects]]
	- A set doesn't need to contain just numbers
		- Pringle flavors
		- Breeds of dogs
		- D = {$\Large \circ$, ♡, $\triangle$}
			- This sets contains circle, heart, and triangle
			- D $\neq$ A
			- D and A have the same cardinality though
- [[Cardinality]]
	- Number of elements in a set
	- Use the absolute value symbol
	- |A| = 3
		- {1, 2, 3}
	- |B| = 3
		- {3, 2, 1}
	- |D| = 3
		- {$\Large \circ$, ♡, $\triangle$}
- [[Subset|subsets]]
	- E = {1, 2}
	- E $\subseteq$ A
		- All of the element in E are in A
		- All of the element in A are not in E
