	- Practice doing the [[absolute complement]] of sets and [[relative complement]] of sets
	- Absolute Complement = A' = $A^c$ = $\overline {A}$ = U-A
	- $\mathbb{R}$ is the set of real numbers
	- $\mathbb{N} \subseteq \mathbb{R}$
		- Natural numbers is a subset of the real numbers.
		- $U_{i=1}^{\infty} (i, i+1)$  is the union of all intervals from 1 to 2 noninclusive and union up to infinity
