	- [[Power set]]
	- Find power set of [[empty set]]
	- Empty set is a subset of the empty set
	- S = {a, b, c}. Find P(S)
		- If you want to check your progress in the middle of listing out subsets, you can use a [[binomial coefficient]] to do that.
		- How many subsets of S are there that have 2 elements?
			- The number of 2 element subsets of S is the number of ways we can pick 2 objects from a collection of 3 objects since S has 3 elements.
				- This is the binomial coefficient $3 \choose 2$ = $\frac {3!}{2! (3-2)!} = 3$
					- Which means you use the [[combination]] formula
