	- How many subsets of a given set contain a particular set of elements
	- Total number of subsets is $2^n$
		- where n is the number of elements in the set
	- How many subsets of A contain the elements 4 and 5?
		- Could rephrase the question
			- how many subsets of A contain all of the elements of x
			- How many subsets of A is x also a subset of

	- Given $A = \{a_1, a_2, a_3, ..., a_n\}$ meaning it's a finite set
		- $x \subseteq A$
			- Take an arbitrary subset of A
		- We only have one choice for all of those elements that we're guaranteeing we'll include.   
			- $|x|$ is the number of elements that we only have one choice for. We are guaranteeing we'll include them.
		- The number of subsets of A containing all elements of x is $2^{n-|x|}$
			- Total number of subsets of A guaranteed to contain elements of the empty set. Not guaranteed anything because the empty set has no elements
			- Guaranteeing that your subsets must include the elements of the empty set doesn't reduce the number of subsets at all because the empty set has no elements
	- Practice (right image)
		- Answer is 12 because $2^{4-2}$ = 4
		- Given $S = \{x, y, z, w\}$ and $R = \{y,z\}$
			- Subsets of S ($2^4 = 16$)
				- $\{\}$
				- $\{x\}, \{y\}, \{z\},\{w\}$
				- $\{x, y\}, \{x, z\}, \{x, w\}, \textcolor{hotpink}{\{y, z\}}, \{y, w\}, \{z, w\}$
				- $\textcolor{hotpink}{\{x,y,z\}},\{x,y,w\},\{x,z,w\},\textcolor{hotpink}{\{y,z,w\}}$
				- $\textcolor{hotpink}{\{x,y,z,w\}}$
			- The ones colored in hot pink are the solutions to the number of subsets that contain y and z
