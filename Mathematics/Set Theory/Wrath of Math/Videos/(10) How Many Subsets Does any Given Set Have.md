	- $\varnothing$ 
		- Empty set is a subset of all sets
		- The empty set is a subset, not necessarily an element of any set. The cardinality of a finite set is the number of elements it contains [^1]
	- Every set is a subset of itself
	- $2^n$ gives the number of subsets of a set
		- n is the number of elements in the set (cardinality)
