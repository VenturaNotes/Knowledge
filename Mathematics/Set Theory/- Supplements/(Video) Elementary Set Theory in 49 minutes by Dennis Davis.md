	- Definition
		- Set: Collection of objects "elements" or "members"
		- Identified by capital letters
	- Roster notation
		- List each element of the set inside curly braces
	- Set Examples
		- Elements can be numbers, people, objects, or even other sets
	- Set Elements are Unique
	- Set Elements are unordered
		- When sets consists of numbers, they're usually listed in order (to make membership clear)
	- Roster Notation
		- Can be inconvenient for large sets
		- We can abbreviate large numeric sets that have a clear unambiguous pattern
		- ... (ellipses character) 
			- Substitutes part of the pattern
		- An ellipses at end of series means pattern continues forever
		- [[Infinite sets]] have an infinite number of elements
		- [[Finite sets]] have a finite number of elements
	- Description Notation (needs to be precise and unmistakable)
		- We can define a set by describing its elements within curly braces
			- Calendar months
			- People who have walked on the moon
			- Integers from 1 to 1000
		- "good song" is not a well-defined set
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-17 at 12.18.54 AM.png]]
	- Special Sets
		- Pre-defined sets we can use and reference.
			- The set that has no elements
				- $\varnothing$ "[[empty set]]" or "null set"
				- $\varnothing$ = {}
			- The set that contains every element.. every element of interest
				- Examples: set of all students in a school, the set of all rational numbers, set of 5 card poker hands
					- U "[[Universal set]]"
						- Using capital U
		- Pre-defined numeric sets
			- specific font: blackboard font
			- $\mathbb{R}$ = {[[real numbers]]}
			- $\mathbb{Q}$ = {[[rational numbers]]} ^eac86e
				- q is for quotient
			- $\mathbb{N}$ = {[[Natural Numbers]]} ^53cc8b
				- Some might think 0 is a natural number
			- $\mathbb{C}$ = {[[complex numbers]]}
				- numeric sets most likely to encounter
	- [[Cardinality]] ^085ddd
		- Number of elements in a set
			- Absolute value bar of |B| means magnitude or size of B
			- $|\varnothing|$ = 0
				- [[Identity]]: Statement that's always true
			- Denoted
				- $|B| = 4$
				- $n(B) =4$
				- $\# B = 4$
		- {$\varnothing$} not the empty set
			- Set containing the empty set
			- $|\{\varnothing\}|$ = 1
	- Set Membership
		- 3 $\in$ C
			- 3 is an element of Set C
			- is a member of
			- is in
		- $3 \not\in C$ 
			- 3 is not an element of Set C
		- C $\ni$ 3: Set C contains element 3
		- C $\not\ni$ 3: Set C does not contain element 3
	- Set Builder Notation
		- A = {x : x $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$, x < 6}
			- x is a member of the set as long as it meets specific conditions
			- Set A is the set of all x such that x is in the set of natural numbers and x is less than 6
			- Set labels are uppercase and variables usually lowercase x
			- If working with [[complex numbers]], conventional to use lower case z instead of lowercase x
				- Not required but a convention
		- B = {x : x $\le$ 5}
			- If the type of number we intend for x is not clear from the environment, study, or problem being investigated, then we need to specify the type
				- natural numbers?
				- integers?
				- real numbers?
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-17 at 10.37.12 AM.png]]
	- Set Builder Notation
		- B = {x: x $\le$ 5}
			- "All"x
		- B = {x $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$ : x $\le$ 5}
			- "natural" x
		- B = {x $\in$ $\mathbb{Z}$: x $\le$ 5}
			- The type of number is such a fundamental attribute of set B, it has a special place in front of the such that. Not wrong to specify the number type after such that. Only needed if context is not already clear
		- Can combine description definitions with set-builder notation
			- compatible with natural language specification
		- Use "OR" when listing conditions where only one needs to be satisfied
	- Complement of a Set
		- Set of elements that are not in the set
		- Complement of empty set is universal set and vice versa
	- Venn Diagrams (capital V)
		- U is usually drawn at one of the corners
	- Subset
		- If every element of A is also an element of B... then A is a subset of B
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-17 at 10.50.48 AM.png]]
	- Subset
		- [[Subset Identities]]
			- Every set is a subset of itself
			- Empty set is a subset of every set
			- Every set is a subset of the universal set
	- Superset
		- If A is a subset of B, then B is a superset of A
		- A superset contains all elements of another set
		- [[Superset Identities]]
			- Equal sets are supersets of each other
			- every set is a superset of itself
			- Every set is a superset of the empty set
			- the universal set is a superset of every set
	- Proper subset: "A strictly smaller subset" ($\subset$)
		- When A is a subset of B but not equal to B, it is a proper subset of B
		- Proper supersets exist too
	- Interval Notation
		- Shortened form of Set Builder Notation for continuous ranges of real numbers $\mathbb{R}$
		- [[Closed Interval]]
		- [[Open Interval]]
		- [[Half-open Interval]]
			- 1 parenthesis and 1 square bracket on the appropriate sides of the expression
		- We can use interval notation anywhere we would reference a set
			- Interval notation is a compact way to reference or define sets of continuous Real numbers over a range
	- Set Operations
		- Create new sets from existing sets (similar to arithmetic operations)
		- [[Binary set operations]] operate on two sets
		- [[Unary set operations]] operate on one set
			- complement: $A^c$ = Set of elements not in Set A
		- Cardinality is not a set operation because it doesn't result in a set
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-17 at 11.11.04 AM.png]]
	- Set Operations: Intersection
		- Venn Diagrams show the relationship between sets. Not the relative sizes of the sets
		- [[Intersection Identities]] ^ad1d83
			- A $\cap$ A = A
				- The intersection of a set with itself is the set
			- A $\cap$ $\varnothing$ = $\varnothing$ 
			- $A \cap U = A$
		- Obeys commutative operations
			- $A \cap B$ = $B \cap A$
		- Analogous to the logical operator "and"
			- Intersection is sometimes called "A and B" because elements of intersection are in A and B
	- [[Disjoint Sets]]
		- Disjoint sets have no elements in common
		- Their intersection is the empty set
			- No elements in common
	- Set operations: Union
		- Obeys the commutative law
		- [[Union Identities]] ^d1af4a
			- $A \cup A = A$
			- $A \cup \varnothing = A$
			- $A \cup U = U$
	- Memory Aid
		- Intersection is like <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">"n"tersection</mark> and union starts with <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">U</mark>
		- think of a$\cap$n for intersection and oar for union
		- Think that intersection symbol does not catch as many elements as union symbol
	- Intersection, Union Problems
	- Set operations yield sets!
	- Set operations: Relative Complement
		- "A not in B"
		- $A\backslash B$ 
			- "Relative complement of B with respect to A"
		- [[Absolute Complement]]
			- Complement taken against the universal set
		- [[Relative Complement]]
			- Complement taken against some other set
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-17 at 11.23.37 AM.png]]
	- Set Operations: Relative Complement
		- The relative complement operator does not obey the commutative law
		- $A \backslash B = A \cap B^c$
	- Set Operations: [[Symmetric Difference]]
		- A$\Delta$B: "A delta B"
		- A $\oplus$ B: "A xor B"
			- Exclusive or (xor)
				- One or the other but not both
		- "A symmetric difference B"
		- $A \oplus B = (A \cup B) \backslash (A \cap B)$
		- $A \oplus B = (A \backslash B) \cup (B \backslash A)$
		- Symmetric Difference obeys the Commutative Law
			- A $\oplus$ B = B $\oplus$ A
	- Set Operations summary (all obey commutative law besides symmetric difference)
		- Intersection
		- Union
		- Relative Complement
		- Symmetric Difference
	- [[Associative Law]]
		- Intersection set operator obeys the associative law
			- $(F \cap G) \cap S$
		- Union obeys the associative law
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-17 at 12.36.26 PM.png]]
	- Associative Law
		- Exclusive OR obeys as well
	- [[Distributive Law]]
		- Be careful to use parentheses when needed and observe them when present
		- $F \cup G \cap S$
			- This could mean 
			- $(F \cup G) \cap S$ 
			- $F \cup(G \cap S)$
		- Union and Intersection obeys the distributive law
			- Distribute outer term into the parentheses
	- [[De Morgan's Law]]
		- Identities that involve the complements of sets
			- Complement of the union = The intersection of the complements
			- The complement of the intersection = union of the complements
	- Binary set operation
		- [[Cartesian Product]]
			- $A \times B$: "A cross B"
				- Resulting set is the set of pairings. Each of the pairings is an [[ordered pair]].
				- Two items in a specific order, comma-delimited, inside ().
				- May also use angle-brackets $\textlangle \textrangle$.
			- Ordered pairs are not sets
				- {1, 2} set with 1 and 2 elements
					- order does not matter
				- (1, 2) ordered pair 1 followed by 2
					- order matters
			- {(1, 2)} set whose element is one ordered pair
				- an ordered pair is an element
			- $|A \times B| = |A| * |B|$
- ![[Screenshot 2023-06-17 at 1.25.08 PM.png]]
	- Cartesian product
		- Ordered pair on cartesian coordinate system
		- It is called a cartesian coordinate system because the points are the cartesian product of the two real number lines.
		- $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}$ = $\mathbb{R^2}$ which is a 2-D plane
		- $\mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}$ = $\mathbb{R^3}$ which is a 3-D plane
	- [[Power Set]]
		- Unary set operation (meaning it operates only on one set)
		- Written with frilly P so it's not confused with a probability function
			- $\mathcal{P}(S)$
				- Power set of S is the set of all subsets of S
				- Includes empty set and set itself + the other proper subsets
				- Each binary number represents a subset of S
				- Adding an element S doubles the cardinality of the power set
