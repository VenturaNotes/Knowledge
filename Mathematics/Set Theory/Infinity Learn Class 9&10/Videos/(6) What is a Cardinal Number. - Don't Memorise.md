	- A has 3 elements in the set and B has 4 elements in its set
	- The<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;"> number of elements</mark> in a set is known as the [[cardinal number]]
	- n(A) = 3
		- The number of elements in set A is equal to 3
	- n(B) = 4
	- The numbers 3 and 4 are the cardinal numbers of sets A and B respectively
	- Cardinality in mathematics means size. The cardinality of set A is less than the cardinality of set B
