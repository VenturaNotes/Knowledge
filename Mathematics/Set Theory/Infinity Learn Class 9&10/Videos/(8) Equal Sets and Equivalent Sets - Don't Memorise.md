	- Two sets are equal when they have precisely the same elements (implying same number of elements as well)
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Order need not be same</mark>
		- G = H because they have the same elements even if they're in a different order.
	- In order for 2 sets to be equal, they need to have the same cardinality as well as identical elements.
	- If 2 sets are equal, they'll always me equivalent
		- Same cardinal number and same elements
	- If 2 sets are equivalent they may or may not be equal
