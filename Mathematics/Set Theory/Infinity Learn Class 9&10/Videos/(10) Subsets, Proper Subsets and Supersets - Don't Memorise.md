	- Saying "P is a part of Q" is equivalent to "P is a subset of Q"
		- $P \subseteq Q$ 
			- Every element in P also present in Q
	- C $\subseteq$ D because every set is a subset of itself.
		- So $P \subseteq P$ and $Q \subseteq Q$ is valid
		- $C $\not\subset$ D because there is no element in D that is not apart of C
	- $P \subset Q$ indicates [[proper subset]] (or strict subset)
		- It tells us that all elements of P are present in Q but there is at least 1 element in Q which is not present in P
			- 4 and 5 are not present in P in this case but they're present in Q
	- Q $\supset$ P
		- The $\supset$ is used to represent a super set
