- Math 125 (Mathematical Logic) 
	- Talks about the language and rules of formal systems
	- Also semantics and about the language and probability
- Math 135 (Set Theory) more about axioms
	- Will be about axioms part. Will develop the axioms for set theory
	- Axioms for all of mathematics
	- [[Ordinals]] and [[Cardinals]]
- Goal: Develop the foundations for mathematics
- Helps with Formal systems (Have a solid foundation for mathematics)
	- Avoids Paradoxes
		- [[Georg Cantor]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] found paradoxes (reasonings that looked pretty sound but led to contradictions such as the barber paradox)
			- Contradiction Example
				- Let A = {x | x $\notin$ x}
					- Does A $\in$ A?
	- Prove things about Formal Systems
		- Study proofs, theorems, constructions... as mathematic objects
	- Computers can play with Formal systems
		- Computer verification of proof
		- computer assistance for proofs (step by step)
- What is a proof?
	- It's an argument that uses <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">logical steps</mark> to shows that a mathematical <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">statement</mark> follows form certain <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">assumptions</mark>

			- Language: To be explicit by what we mean by a concrete mathematical statements (defines formal language)
				- Symbols: like letters of alphabet
					- Vocabulary
						- Zero, one, plus, times, belongs,
					- Logical symbols
						- equality, and, or, not, exists, for all, variable symbols, parenthesis
				- Grammar: how to put symbols together
					- Grammatical rules
						- 0 and 1 are terms
						- If t and s are terms
							- (t + s) and (t $\times$ s) are terms
							- (t $\in$ s) and (t = s) are formulas
						- If $\varphi$ and $\uppsi$ are formulas, so are:
							- ($\varphi$ $\land$ $\uppsi$ )
							- ($\varphi$ $\lor$ $\uppsi$ )
							- $\lnot \varphi$
							- $\exists x \varphi$
							- $\forall x \varphi$ 
						- For Example
							- Sequence of symbols that makes sense
			- The language is complete: All mathematical statements can be expressed in this language

			- Rules: Explicit logical steps
				- These are the rules of logic that we use when we write proofs
					- $\phi$ pronounced "phi"
					- $\uppsi$ is pronounced "psi"
				- Example: If you can prove -$\phi$, and you can prove $\phi \lor \uppsi$, you can prove $\uppsi$ 
					- We express this rule as
			- Right side just shown as example of rules
			- The rules are complete: [[Gödel's completeness theorem]]:
				- If you can prove something, you can prove it using only these rules
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-05-04 at 10.30.29 PM.png|400]]
			- Axioms: Statements so basic that you cannot prove but basic enough that you don't need to prove it
				- These are statements that describe the very basic behavior of numbers, sets, or whatever you're working with.
				- We will use them as assumptions in our proofs
				- They are supposed to be obviously TRUE
				- We would like them to imply all other truths
				- Example of a list of axioms
					- Standard axioms to work with when working with the natural numbers
					- Also axioms for induction
				- [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]]
					- List of axioms used to axiomatize all of mathematics
			- The axioms are incomplete!
- [[David Hilbert]]
	- Hilberts's program (1900) Russell's dream
		- Find a formal system for mathematics where all true statements can be proved in a purely formal and syntactic way
