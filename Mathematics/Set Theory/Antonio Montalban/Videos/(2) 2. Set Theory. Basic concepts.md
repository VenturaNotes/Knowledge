	- Basic Notions
		- Sets
			- Collection of objects
			- Defining sets - Examples
				- A = {2, 3, 5, 7} (displaying elements)
				- B = the set of prime numbers below 10 (description)
					- Could use [[set-builder notation]] as well 
				- Are A and B equal? YES!
			- [[Principle of Extensionality]]: If two sets have the same elements, they are equal
			- Can be defined differently but can still be equal
				- Order does not matter and also number of occurrences does not matter
			- Belongs symbol: $\in$

	- [[Empty set]]
		- Is the set with no elements
		- Denoted with $\phi$ (phi) 
		- Can there be two different empty sets? No
		- Are $\phi$ and {$\phi$} the same set? No
			- The empty set $\phi$
			- {$\phi$}: the set that contains the empty set

	- [[Inclusion]]
		- Definition: A is a [[subset]] of B (written A $\subseteq$ B)
			- If every member of A is a member of B
		- Example: {2} $\subseteq$ {2, 3}
		- Do not confuse
			- A $\subseteq$ B: A is included in B
				- {2} $\subseteq$ {2,3}
					- 2 $\nsubseteq$ {2, 3}
			- A $\in$ B: A belongs to B
				- {2} $\notin$ {2, 3}
					- 2 $\in$ {2, 3}
		- Observation: If A $\subseteq B$ and $B \subseteq C$ then $A \subseteq C$
		- Is it the case that if A $\in$ B and B $\in$ C, then A $\in$ C?
			- NO!
		- Are there sets A, B, C such that A $\in$ B, B $\in$ C and $A \in C$ ?

	- [[Power set]]
		- The power set of a set A is the set of all subsets of A
			- P(A) = {x | x is a subset of A}
		- Examples
		- P($\phi$) = {$\phi$}
		- Observation: $\phi$ $\subseteq$ B for all sets B
		- Q: If A has n elements, how many elements does P(A) have?
			- $2^n$

	- The set of all sets
		- Is not a set
		- If it was a set, call it V, we would have V $\in$ V
		- Consider B = {x $\in$ V | x $\notin$ x}
			- Does B $\in$ B?
				- B $\in$ B $\iff$ B $\in$ B
					- contradiction!
					- The members of B are the ones that don't belong to themselves. To be a member of B, you have to not belong to yourself
		- We'll call this a class informally. In [[ZFC]], we are just not allowed to talk about the class of all sets
			- It is not an object in the universe.

	- The universe of all sets (atoms are things that are not sets)
		- Where are the atoms coming from?
			- In ZFC, we have no atoms
