	- The language of [[first order logic]] (not that complicated)
		- The formulas of first order logic are going to be strings of symbols built using certain rules
	- Symbols
		- [[Logical symbols]]
			- [[equality]]: =
			- [[Connectives]]: &, $\lor$, $\iff$, $\implies$, $\lnot$, $\forall$, $\exists$
				- and, or, iff, implies, not, for all, exists
			- [[Variable symbols]]: $v_0$, $v_1$, $v_2$, $v_3$, $v_4$ 
				- Better to use x, y, z
			- [[Punctuation Symbols]]: (, )
				- Help us parse the formula
	- [[Vocabulary]]: {$c_0$,$c_1$..., $f_0$, $f_1$, ..., $R_0$, $R_1$, ...} varies
		- Examples
			- Vocabulary of [[groups]]: e, $*$,$^{-1}$ (understanding algebraic structures)
				- e for identity
				- $*$: Multiplication or operation symbol
				- $^{-1}$: Unit operation that takes an inverse (takes elements and maps it to the inverse)
					- In a group you must always have an inverse
			- Vocabulary of [[fields]]: 0, 1, +, $*$
				- Algebraic structures (understand the logical properties of certain types of structures)
				- That's what an area of logical model theory does
			- Vocabulary of [[arithmetic]]: 0, 1, +, $\times$, $\le$ 
				- Analyze the natural numbers (more restrictive in comparison to all of mathematics)
			- Vocabulary of [[set theory]]: $\in$ (if you want to develop all of mathematics, set theory is the place for you)
				- Just need the symbol for belongs
		- Three types of vocabulary symbols
			- [[Constant symbols]] $c_0, c_1, ... \text{ represent elements}$ such as e, 0, 1
				- ...  means we have an arbitrary number of constant, function, and relation symbols. May have infinitely many of each of them
				- $c_0$ are just symbols at the moment. Have no meaning right now
			- [[Function symbols]]: $f_0, f_1, ...$ represent operations $*, ^{-1}, +, \times$
				- plus operation (+) takes two elements and gets one element out
				- Inverse operation takes one element and gives inverse out
				- Functions don't need to be from one element to one, they can take many elements and give you one. There are examples where you may have like three inputs and then output one
				- Takes a fixed number of inputs
			- [[Relation symbols]]: $R_0, R_1, ...$ represent properties of tuples: $\le$, $\in$ 
				- Returns true or false
				- So you apply two objects/elements and then you see if it holds or not
		- Each function and relation symbol has an [[arity]]
			- Each symbol comes associated to an arity that tells you how many elements you can use it for

	- The language of first order logic
		- Terms: Strings of symbols that represent elements
			- 1 + 1
		- Formulas: strings of symbols that represent statements
			- 1 + 1 $\le$ 0 $\lor$ x = y
	- The following [[term|terms]]
		- $c_0, c_1,...$ all [[constant symbols]] (e, 0, 1)
		- $v_0, v_1, v_2, v_3, v_4,...$ all [[variable symbols]] ($v_3$)
		- $f_i(t_1, ..., t_n)$ where $f_i$ is a n-ary [[Function symbols|function symbol]], and $t_1, ..., t_n$ are terms
			- +($v_2$, 0)
				- same thing as $v_2$ + 0
			- -1($v_2$, 0) could mean for inverse
			- Will end up with a long string of characters
	- The following are [[atomic Formulas]]
		- $t_1 = t_2$ where $t_1, t_2$ are terms
		- $R_i(t_1, ..., t_n)$ where $R_i$ is a n-ary function symbol, and $t_1, ..., t_n$ are terms
			- You put symbol for relation, parentheses, and then symbol for terms, then closed parentheses
	- The following are [[Formulas]]
		- All atomic formulas
		- $\lnot \varphi$ where $\varphi$ is a formula
		- where $\varphi$ and $\psi$ are formulas
		- where $\varphi$ is a formula
