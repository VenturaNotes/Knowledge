	- [[Functions]]
		- Building functions from sets
		- A function takes your input and gives you an output
	- Not every relation is a function
	- Definition: a [[function]] F is a relation such that $\forall x \in \text{dom}(F)$, there is a unique y at $<x,y> \in F$. We call this unique y, the value of F at x. We denote it by F(x)
	- We say F is a function from A to B
		- F maps A to B
		- Write F: A $\to$ B
	- If ran(F) = B, we say that F is onto B
		- Every function is onto ints own range
	- F is [[one-to-one]] if whenever F(x) = F(z) we have x=z
