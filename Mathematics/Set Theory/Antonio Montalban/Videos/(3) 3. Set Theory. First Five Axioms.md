	- Errata
		- A = B for last part of extensionality axiom
	- Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms for Set Theory (ZFC)
	- Setting: In ZFC, all objects are sets.
		- Language: $\in$
			- Belongs
		- Logical symbols: =, &, $\iff$, $\implies$, $\lnot$, $\forall$, $\exists$
		- Variable symbols: x, y, u, v, A, B,... all represent sets.
	- [[Extensionality Axiom]] (what it means for two sets to be equal)
		- If two sets have exactly the same members, they are equal:
	- [[Empty Set Axiom]]
		- There is a set having no members (denoted by $\phi$)
	- [[Pairing axiom]] (contains sets u and v as members)
		- For any sets u and v, there is a set having as members just u and v
		- Example
			- Given u = {2, 3} and v = {3, 5}
				- {u, v} = {{2, 3}, {3, 5}}
	- [[Union Axiom]] (preliminary form) (a set that is a union of a and b)
		- For any sets a and b, there is a set whose members are those sets belonging either to a or to b (or to both)
		- B = a $\cup$ B
		- Example
			-  Given u = {2, 3} and v = {3, 5}
				- u $\cup$ v = {2, 3, 5}
	- [[Power Set Axiom]]
		- For any set a, there is a set whose members are exactly the subsets of a 
		- Definition of subset: every member of x is a member of a
		- B = P(a)
