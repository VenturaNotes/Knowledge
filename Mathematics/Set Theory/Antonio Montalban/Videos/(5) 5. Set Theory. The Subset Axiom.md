	- The [[subset axiom]]
	- [[Subset axiom scheme]]: For any set A, there is a subset B whose members are the members of A that satisfy a given condition
	- Notation B = {x $\in$ A | x satisfies the given condition}
		- Example: {x $\in$ $\mathbb{N}$ | x is prime}

	- What kind of condition can we use?
		- x can't be defined in less than 20 words (won't work because it is not a first-order formula)
			- You could create a contradiction by saying "n is the least natural number that can't be defined in less than 20 words"
				- Here it shows 14 words which would make it an element of A, but the statement itself would make it an element of A.
		- Condition needs to be a mathematical property
	- Any condition that can be written as a [[first-order formula]] in the vocabulary {$\in$}
		- For each-first order formula $\psi$(x), we have an instance of the subset axiom
			- $\forall A \exists B \forall x (x \in B \iff (x \in A \text{ \& } \psi(x)))$
				- Given a set A, we can define a subset of A called B whose members are exactly those that belong to A and satisfy the formula $\psi$ 
	- This is why we called it a "scheme" because it contains many axioms inside (one for each formula that you can write)
