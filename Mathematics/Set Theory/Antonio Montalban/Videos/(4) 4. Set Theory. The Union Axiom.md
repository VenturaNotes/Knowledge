	- The [[union axiom]]
		- Union axiom (general form): for any set A, there is a set whose members are those sets belonging the sets inside A
			- Allows us to union any number of sets
		- We denote this set as B = $\cup$A
		- The members of $\cup A$ are the members of the members of A.
			- Example
		- Definition: Given a set A, we define $\cap$A, to be the intersection of the sets in A.
			- Need [[subset axiom]] to prove that $\cap A$ exists
