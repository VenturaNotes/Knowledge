	- [[Direction]] of a vector
		- The direction of a vector is the angle that the vector makes with the horizontal
		- Will denote the angle by the greek letter $\theta$ 
			- Will use [[trigonometry]] where opposite and adjacent is tangent
			- tan $\theta$ = $\frac yx$ 
				- To solve for theta, just take the tangent inverse
			- To get angle of vector
				- $\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac yx)$
					- Then put in calculator and we get angle of vector
