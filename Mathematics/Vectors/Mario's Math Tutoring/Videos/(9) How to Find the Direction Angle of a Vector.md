	- Slide 1
		- Formula
			- $\theta = tan^{-1}(\frac yx)$ 
		- How to find the direction angle of a vector
			- When finding the direction angle of a vector, you want to find the angle that the vector makes with the positive x-axis measured counterclockwise. Positive angle
		- Sometimes the formula can give us the wrong answer (such as -59$\degree$)
		- (2) Second problem is just written in the linear combination form of the standard unit normal vectors $i$ and $j$ 
			- $i$ is in the x-direction
			- $j$ is in the y-direction
			- In this example, you needed to add $180\degree$ 
				- This is because the tangent inverse is always restricted to $-\frac {\pi}{2}$ to $\frac \pi 2$. Will always yield one answer so it's a function
		- Important to sketch it to make sure you get the correct angle
	- Slide 2
		- Need to add 180$\degree$ again for this problem
