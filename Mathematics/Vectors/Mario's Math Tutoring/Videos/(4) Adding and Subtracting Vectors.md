	- Adding & Subtracting Vectors
		- $\vec u = <3, 1>$
		- $\vec v = <-4, 2>$ 
		- Can put vectors together where one ends and another begins. Here, we get the [[resultant vector]]
		- Subtracting vector means opposite direction of vector
	- [[Scalar multiplication]]
		- Multiplying a vector by a scalar
			- Just need to multiply the x and y components by 3
