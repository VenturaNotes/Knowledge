	- Component form of a [[vector]]
		- A [[vector]] is represented by an arrow with both magnitude (length or how long the vector is) and also by direction (angle, which way the vector is pointing, where the force is being exerted for example)
		- Two points in a [[coordinate plane]]
			- Want to find vector that goes from one point to the next
			- We have initial point (starting point) and terminal point (where it stops)
		- Take terminal point - initial point to get component form of vector
			- $<5, 2>$
				- Means you go right 5, up 2
				- Using triangular brackets to differentiate from a coordinate point which uses parentheses
				- Drawing this anywhere on graph will be equivalent as they all have the same horizontal and vertical distance
					- Don't want to make vector longer or change direction
		- As long as the vectors have the same component form, the vectors are equivalent. 
			- Means the forces are exerted in the same direction with same amount of magnitude
