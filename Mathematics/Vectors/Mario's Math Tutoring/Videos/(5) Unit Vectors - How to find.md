	- Finding a [[Unit vector]]
		- Just a vector that has a unit or length of 1 
			- 1 unit or 1 unit long
			- We want the vector to go in the same direction as $<3, 4>$ 
				- We take the vector $\vec v$ divided by the magnitude of $\vec v$ 
					- $\frac {\vec v}{||\vec v||}$ 
					- This will give the unit vector $<\frac 35, \frac 45>$ 
						- To prove this is a unit vector, just use the $\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}$ formula
