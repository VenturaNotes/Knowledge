	- A plane is traveling at 400 miles per hour at a [[bearing]] of 200$\degree$ when a 30 mph wind starts blowing out of the west. Find the resultant speed and direction of the plane
		- When you find the bearing, you want to start facing north and go clockwise of whatever the bearing is
			- Could write bearing as $S18.86\degree W$  or $195.86 \degree$ (the reader will know the latter term to be clockwise from north)
		- "wind starts blowing out of the west" means it's heading east
		- When working with vectors in component form, we have to figure out how to find the angle counterclockwise from the positive x-axis
