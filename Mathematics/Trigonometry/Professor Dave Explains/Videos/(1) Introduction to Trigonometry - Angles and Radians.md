	- After geometry and algebra
	- Let's review some angles
	- Measuring Angles in Radians
		- 2 Coterminal rays: they start at the same point and then go on indefinitely in different directions
		- $\theta$ represents an angle
			- Greek letter theta
		- To describe angle, we often use a coordinate plane
		- One ray on x-axis
			- Location of other ray will determine magnitude of the angle
		- Counterclockwise is a positive angle
		- Clockwise is a negative angle
		- We are used to measuring angles using degrees
			- There are $360\degree$ in one revolution (which is what we trace as we go around the coordinate plane)
				- Ancient babylonians were approximating a year to be 360 days
					- They also used a counting system Sexagesimal (Base-60)
						- (60 $\times$ 6 = 360)
				- 360 may have been a combination of observation and aesthetics
		- Now we have to learn how to use radians
			- If we have a circle of radius R, and we take two radii to form a sector whereby this arc connects the endpoints of the radii also has a length of R, equal to the radii, the angle between the radii will be one radian
				- A sector with an arc length equal to the radius
