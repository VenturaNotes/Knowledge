- Angle Terminology
	- An [[Angle|angle]] is formed by rotating a ray about its endpoint
	- [[Initial side]] of the angle is the starting position of the ray
	- [[Terminal side]] of the angle is the final position of the ray.
	- [[Vertex]] of the angle is the common endpoint, often named by a capital letter such as A
	- An angle is in <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">standard position</mark> if its vertex is at the origin in the xy-plane, and its initial side is the positive x-axis.
	- The <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">measure</mark> of an angle quantifies the direction and amount of rotation from the initial side to the terminal side
- Ray
- Counterclockwise is positive direction
- Clockwise is negative direction

- Degrees vs Radians
	- A degree measures an angle by equating one full rotation of a ray about its endpoint as $360\degree$
	- Therefore, 1$\degree$ = $\frac {1}{360}$ of a rotation
	- A radian measure comes from the measure of the central angle of a circle that intercepts the arc on a circle with a length equal to the radius of the circle
	- Therefore $\theta$ = $\frac {s}{r}$ = $\frac {circumference}{radius}$ = $\frac {2\pi r}{r}$ = 2$\pi$
	- So the measure of one full revolution in radians is 2$\pi$ and 2$\pi$ = 360$\degree$ or $\pi$ = $180\degree$.

- Converting Between Degrees and Radians
	- From degrees to radians: multiply the degree measure by $\frac {\pi}{180}$
	- From radians to degrees: multiply the radian measure by $\frac {180}{\pi}$
- For radians, there is no unit of measure. It's just a radian
- You do need to label degrees with a symbol though "$\degree$"
	- Unacceptable way to leave solution if you have $\pi$ in the denominator (or in general?)
