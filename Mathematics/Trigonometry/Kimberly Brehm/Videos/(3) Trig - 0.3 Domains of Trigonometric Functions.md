- Sine and Cosine
	- $y = sin x$ and $y = cos x$ have no restrictions on their domain
	- This makes sense given that all coordinates of the unit circle are defined and in the format of ($cosx$, $sinx$)

- Tangent and Secant
	- These functions are undefined for all values of t corresponding to the points $(0, 1)$ and $(0, -1)$ on the unit circle. This occurs from the definitions of these function with "x", or the value of $cos(x)$ is equal to zero
	- Undefined at values x = $\frac {\pi n}{2}, \text{n is odd integer}$

	- Errata
		- Undefined points should be (1, 0) and (-1, 0)
- Cotangent and Cosecant
	- These functions are undefined for all values of t corresponding to the points (1, 0) and (-1, 0) on the unit circle. This occurs from the definitions of these function with "y", or the value of $sin(x)$ is equal to zero.
