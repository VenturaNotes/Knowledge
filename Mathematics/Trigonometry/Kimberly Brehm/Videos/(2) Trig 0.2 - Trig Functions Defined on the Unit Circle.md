	- The Unit Circle is a circle of radius 1 centered at the origin.
	- Each point on the circle satisfies the equation $x^2 + y^2 = 1$
	- Trig functions
		- sin(t) = y,  csc(t) = $\frac 1y$
		- cos(t) = x, sec(t) = $\frac 1x$
		- tan(t) = $\frac yx$, cot(t) = $\frac xy$
	- Sin can be found taking the side opposite the angle divided by the hypotenuse
	- Cosine is adjacent over hypotenuse
	- Tangent is opposite over adjacent

- The Unit Circle
	- We can determine several "special" values of corresponding central angles $\theta$ that are integer multiples of $\frac {\pi}{6}$, $\frac {\pi}{4}$, $\frac {\pi}{3}$ by orienting right triangles on a unit circle within a coordinate system
	- Special Right Triangle (45-45-90)
	- An Isosceles triangle has two base angles that are equal and the sides opposite those angles are equal as well.
		- In this case, x=y
	- $x^2 + y^2$ = 1 because that's every point on the circle

	- The Unit Circle
		- Identify the ordered pair on the unit circle that corresponds to the number $t = \frac {5\pi}{3}$. Then evaluate sin(t) and sec(t)
		- Evaluate cos(t) and tan(t) for $t = -\frac {5\pi}{6}$
	- As long as you memorize the first quadrant, you just need to memorize the nature of the values in the other quadrants

- Evaluating Trig Functions with your TI-84
	- Use a calculator to approximate the function values. Round to 4 decimal places
	- Need to use a calculator when evaluating a trig function that is not a special angle on the unit circle
	- Note
		- $\frac {1}{cos(\pi)} = sec(\pi)$
		- $cos^{-1}(\pi) \ne sec(\pi)$ 
			- $cos^{-1}(0) = arccos(0) = \frac {\pi}{2}$
