	- [[Periodic Functions]]
		- A function f is periodic if f(t+p) = f(t) for some constant p
		- The smallest positive value p for which f is periodic is called the period of f.
		- [[Sine]], [[Cosine|cosine]], [[Cosecant|cosecant]], and [[Secant|secant]] are periodic with period $2\pi$ ^ac0d98
		- [[Tangent]] and [[Cotangent|cotangent]] are periodic with period $\pi$ ^fc1e7a

	- Even/Odd Functions
		- A function f is even if f(x) = f(-x). [[Even Function|Even functions]] are symmetric about the y-axis. ^0078b7
		- A function f is odd if -f(x) = f(-x). [[Odd Function|Odd functions]] are symmetric about the origin. ^de1bc8
		- Cosine and secant are even functions ^71890a
		- Sine, cosecant, tangent and cotangent are odd functions ^432f18

	- Practice
		- Use the unit circle and what we know about period and even/odd functions to evaluate each expression, if possible
