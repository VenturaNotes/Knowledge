## Image Occlusion 2.0
- Installs this add-on. Code is needed
	- This actually has been discontinued. Use "Image Occlusion Enhanced" instead!
- "Add notes with non overlapping occlusions"
	- If you covered 10 terms with a square, 10 flashcards will be made where all the text will be blocked and you will be indicated to answer one of them.
- "Group elements"
	- 2 highlights will popup at the same time
- "Add notes with overlapping occlusions"
	- Only 1 term will be blocked at a time.

## Cram Studying
- Go to deck. Hit custom study. then "study by card state or tag"
	- Do "All cards in random order (cram mode)"
		- Then all the cards in the deck will be in the "custom study session"
		- Then you need to empty deck when done?
- Tools -> Create filtered Deck
	- "deck:MedSchoolInsiders.com"
		- Limit to 10 cards based on order added 
			- "Reschedule cards based on my answers in this deck"
				- This will affect your home deck
- Best to create your own cards since it's part of the active learning process
	- Create and using the cards is much better than if someone else made them
		- (I personally don't believe this since I always scored As on my AP Psychology Tests from high school because a student would make really good flash cards on Quizlet)

## Mobile Device / Smart Phone
- On iPhone, app is pretty pricy for $25 (one-time fee)
- For android it's free
- Price is steep so use free computer program
