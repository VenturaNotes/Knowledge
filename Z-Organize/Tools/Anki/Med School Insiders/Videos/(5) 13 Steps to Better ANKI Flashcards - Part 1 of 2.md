## Intro
- Great for medical students


## 1) Keep your Decks Simple
- Don't have a sub-deck for each week in a class
- This fragmentation complicates the task of reviewing the necessary information
- Create a single deck for a large exam
- Tagged cards by organ system like cardiology or pulmonology
- Checked if they had mnemonic or memory device
- 1) You'll waste less time organizing and structuring your deck
- 2) You'll be in the habit of reviewing the entire deck
- For spaced repetition software like Anki, you must regularly review information
	- Intervals from previous subject much longer meaning it takes less time to maintain already consolidated information. Will understand most everything when the exam comes around

## 2) First Understand, Then Memorize
- Little utility in memorizing a string of information if you're unable to adequately conceptualize and place it within a mental scaffolding
- Less likely to remember and recall
- Less likely to adequately apply the information



## 3) Lay the Foundations First
- Pareto Principle
	- 80% effects comes from 20% of the causes
- Applied to Anki flashcards, it's about being efficient with how you study
	- Focus on the highest yield information
		- To optimize your chances of scoring well
- Foundation of Basics is essential


## 4) Follow the Minimum Information Principle
- Simple is easy
- By sticking with a complex card with multiple sub-items, you're more likely to
	- Forget the More Difficult Sub-item Repeatedly
	- Repeat the card in excessively short intervals
	- Remember only a part of the complex card
- Make it so you have a simplified card with only 1 item

## 5) Cloze Deletions Are Your Best Friend
- Fill in the blank questions
- Minimum Information Principle
	- Great way to break bad habits
- Efficient to create since you can copy notes from powerpoint and create cloze deletion cards in just seconds

## 6) Use Images, Photos, & Figures
- Memory is more efficient at retaining visual than textual information 
- We've evolved over millions of years and only had written language as a small percentage of our existence.
- Images are particularly beneficial for certain subjects
	- Anatomy
	- Chemistry
- Try to find an image related to the concept
	- Even if the image is not related that much to the card but makes you think of it. Greatly reduces your learning time
- Image Occlusion Enhanced
	- Great for blocking certain segments of it

	- If you need help with medical school
