## Intro
- Create 1 deck per test
	- Creating too many card decks will make it difficult to get to everything you need to know
- Basic deck
	- Front and back flashcard
	- Different levels of difficulty
		- Again (< 1 min)
		- Good ( < 10 mins)
		- Easy (< 4 days)
- Cloze deletions
	- Fill in the blank cards
		- Can paste textbook questions
	- "Command + Shift + C" will fill in {{c1: text}} which tells Anki that it's a fill in the blank question
		- You can do it as many times as you'd like
	- Then # after the "c" refers to an individual card.
		- Changing them all to the same # will just count as 1 card with 3 blanks
	- Extra
		- Adding text and images here
			- Images help with recall rate
