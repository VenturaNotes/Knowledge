## Introduction
- First, you don't remember everything you should
- Second, it takes too much time to memorize
- How to
	- Boost your memory
	- Memorize More facts
	- Spend less time doing it

## Imperfect Memory (#HomoSapienProblems)
- Procedural Memory
	- Knowing how to swing a golf club
- Declarative Memory
	- Being able to recite and draw the cervical plexus for you anatomy exam
- Semantic Memory is a type of declarative memory which is going to help us do well on exams
- From examining neural networks in sea snails to caring for amnesia patients with localized lesions, neuroscientists have learned a great deal as to how human memory works and squeeze the most utility out of our hippocampi
	- The hippocampi are the centers of our brain that store long term memory
- Hermann Ebbinghaus 
	- Forgetting Curve

		- It demonstrates that after forming a memory, we gradually forget more and more of it as time elapses
- Retrieving memories is a separate process from storing them 
	- This too is imperfect which is why eye witness reports are notoriously unreliable.
- Neuroscience fundamentals tells us that repetition potentiates neural connections and allows us to remember information more effectively
- Problem is that we have too much information to learn.
- Spacing Effect
	- By repeated exposures to a piece of information at increasing intervals between each repetition, we can optimize memorization and retain the most information in the least amount of time. Key here is that we must recall the information and not recognize it.
