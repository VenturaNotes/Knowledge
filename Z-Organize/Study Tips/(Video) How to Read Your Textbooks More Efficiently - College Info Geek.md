## Personal Thoughts
- Video seemed to focus more on how you'll be assessed on the reading rather than genuinely learning.

## Information from Video
- Get the right information
- Actually remember that information
- Have more time for Smash Bros.
- Reasons why you might do a textbook reading
	- Scantron OCD
	- Create an essay from scratch
		- All the hand cramps
	- Science stuff
	- Summarization of research for class presentations and reports
- If multiple choice test
	- Focus on details of reading assignments
- If essay
	- Focus on summarization to communicate what you learned
- Gauge requirements of classes
- Read for application
- Brain is better at remembering emotionally evocative pictures and imagery than it is at remembering squiggly, arbitrary lines on paper.
- Active Reading
	- Create 2 different habits for textbook readings
		- First read consistently
			- Read daily + write summary
		- Read actively instead of passively
- Input-based habits
	- Fixed amount of effort
		- Such as read for 15 minutes
- Output-based habits
	- Making something concrete
		- Write 1 page of notes
			- Time and effort isn't fixed
- Create a reward for doing the work (to reinforce positive feeling of doing work)
