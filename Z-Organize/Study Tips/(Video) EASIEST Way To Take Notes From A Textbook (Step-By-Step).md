## Notes from Video
- How to take notes
- How to use them effectively
- Utilize for taking quiz and exam
- Step 1: Rethink how you take your notes
	- We try to make the information condensed down into something we can understand
	- Basically transfer from one modality being the textbook to another like an outline or a word doc
	- Question #1  
		- Try to figure out just what is important in what you're reading 
	- Question #2
		- Ask yourself: how do i want to prepare myself to use this textbook and the notes that I'm taking?
- Step 2: Do One Task At A Time
	- Context Switching is bad (20% of energy being used is spent transitioning between the tasks)
		- Such as reading textbook and writing notes at the same time
	- Think about your reading and your NoteTaking completely separately
- Step 3: Mark on Notable Topics/Ideas
	- Read 3-5 paragraphs
	- Make some markings
	- Questions
		- What is noteworthy?
		- What is high yield?
		- How do I know If I'm Reading Something if I should turn this into a note or a piece of detail?
	- Watch this video: [[(Video) How Do you Take Notes For Med School]]
	- Focus on thinking about big ideas and then focusing and honing in on the details
		- Think like a tree with branches
	- Look for what question could come out of what you just read.
	- You'll look at paragraphs not as the test taker but as the test maker
	- Watch a quick YouTube Video to get the foundation of the topic
	- Take notes on something learned in class that you read in the book.
- Step 4: Come back into focus on your note taking
	- Anki great for memorization
	- Simple Notion Method
- Step 5: Give yourself a Timer for each phase
	- How long do you take?
	- How Long your lectures are?
	- How Quick can you read?
	- Take that one hour and cut it by 25 minutes or 25%
- Step 6: Systematically Come Back to Your Notes and Your Review Process As Predictably As Possible
