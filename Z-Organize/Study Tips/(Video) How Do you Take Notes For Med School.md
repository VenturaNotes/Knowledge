- Q&E Method
	- E is evidence
	- Q is Question
- Go through syllabus
- Unhelpful Notes - Zero Motivation
- Ask Big Picture Questions
	- Example
		- Antiarrhythmic Drugs
- What is the biggest piece of information?
- What do I learn first?
	- Refer to titles, transitions & headings for your questions
- Answer questions broadly at the start
	- Add screenshots or drawings
- E = Evidence
	- The notes are quizzing me
- Mark important details, then do Q&E
- Adding additional notes and analogies can help you understand it better (especially if you're not a fan of flashcards)
- Question first approach is great
