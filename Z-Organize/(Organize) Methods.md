- PDF Notes:

Tips:
- In order to search embedded files, just turn the markdown file to "reading mode" instead of "live preview mode"
- Use tags for notes for larger topic ideas?
- Convert all text files to PDF and annotate + import into Zotero. Use brackets method to include drawings within the note as well as needed. Any handwritten notes from OneNote can be embedded as a PNG through a sticky note.
- Use the @ symbol to make references
- Use MathJax for latex notes
