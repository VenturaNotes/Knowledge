urier Transforms, Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors, and Graph Theory

Investigated Fourier transforms, focusing on their applications in signal processing, decomposition of periodic functions, and the transition between time and frequency domains.

Examined eigenvalues and eigenvectors, exploring their significance in linear transformations, diagonalization of matrices, and stability analysis in dynamical systems.

Delved into graph theory, analyzing spanning trees, shortest path algorithms, and the role of adjacency matrices in representing and solving network-based problems.
