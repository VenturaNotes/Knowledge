- Example
	- Strong
		- "Billie's legs are noodles. The ends of her hair are poison needles. Her tongue is a bristly sponge, and her eyes are bags of bleach." - Kelly Link, Secret Identity
			- Billie's legs aren't actually noodles. They feel as limp as cooked noodles. An implied comparison. A metaphor.
		- "The world was ghost-quiet, except for the crack of sails and the burbling of water against the hull." - Tobias S. Buckell, Hurricane Fever.
			- Quiet, crack, and burbling engages sense of hearing (evokes a particular quality of sound)
			- "ghost-quiet"
				- Abstract connection. 
				- "Quiet as a ghost" would put a distancing layer of simile between the reader and the experience.
				- Author creates this metaphor
					- An implied rather than an overt comparison
		- "Love... began on a beach. It began that day when Jacob saw Anette in her stewed-cherry dress" - Tiphanie Yanique, Land of Love and Drowning
			- Brain engages in the absorbing task of figuring out what a stewed-cherry dress is like
			- Causes reader to experience the story in a visceral (relating to deep inward feelings rather than to the intellect) and conceptual level
			- Creates dynamic world of the senses
	- Poor
		- "Billie feels nauseated and week"
			- Description not that vivid
			- Matter of fact, non-tactile language is bad
			- Doesn't cause immersion
- Prose fiction
- When writing, use well-chosen words to engage sound, sight, taste, touch, smell, and movement. Then create unexpected connotations among story elements.
