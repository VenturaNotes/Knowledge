- Rhetoric
	- Art of effective speaking or writing
	- Carefully calibrated to situation in which the speaker and the audience interact with each other
- When analyzing text, start with rhetorical situation
- Known as rhetorical occasion or rhetorical context or rhetorical situation
	- Asking ourselves where the exchange between author and audience take place
	- When does it take place
	- private or out in public?
	- pleasant and open or hostile and closed?
	- in what ways is the author adjusting her message to this situation?
	- only by considering text in context can we really understand how the speaker and audience are interacting with each other

## Specifics
- Queen of England writing letter to cousin
	- Queen's intended audience is only one person (trusted relative)
	- Writes to cousin by saying she hopes she's well
		- She misses her and hopes they can get together one day soon
	- The rhetorical occasion here is a private letter between 2 relatives
	- For the most part, it's unremarkable
	- Keep in mind that the queen is a queen
		- So she probably isn't going to sign off with yolo
		- She is aware the letter can end up in a museum in 100 years
	- This rhetorical occasion has much lower stakes than her speeches to parliament or any other public speech she may give
- Queen and her cousin but change rhetorical situation
	- Occasion is now the 75th birthday of the queen's cousin
		- Queen is hosting her at Buckingham palace
		- Queen delivers toast to cousin on birthday
			- Very different occasion from private letter
		- Instead of audience of 1, it's an audience of dozens or hundreds of people
		- Instead of private written letter, situation is a public spoken speech
		- There is a certain expectation for how a toast should be.
			- It should be brief, personal and positive
			- Funny or playful
			- There are limits to what a queen can say
		- Everything a queen says and does is filtered through that situation. This is an occasion of a public toast on her cousin's birthday.
- On AP exam, need to do more than describe a rhetorical situation
	- Need to explain how the situation influences the author's rhetorical choices
	- Focusing on rhetorical occasion will help you best deliver information you want to convey. That is how you score points on essay graders
