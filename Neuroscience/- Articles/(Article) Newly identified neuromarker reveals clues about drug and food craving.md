	- A neuromarker is a neuroimaging biomarker [^1]
	- A neuromarker is a biomarker based on neuroscientific data, such as neuroimaging. Neuromarkers are biological indicators of the presence or progression of a disease or condition. They are generally statistical models that provide an objective estimate of how likely it is that a given condition is present. Neuromarkers can consist of a single variable, or be complex multivariate models. [^1]
