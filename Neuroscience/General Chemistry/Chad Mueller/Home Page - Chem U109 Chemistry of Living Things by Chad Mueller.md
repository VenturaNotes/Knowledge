## (1) Chemistry, Matter, and Measurement
### Chapter Overview
- “Chemistry is called the central science because a knowledge of chemical principles is essential for other sciences. Y” ([Mueller, p. 6](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=10&annotation=9HLBZ2II))
### (1.1) What is Chemistry
- “[[Chemistry]] is the study of matter—” ([Mueller, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=11&annotation=SSR7ZCSD))
	- What it consists, properties, and changes
- “[[Matter]] is anything that has mass and takes up space” ([Mueller, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=11&annotation=8WFZ9L35))
	- Air is matter
	- Book is matter
- “Chemistry is one branch of science.” ([Mueller, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=11&annotation=YDSHTP7G))
- “[[Science]] is the process by which we learn about the natural universe by observing, testing, and then generating models that explain our observations.” ([Mueller, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=11&annotation=UMEPWZL7))
- Some major branches of science
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-09-05 at 11.24.42 PM.png]]
		- Math
		- Physics
		- Chemistry
		- Biology
		- Biochemistry
		- Chemical Physics
		- Medicine
		- Geology
		- Geochemistry
		- Astronomy
- “Thus, [[chemistry]] is the study of matter, [[biology]] is the study of living things, and [[geology]] is the study of rocks and the earth. [[Mathematics]] is the language of science,” ([Mueller, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=11&annotation=PJKTPLJ6))

#### Looking Closer: Alchemy
- Chemistry developed in 1600s and 1700s that we consider valid today
	- Before, study of matter was known as [[alchemy]]. Practiced by China, Arabia, Egypt, and Europe
- Alchemy was a mystical/secretive approach to manipulate matter
	- Practitioners, called alchemists, “thought that all matter was composed of different proportions of the four basic elements—fire, water, earth, and air” ([Mueller, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=11&annotation=QIKSGSN8))
		- Changing proportions would change substance
- “attempts to “transmute” common metals into gold represented one goal of alchemy.” ([Mueller, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=11&annotation=9NA6F8IM))
	- “synthesize the [[philosopher’s stone]], a” ([Mueller, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=11&annotation=8CIFYXE6))
		- This would impart long life, perhaps immortality
- Alchemists used symbols to represent substances to maintain secrecy of alchemical knowledge. Below is the first [[affinity table]]
	-  ![[Screenshot 2023-09-05 at 11.29.51 PM.png|500]]
- Alchemy was a serious, scholarly endeavor. [[Isaac Newton]] was an alchemist

#### Example 1.1.1
- Astronomy is a branch of science because it is a study of some aspect of the natural universe. This is because it studies the stars and planets

#### Scientific Method
- Scientists use [[scientific method]]
	- Organized procedure for learning answers to questions
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-09-05 at 11.33.21 PM.png|500]]
		- Process
			- Propose a hypothesis
				- Testable idea
				- “For scientific applications, the word theory is a general statement that describes a large set of observations and data.” ([Mueller, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=13&annotation=V38BF8QQ))
					- [[Theory]] represents highest level of scientific understanding.
			- Test the Hypothesis
				- “scientist evaluates the hypothesis by devising and carrying out experiments to test it” ([Mueller, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=13&annotation=NGDQ8PLQ))
			- Refine the hypothesis
				- “Depending on the results of experiments, a scientist may want to modify the hypothesis and then test it again.” ([Mueller, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=13&annotation=CQLRRFST))

#### Terms used in describing nature of science
- [[Fact]]: “an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and for all practical purposes is accepted as "true." T” ([Mueller, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=13&annotation=ATF9ZFN4))
	- May potentially be discarded
	- Ex: Statement that takes up space has mass is considered a fact
- [[Hypothesis]]: “A tentative statement about the natural world leading to deductions that can be tested. If the” ([Mueller, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=13&annotation=F46UK8VC))
	- Verifying deductions increases probability that the hypothesis is correct
	- Incorrect deductions allows for the original hypothesis to be abandoned or modified
	- Ex: The hypothesis that everything is made of earth, air, fire, and water has been abandoned
- [[Law]]: “A descriptive generalization about how some aspect of the natural world behaves under stated circumstances.” ([Mueller, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=13&annotation=RYZ3GR86))
	- [[Law of Conservation of Matter]]
		- “matter is neither created nor destroyed, but only changes form.” ([Mueller, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=13&annotation=9HJ53C4N))
- [[Theory]]: “well-substantiated explanation of some aspect of the natural world that can incorporate facts, laws, inferences, and tested hypotheses.” ([Mueller, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=13&annotation=4LQ2RIXT))
	- “Theories do not turn into facts through the accumulation of evidence. Ra” ([Mueller, p. 9](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=13&annotation=8IPTADRN))
		- More based on extensive observation, experimentation, and creative reflection
	- Theories are the end points of science
	- Ex: Will learn about [[atomic theory]]
		- Not just a simple observation that we call a "fact" nor is it proven
		- “It has been supported by so much experimental evidence for such a long time, that it is generally accepted by the scientific community.)” (Mueller, p. 10)
#### Concept Review
- Steps of [[scientific method]]
	- “Propose a hypothesis, test the hypothesis, and refine the hypothesis if necessary.” ([Mueller, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=14&annotation=34D9TGPK))
- “The scientific method is the general process by which we learn about the natural universe.” ([Mueller, p. 10](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=14&annotation=XBK7G8KA))

### (1.2) The Classification of Matter
#### Physical and Chemical Properties
- Properties of Matter
	- [[Physical Property|physical properties]]: “characteristics that describe matter. They include characteristics such as size, shape, color, and mass. Che” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=4ASGVI6M))
	- [[Chemical Property|chemical properties]]:“characteristics that describe how matter changes its chemical structure or composition. An e” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=QZCDPNUT))
		- flammability: a material's ability to burn
			- Burning (known as [[Combustion|combustion]]) changes chemical composition of a material

#### Elements and Compounds
- “Any sample of matter that has the same physical and chemical properties throughout the sample is called a [[substance]].” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=JPF68WH6))
	- Two types
		- “A substance that cannot be broken down into chemically simpler components is an [[element]].” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=YBHUXBRJ))
			- Aluminum (used in soda cans)
			- 118 known elements in universe
		- “A substance that can be broken down into chemically simpler components (because it has more than one element) is a [[compound]]” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=5NBNJYGT))
			- Water composed of hydrogen and oxygen
			- tens of millions of different compounds identified to date
	- “Sometimes the word pure is added to substance, but this is not absolutely necessary. By definition, any single substance is pure.” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=CBRM57XG))
- “smallest part of an element that maintains the identity of that element is called an [[atom]].” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=CT2PNHVH))
	- Extremely tiny
- “lest part of a [[compound]] that maintains the identity of that compound is called a [[molecule]].” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=3JLUFI9F))
	- “[[Molecules]] are composed of atoms that are attached together and behave as a unit.” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=2KLS8S3E))
- [[Macroscopic viewpoint]]: Scientists working with large numbers of atoms or molecules at a time
- [[Microscopic viewpoint]]: “Describe chemical events on the level of individual atoms or molecules,” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=4IXN3DQ4))
- “[[matter]] is composed of microscopic [[particle|particles]] so tiny that billions of them are needed to make a speck we can see with the naked eye. The” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=SRJEWJKM))

#### Mixtures
- “A material composed of two or more substances is a [[mixture]].” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=3EYX3I5P))
	- “Individual substances maintain their chemical identities.” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=49TVAITI))
		- “Many mixtures are obvious combinations of two or more substances” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=QA9D54XF))
			- [[Heterogeneous mixture]]
				- Sand and water
		- “Mixtures with a consistent composition throughout are called [[Homogeneous Mixture|homogeneous mixtures]] (or solutions).” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=XUQMR5KP))
			- Sugar dissolved in water
			- [[Metal alloy]] like [[steel]] is a [[solid solution]]
			- “[[air]], a mixture of mainly [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]], is a [[gaseous solution]].” ([Mueller, p. 11](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=15&annotation=6T5SUY7D))

#### Example 1.2.1
- Sea water: homogeneous mixture
- Soil: heterogeneous mixture
- Water: Compound
- Oxygen: Element

#### Phases
- “Another way to classify matter is to describe it as a [[solid]], a [[liquid]], or a [[gas]]  ([Mueller, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=16&annotation=NBWP46Y5))
	- Implies matter has certain physical properties (3 phases of matter)
	- “[[solid]] has a definite shape and a definite volume.” ([Mueller, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=16&annotation=4TWGUYB3))
	- “[[Liquids]] ordinarily have a definite volume but not a definite shape; they take the shape of their containers.” ([Mueller, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=16&annotation=5VH7UZF5))
	- “[[Gases]] have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume, and they expand to fill their containers.” ([Mueller, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=16&annotation=IUHPPX2A))
- Water examples
	- “ice (solid), water (liquid), and steam (gas).” ([Mueller, p. 12](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=16&annotation=GBMXYGLT))
- Phase changes caused by varying [[temperature]] of substance (and less commonly, [[pressure]] exerted on it)
	- [[Phase change]] is a physical process
- Phase Changes

| Change          | Name            |
| --------------- | --------------- |
| solid to liquid | [[melting]], [[fusion]] |
| solid to gas    | [[sublimation]]     |
| liquid to gas   |     [[boiling]], [[evaporation]]            |
| liquid to solid |       [[solidification]], [[freezing]]          |
| gas to liquid   |        [[condensation]]         |
| gas to solid                |       [[deposition]]          |

#### Exercises
- [[Physical Property|physical properties]] describe the existence of matter. [[Chemical Property|Chemical properties]] describe how substances change into other substances
- Matter has physical properties and chemical properties
- Matter can be identified as an element, compound or mixture.
### (1.3) Measurements
#### Introduction
- “Chemists measure the properties of matter and express these measurements as quantities. A [[quantity]] is an amount of something and consists of a number and a unit.” ([Mueller, p. 14](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=18&annotation=WWJ45PFR))

#### Example 1.3.1
- One dozen eggs
	- Number: 1
	- Unit: dozen eggs
- 2.54 centimeters
	- Number: 2.54
	- Unit: centimeters
- A box of pencils
	- Number: 1
	- Unit: box of pencils
- 88 meters per second
	- Number: 88
	- Unit: meters per second

#### Concept Review
- Two necessary parts of a quantity are the number and unit
### (1.4) Expressing Numbers - Scientific Notation
#### Introduction
- “you may have 5,000,000,000,000 red blood cells in a liter of blood, and the diameter of an iron atom is 0.000000014 inches.” ([Mueller, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=20&annotation=ZIXG5QKU))
- “[[Scientific notation]] is a system for expressing very large or very small numbers in a compact manner. It us” ([Mueller, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=20&annotation=4JNFU6JG))
- “The convention for expressing numbers in scientific notation is to write a single nonzero first digit, a decimal point, and the rest of the digits, excluding any trailing zeros. T” ([Mueller, p. 16](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=20&annotation=JLTAHNB8))

##### Examples
- $67,000,000,000$ = $6.7 \times 10^{10}$
- $1,689 = 1.689 \times 10^3$
- $12.6 = 1.26 \times 10^{1}$

#### Scientific Notation with Magnitudes less than 1
- “In scientific notation, numbers with a magnitude greater than one have a positive power, while numbers with a magnitude less than one have a negative power.” ([Mueller, p. 17](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=21&annotation=TSGMG846))

##### Examples
- $0.000006567$ = $6.567 \times 10^{-6}$
- $-0.0004004$ = $-4.004 \times 10^{-4}$
	- Negative numbers do not affect rules on scientific notation
- 100.5 ^zd4osa
	- This is [[standard notation]] / nonscientific notation

#### Concept Review
- Scientific notation more convenient than listing large number of zeros
	- Power of 10 is positive if decimal point moves left and negative if decimal point moves right (different when unwinding)
- Large or small numbers uses scientific notation which is expressed with powers of 10
### (1.5) Expressing numbers - Significant Figures
#### Introduction
- “The significant figures of a measured quantity are defined as all the digits known with certainty and the first uncertain, or estimated, digit. It” ([Mueller, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=23&annotation=8H29TINY))
- “Zeros are used when needed to place the significant figures in their correct positions. Thus, zeros may not be [[significant figures]].” ([Mueller, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=23&annotation=YUJY29RN))
	- "s f" may be written on assignment for reminder about sig figs

#### Significant Figures Rules
- (1) “All nonzero digits are significant. In 1,357, all the digits are significant.” ([Mueller, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=23&annotation=T7TSX4IG))
- (2) [[Captive zeros]]: "zeros between significant digits, are significant. In 405, all the digits are significant.” ([Mueller, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=23&annotation=A7LVXLDN))
- (3) “[[Leading zeros]], which are zeros at the beginning of a decimal number less than 1, are not significant” ([Mueller, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=23&annotation=N6Y7C4TL))
	- In 0.000458, there are 3 sig figs
- (4) “[[Trailing zeros]], which are zeros at the end of a number, are significant only if the number has a decimal point.” ([Mueller, p. 19](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=23&annotation=HRZUZVQR))
	- 1500
		- 2 sig figs
	- 1,500.00
		- 6 sig figs

#### Example 1.5.1
- 6,798,000
	- 4 sig figs
- 6,000,798
	- 7 sig figs
- 6,000,798.00
	- 9 sig figs
- 0.0006798
	- 4 sig figs

#### Combining Numbers
- Addition or subtraction rule: limit the answer's significant figures to the rightmost column for which all the numbers have significant figures.
	- For 56.789, 102.2, and 1,300.099, the final answer would be limited to the tenths place
		- When adding, we'd get 1,459.1 (needed to round the tenths place up due to the hundredths place)
			- “If the first dropped digit is 5 or higher, round up. If the first dropped digit is lower than 5, do not round up.” ([Mueller, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=24&annotation=XBFBYMEB))
- For multiplication or division, the term with the lowest number of significant figures will be the number of significant figures in the answer
	- Example
		- $38.65 \times 105.93 = 4,094.1945$
			- With 4 sig figs being the lowest count, solution is $4,094$ 
- “In scientific notation, all significant figures are listed explicitly.” ([Mueller, p. 20](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=24&annotation=R74VT9LA))
	- Since 450.0 has 4 sig figs, in scientific notation it would be $4.500 \times 10^2$

#### Example 1.5.2
- [Practice](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=24&annotation=4FXPAAI3)
	- (a) 2085.6
	- (b) 1130
	- (c) For 1,027 + 610 + 363.06 = 2000.06
		- In standard notation, sig figs end in the tens place due to "610", so we will be able to get 200<u>0.06</u>
			- “the underlined one's, tenth's, and hundredth's places are not significant” ([Mueller, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=25&annotation=C4TXJ5YL))
		- In scientific notation, it would be $2.00 \times 10^3$ 
			- Seems like scientific notation makes showing sig figs easier
	- (d) For $14.84 \times 0.55 - 8.02$ ^4kt0bj
		- $14.84 \times 0.55 =$ 8.1<u>62</u> (Has two sig figs)
		- 8.1<u>62</u> - 8.02 = 0.1<u>42</u> = 0.1
			- Since sig figs are limited to the tenths place in this example, the final answer is 0.1

##### Note on Rounding
- “It is most accurate to round your answer at the very end (while still keeping track of the significant figures at each step), like done by underlining the digits that are not significant in Part d above.” ([Mueller, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=25&annotation=CGRCTMCT))
	- It's less accurate but still acceptable to round at each step if it helps to keep track of significant figures
		- New answer for (d) would be 0.2 $\approx$
			- “The "≈" symbol means "approximately equal to" and is used here when rounding early.” ([Mueller, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=25&annotation=NP94T9FG))

#### Concept Review
- “Significant figures represent all the known digits of a measurement plus the first estimated one.” ([Mueller, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=25&annotation=II884PJT))
- “Significant figures properly report the number of measured and estimated digits in a measurement.” ([Mueller, p. 21](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=25&annotation=SQCGP737))
### (1.6) The International System of Units
#### Introduction
- For measurements, branches of science use “[[International System of Units]] (also known as SI after Système Internationale d’Unités),” ([Mueller, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=26&annotation=NMTFFF5R))
#### Base SI Units
- “[[Base units]] or basic units, are the fundamental units of SI.” ([Mueller, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=26&annotation=BRUVKYI2))
	- “There are seven base units, which are listed in Table , Chemistry uses five of the base units: the mole for amount, the kilogram for mass, the meter for length, the second for time, and the kelvin for temperature.” ([Mueller, p. 22](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=26&annotation=PMQVXWCV))
- Relationship between [[kelvin|kelvins]] and degrees [[Celsius]]
	- $K = \degree C + 273.15$
- Seven Base SI Units ^d2qes2

| Property               | Unit         | Abbreviation |
| :--------------------- | ------------ | ------------ |

#### Difference between mass and weight?
- “The [[mass]] of a body is a measure of its inertial property or how much matter it contains.” ([Mueller, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=27&annotation=YKFWRGDA))
- “The [[weight]] of a body is a measure of the force exerted on it by gravity or the force needed to support it.” ([Mueller, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=27&annotation=L88TADD6))
	- “[[Gravity]] on earth gives a body a downward acceleration of about 9.8 m/s .” ([Mueller, p. 23](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=27&annotation=AA4RT6DI))
- “The SI unit of mass is the kilogram (kg)” ([Mueller, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=28&annotation=AVJ8HX3M))
- “[[weight]] of a body in a particular reference frame is defined as the force that gives the body an acceleration equal to the local acceleration of free fall in that reference frame.” ([Mueller, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=28&annotation=JW66RU8D))
	- “the SI unit of the quantity [[weight]] defined in this way ([[force]]) is the [[newton]] (N).” ([Mueller, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=28&annotation=4SJNCGUZ))
#### Derived SI Units
- “[[Derived unit|Derived units]] are combinations of SI base units. Un” ([Mueller, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=28&annotation=XPSKY6YY))
- 2cm $\times$ 2cm = 4cm^2 (read as four centimeters squared or "four square centimeters")
- “[[Volume]] is the amount of space that a given substance occupies and is defined geometrically as length × width × height.” ([Mueller, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=28&annotation=9VL9DGE2))
	- Meters cubed or cubic meters
	- Volumes typically expressed in $\frac {1}{1000}$ of a cubic meter (known as the [[liter]] (L))
- “liter is a little larger than 1 [[US quart]] in volume” ([Mueller, p. 24](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=28&annotation=63KKX4S9))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 8.56.33 AM.png]]
	- Approximate equivalents to some SI Units
		- meters to inches to feet to yards
		- centimeters to miles
		- kilograms to pounds
		- pound to grams
		- liters to us quarts
		- quarts to liters
- ![[Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 8.58.26 AM.png]]
	- 1 milliliter = 1 cubic centimeter
- Example 1.6.1
	- kiloliter: kL 
		- ($10^3$)
	- microsecond: $\micro$s
		- $10^{-6}$
	- decimeter: $dm$ 
		- $10^{-1}$
	- nanogram: $ng$ 
		- $10^{-9}$
- “[[Energy]], another important quantity in chemistry, is the ability to perform work, such as moving a box of books from one side of a room to the other side. I” ([Mueller, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=29&annotation=SAWSZP5U))
	- Has [[derived unit]] of $kg*m^2/s^2$
		- Collection of units redefined as [[joule]] (J)
		- “Older unit of energy, the [[calorie]] (cal), is also widely used.” ([Mueller, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=29&annotation=6DD68CE3))
			- 4.184 J in 1 cal
				- “All [[chemical processes]] occur with a simultaneous change in energy.” ([Mueller, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=29&annotation=UMD877KT))
- To Your Health: Energy and Food
	- “food industry prefers to use the kilocalorie and refers to it as the [[Calorie (food)|Calorie]] (with a capital C).” ([Mueller, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=29&annotation=HU5359TX))
		- average daily energy requirement of an adult is 2,000 - 2,500 Calories (2 million to 2.5 million calories)
	- “ingest more Calories from food than we expend, however, our bodies store the extra energy in high-energy-density compounds, such as fat, and we gain weight.” ([Mueller, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=29&annotation=N5AZ53UH))
	- “If we expend more energy than we ingest, we lose weight. Ot” ([Mueller, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=29&annotation=VDF22FDY))
	- Factors that affect weight
		- “genetic, metabolic, behavioral, environmental, cultural factors” ([Mueller, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=29&annotation=ZDM5HUUG))
		- Dietary habits among most important
	- “In 2008 the [[US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] issued a report stating that 73% of Americans were either overweight or obese.” ([Mueller, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=29&annotation=IM2ZR6N2))
		- 19% children (6-11) and 18% adolescents (12-19) were overweight
			- Numbers that had tripled over preceding two decades
		- Main cause is excessive calorie consumption (high-fat foods) and reduced physical activity
- “[[Density]] is defined as the mass of an object divided by its volume; it describes the amount of matter contained in a given amount of space.” ([Mueller, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=29&annotation=YUMAS223))
	- $\text{density} = \frac{\text{mass}}{\text{volume}}$
		- $g/cm^3$ or $g/mL$ (for [[solids]] and [[liquids]])
		- $g/L$ (for [[gases]])
		- $kg/m^3$
		- and so forth
- Density of [[water]]: $1.00 g/cm^3$
- Density of [[mercury]]: 13.6 g/mL
- “Mercury is over 13 times as dense as water, meaning that it contains over 13 times the amount of matter in the same amount of space.” ([Mueller, p. 25](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=29&annotation=NMD9AGXT))
- Density of [[air]] room temperature: 1.3 g/L
#### Example 1.6.2: Density of Bone
- Mass is $27.8g$ and volume is $25.3cm^3$
	- $\frac {27.8g}{25.3cm^3}$ = $1.10 g/cm^3$

#### Concept Review
- Units follow same mathematical rules as numbers
	- $mL \times \frac {g}{mL} = g$
- “[[Base units]] are the seven fundamental units of SI; [[Derived unit|derived units]] are constructed by making combinations of the base units; b” ([Mueller, p. 26](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=30&annotation=9D4I2IT3))
	- Base units: kilograms, meters
	- Derived Units: grams per milliliter, joules
- Combining prefixes with base units creates new units of larger or smaller sizes
### (1.7) Converting Units
#### Conversion factors
- “A fraction that has equivalent quantities in the numerator and the denominator but expressed in different units is called a [[conversion factor]].” ([Mueller, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=31&annotation=U65XB4TP))
- “every conversion factor will have two forms, both equal to one, but reciprocated (flipped).” ([Mueller, p. 27](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=31&annotation=CR2EU3TI))
- Conversion factors for 1 kg = 2.20lbs
	- $\frac {1kg}{2.20lbs} \text{ or } \frac{2.20lbs}{1kg}$
- “For the answer to be meaningful, we have to construct the conversion factor in a form that causes the original unit to cancel out.” ([Mueller, p. 28](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=32&annotation=HBLKKE4G))
	- To find out how much 55 lb is in kg. 
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 9.35.29 AM.png]]
			- quantity (in old units) $\times$ conversion factor = quantity (in new units)

#### Conversion Factors with Prefix Multipliers (Exponents)
- Prefixes can be made into two different reciprocal conversion factors
	- $\frac {1cm}{10^{-2}m} \text{ or }\frac{10^{-2}m}{1 cm}$
- Best to use exponents with conversions but using standard notation is ok as well
	- ![[Screenshot 2023-09-14 at 9.41.29 AM.png]]
- May use prefixes such as giga or micro if you have trouble with exponential notation

#### Significant Figures in Conversions
- “Numbers in conversion factors based on prefix changes, such as kilograms to grams, are not considered in the determination of significant figures in a calculation because the numbers in such conversion factors are exact.” ([Mueller, p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=33&annotation=H28UPG8J))
	- “[[Exact numbers]] are defined or counted numbers, not [[measured numbers]], and can be considered as having an infinite number of significant figures. (In” ([Mueller, p. 29](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=33&annotation=SZJXIQUP))
		- 1kg = 1000g exactly
	- [[Counted numbers]] are exact
		- If 16 students in classroom, the number 16 is exact
- Conversions not involving a prefix change (such as between different systems of units), typically are not exact
	- When given 1kg = 2.20 lbs, assume 3 sig figs (but can assume 6 sigs when 1kg = 2.20462 lbs)
- Conversion factors from measurements or approximations should be considered when determining sig figs

##### Example 1.7.1
- When converting 4.7L to milliliters, we know it's 4,7000 mL. Since the conversion is exact, we don't consider determining the number of sig figs in final answer. Therefore, 2 sig figs in final answer
- Converting 18 ms to seconds is 0.018. The conversion does not affect number of sig figs in final answer

##### Example 1.7.2
- 101,000 ns to seconds $\to$ 0.000101s
- 32.08kg to grams $\to$ 32080g
	- To more clearly show sig figs, use scientific notation $3.208 \times 10^4$ 

###### Conversion factors between units
- “[[density]] can be used to convert between the [[mass]] and the [[volume]] of a substance.” ([Mueller, p. 30](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=34&annotation=EF6G7DYK))
- “Consider [[mercury]], which is a [[liquid]] at room temperature and has a [[density]] of 13.6 g/mL.” ([Mueller, p. 30](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=34&annotation=7NNPFFQR))
	- This says that 13.6 grams of mercury has a volume of 1mL
- When doing $16 \times \frac{13.6}{1mL}$ = 217.6g = 220g
	- We keep just 2 sig figs since the conversion factor is exact

##### Example 1.7.3: Mercury Thermometer
- To find volume of 0.750g of mercury, we can use a conversion factor or rearrange the density formula

###### Looking Closer - Density and the Body
- “The [[density|densities]] of many components and products of the body have a bearing on our [[health]].” ([Mueller, p. 31](zotero://select/library/items/CF6XQDVJ)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/X29KZPQK?page=35&annotation=5RGR5YLC))
- [[Bones]]
	- If [[bone tissue]] is lower-than-normal density, it's mechanically weaker and susceptible to breaking
	- Density of bone is related to amount of [[calcium]] in one's diet
		- People with a deficiency in calcium will have weaker bones
			- Dietary supplements or dairy products may help strengthen the bones
	- [[Women]] experience a decrease in bone density as they age. Half of women over 50 suffer from excessive bone loss (condition known as [[osteoporosis]])
		- A healthy 30-year-old female as a bone density of $0.95-1.05 g/cm^3$
		- Osteoporosis is diagnosed if bone density is below $0.6-0.7 g/cm^3$
- [[Urine]]
	- Sufferers of [[diabetes]] produce a large volume of urine with relatively low density
	- In [[diabetes mellitus]], there is excess [[glucose]] dissolved in the urine causing density of urine to be abnormally high
	- Density of urine may be high because of excess [[protein]] in urine (due to [[congestive heart failure]] or [[renal]] ([[kidney]]) problems
	- Urine density test can provide clues to various kinds of health problems
	- Density of urine commonly expressed as a [[specific gravity]], [[unitless]] quantity defined
		- $\frac{\text{density of some material}}{\text{density of water}}$
			- Normal values for the specific gravity of urine range from 1.002 to 1.028
- [[Body fat]]
	- Overall density of the body is an indicator of a person's total body fat
	- [[Fat]] is less dense than [[muscle]] and other [[tissues]]
		- As fat accumulates, overall density of body decreases
	- Measurement of person's weight and volume provides the overall body density which correlates to percentage of body fat
		- Body's volume found by immersion in a large tank of water. Amount of water displaced equals volume of body
#### Multiple Conversions
- Do a stepwise conversion between 54.7km into millimeters. Convert to base unit first and then new unit.
	- Single multi-step expression possible
