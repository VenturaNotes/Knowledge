	- Units and Conversions
	- Metric system and SI units ("Système International d'Unités")
	- SI units
		- Length (m)
			- Meter
		- Mass (kg)
			- kilogram (but will be using gram (g) more in chemistry)
		- Time (s)
			- Seconds
		- Temperature (k)
			- Kelvin scale (or absolute scale since it has a true 0)
			- No such thing as negative temperature on the kelvin scale
			- When you get to 0, that is the complete absence of heating
		- Volume ($m^3$)
			- meters cubed (derived by length)
			- Will use liter (L) more in chemistry
			- There are 1000 liters in 1 meter cubed.
				- With PV = nRT (gas law), it's always in liters.
		- Energy/Work (J)
			- Joules
			- Usually kilowatt hour when checking heating bill
		- Pressure (Pa)
			- Pascal
			- Will use atmosphere (atm) more commonly
				- millimeters of mercury or tor
			- There are roughly 100,000 pascals is equal to 1 atmosphere
				- Technically 101,325
		- There is an SI unit for luminosity (how bright light is (called "Candela" with syblo of "cd"))
			- Pretty much will never use in class
	- Metric System (below are the prefixes)
		- Terra = $10^{12}$
		- Giga = $10^9$
		- Mega = $10^6$
		- Kilo = $10^3$
		- Centi = $10^{-2}$
		- Milli = $10^{-3}$
		- Micro = $10^{-6}$
		- Nano = $10^{-9}$
		- Pico = $10^{-12}$
		- Femto = $10^{-15}$
		- Atto = $10^{-18}$
	- Lovely powers of 10 applies to both SI units and the metric system

	- A conversion factor is just an equality between different units
	- Setting up the units first is the process of dimensional analysis
	- 1in = 2.54cm
		- Need to cross over American system to metric system
	- 1ft = 12in
	- 5280ft = 1 mile
	- 3ft = 1yd
	- 1e-2 = 0.01 or $1 \times 10^{-2}$
	- If all conversion factors have an infinite number of sig figs, we'd need to get the sig fig from the first term.
		- Never use sig figs from conversion factors
	- Pay attention to if the units are squared. If you have $m^3$, you must cube $m$ when doing dimensional analysis

	- Conversions with Temperature ([[Kelvin]], Celsius, Fahrenheit)
	- [[Freezing point]] of water
		- $0\degree C$ or $32 \degree F$
	- [[Boiling point]] of water
		- $100\degree C$ or $212 \degree F$
	- [[Celsius]] and [[Fahrenheit]] temperature in common
		- $-40\degree C$ = $-40 \degree F$
	- Could derive Fahrenheit and Celsius given the points above (finding the slope)

	- [[Density]] is an [[(1) 1.1 Matter - General Chemistry#^055c83|intensive property]]
		- Can use it to spot real gold vs fake gold
		- Can use density to find what certain substances are
	- $\rho$ is the proper variable used for [[density]]
		- Will use it ubiquitously in a physics class
		- Is "lowercase rho"
	- Density, mass, and volume
	- A cube with 2.00cm edges weighs 12.0g. What is its density?
	- We would have the same density if the cube was larger because density is an intensive property
