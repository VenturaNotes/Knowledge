## What is matter?
- Matter is anything that has mass and occupies space
	- It has mass and volume
- Matter is made of tiny particles called atoms
- Different types of atoms (118)
	- We call the different types elements
- Everything in universe is made up of these atoms of 118 different types

## 3 Major Phases/States of Matter
- Solid
	- Definite shape
	- Definite volume
	- Most solids are crystalline solids.
		- Atoms arranged in a nice repeating pattern (called a crystal structure.)
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-28 at 7.47.35 AM.png]]
			- These points don't need to be individual atoms, but they can be molecules too
				- Molecules are combinations of atoms
			- Amorphous solids
				- It's actually random where the atoms are in terms of structure
			- Most solids are crystalline, and atoms are not moving to any significant extent
- Liquid
	- No definite shape
		- takes shape of container
	- Definite volume
	- Liquids are a little more random, atoms are "flowing"
		- Not in crystalline structure and not restricted in motion. Will be able to move around compared to a solid
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-28 at 7.51.50 AM.png]]
- Gas
	- takes shape of container and expands in it
	- No Definite Shape
	- No Definite Volume
	- Atoms are spread out and moving
	- Moving typically faster than corresponding atoms/molecules than the liquid are moving.

- There is a 4th phase called plasma but won't talk about it.

## Elements vs Compounds
- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-28 at 8.08.18 AM.png]]
- Helps with properties and classifications of matter
- We have a periodic table of elements
	- All elements have a chemical symbol. Sodium is Na and carbon is a C
	- The elements represent the fundamental types of atoms that exist
- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A substance made up of 1 type of atom is called an element.</mark>
	- Na (sodium) metal
		- It's a solid at room temperature
		- Every atom in that metal is going to be sodium (small chance of impurities)
		- Another use of element is when the element itself is a standalone substance
		- Here you have the element sodium itself
- A compound is a substance made of multiple elements
	- NaCl (sodium chloride) also known as salt
		- Known as a compound because it has 2 different types of atoms present in a 1:1 ratio
		- There are sodium atoms and there are chlorine atoms
			- Not just made up of 1 type of atom. It's made up of 2 types of atoms
		- We've used "element" as one of the components of a compound
		- Element sodium is in a compound
- As long as you're an element or a compound (and not the gaseous state), you'll have a lot of atoms bonded to each other.
	- In pure sodium metal, all the sodiums are in a big chunk in the solid phase and in some measure bonded to each other
	- In sodium chloride, you get a repeating crystal. You have all the atoms bonded to each other, but 2 types of atoms present in a 1:1 ratio
	- Both can be used to describe a single substance
- Not all elements on periodic table in their elemental form come 1:1:1. In fact, 
	- $N_2, O_2, F_2, Cl_2, Br_2, I_2, H_2$ 
		- They all come 2:2:2 in their standalone form
		- Referred to as the diatomics (2 atoms)
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">There are 7 of them and you need to memorize them</mark>
		- 6 of the 7  form the shape of the # 7 on the periodic table
			- Nitrogen, Oxygen, Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, Iodine, Hydrogen
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-28 at 8.05.00 AM.png]]
			- Mnemonic
				- Never ($N_2$)
				- Have ($H_2$)
				- Fear ($F_2$)
				- Of ($O_2$)
				- Ice ($I_2$)
				- Cold ($Cl_2$) (elemental chlorine)
				- Beer ($Br_2$)
			- In their elemental form, they come by 2:2:2
				- However, if they're part of a compound, they don't have to come 2 at a time such as NaCl (non-elemental chlorine). One component of a compound
## Pure Substance vs Mixture
- What happens if you have more than 1 substance present?
- Pure substance
	- 1 substance (1 element or 1 compound)
	- Pure Element $O_2$ 
	- Pure Compound ($H_2O$ )
		- Single compound / substance
		- Hydrogen and oxygen atoms <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">bonded</mark> to each other
- Mixture
	- Combination of multiple substances
	- Air ($N_2$ + $O_2$ )
		- Has different components "together" in mixture
		- But <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">not bonded</mark> together
		- Also made of carbon dioxide and argon.
	- More than 1 element that are separate substances but mixed together
	- Salt water ($NaCl/H_2O$ )
		- Not bonded but present together
		- 2 compounds here so mixture

## Types of mixtures
- Homogeneous Mixture
	- Homo means same
	- Composition of mixture
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A mixture with uniform composition throughout</mark>
		- If you took a little sample from different parts of the mixture, you'll have exactly the same amount of every component
		- Composition would be the same so uniform
	- Another word is "solution" for homogeneous mixture as well
		- Can have liquid, solid, and gas solutions
		- As long as components spread uniformly (uniform composition), it will be a homogeneous mixture
	- Examples
		- Air (set percentage of nitrogen (78%) Oxygen (21%), as well as $CO_2$ )
		- Salt Water
			- Depends on situation
			- Taking a pinch of salt and it dissolves in water (all of it), it will spread out uniformly throughout the entire solution
				- Salt is only going to be so what we call "soluble" in water
		- Milk
			- Typically, milk is homogenized meaning that it is a homogeneous mixture. Should be typically homogeneous
			- If leaving milk out on counter, it may curdle (so it could be a heterogeneous mixture)
- Heterogeneous Mixtures
	- Hetero means different
	- Mixture not have a uniform composition
		- Doesn't have the same composition throughout
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">A mixture lacking uniform composition</mark>
	- Examples
		- Salad
			- Has different components
			- If you take a bite of a salad, might get tomatoes or cucumber
				- Will get a different set of components in every bite
		- Supreme Pizza
			- Might get sausage or olives
		- Salt Water
			- Depends on situation
			- Putting too much salt in, it will not dissolve.
				- The rest will sink to bottom and sit on bottom of glass
			- Then you have a ton of salt sitting on the bottom, and you will have lesser amounts dissolved in solution. Taking sample at bottom or top, will get a different concentration of salt (composition of mixture)

## Chemical vs Physical Changes & Properties
- Chemical Property / Change
	- If there is a change, will be called chemical change
	- If change converts one substance to a different substance, it's referred to as chemical change
	- Examples
		- Lighting study guide paper on fire
			- $C_6H_{12}O_6 \rightarrow CO_2 + H_2O$ 
				- Turns 1 substance into different substances
				- Burning it would be a chemical change instead of physical change
				- Combustion (burning) is a chemical change
					- Property is flammability
		- Nail rusting
			- Nail made of iron (Fe) and as it rusts, it combines with Oxygen to form a new compound Iron oxide
				- $Fe + O_2 \rightarrow Fe_2O_3$ 
				- Will worry about balancing them later on in chapter 3
				- Started off with 2 different elemental substances and made a compound
				- When nail rusting, undergoes oxidation
					- property is oxidizability
						- Chemical change will have chemical property associated with it.
- Physical Property / Change
	- If there is a change, will be called physical change
	- If change does not convert substance to a different substance, then it's just a physical change
	- Example
		- If ripped paper (cellulose), it will be a physical change since substance didn't change
			-  $C_6H_{12}O_6$ ->  $C_6H_{12}O_6$ 
				- This is glucose
				- You just have 2 pieces of it now instead of 1 bigger piece
		- Phase changes
			- Liquid -> Solid is freezing
			- Solid -> Liquid is melting
				- Melting ice 
				- $H_2O(s) \rightarrow H_2O(l)$ 
					- We often will take particular phase of matter and write it in parenthesis right after the formula for a substance to identify what phase it's in. 
					- Exact same substance (compound in this case), both before and after we melted it
					- Didn't convert 1 substance into a different substance
					- Property associated with change is called
						- Melting Point
						- In the case of water, there is a characteristic temperature at which a substance is going to melt. For water, it's 0$\degree$C or $32\degree F$. Will use Celsius more in class 
						- Different substances melt at different temperatures
							- But it is a characteristic physical property of a substance is its melting point
								- Boiling point is another example
			- Not converting one substance into a different substance
		- Dissolving salt in water
			- $NaCl(s) \rightarrow NaCl(aq)$ 
				- aqueous means that something is dissolved in water
				- It's still NaCl, didn't convert it into a different substance. Not a chemical change but a physical change

## Intensive Properties vs Extensive Properties
- Does the size of the sample matter?
- Intensive Property ^055c83
	- Size of sample will not affect it
	- Examples
		- Melting point
			- Exact same temperature regardless of the size of water sample you have
			- (Phase change points in general are good examples of intensive properties)
		- Density = $\frac mv$ = mass / volume
			- Get an intensive property by dividing them
			- The density of water at room temperature is about 1g/ml.
				- Doesn't matter if you have glass of water or swimming pool of water. Density is still 1g/ml. Not affected by size of sample.
		- Temperature
			- If acclimated to outside temperature, they'll have the same temperature (glass of water vs swimming pool of water)
- Extensive Property
	- Size of sample will affect it
	- Examples
		- Mass
			- Size of sample will affect mass of substance (such as mass of glass of water vs mass of swimming pool of water)
		- Volume
			- Volume of glass of water is smaller than entire swimming pool filled with water
			- Size of sample will affect volume of sample
