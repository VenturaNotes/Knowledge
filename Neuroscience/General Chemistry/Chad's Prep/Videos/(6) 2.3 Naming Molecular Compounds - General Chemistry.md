## Summary
- Website [^1]
- For molecular compounds, no worrying about oxidation states and roman numerals
	- Simply a numerical prefix added before the name of each element to indicate how many atoms of that element are in a molecule

- Practice
	- $CO_2$ = Carbon dioxide
	- $P_2O_5$ = Diphosphorus pentoxide
	- $CCl_4$ = Carbon tetrachloride
	- oxygen difluoride = $OF_2$
	- carbon disulfide = $CS_2$
	- phosphorus pentachloride ($PCL_5$)

	- Naming molecular compounds
		- [[Binary molecular compound|binary molecular compounds]]
			- Only 2 elements in these molecular compounds
			- non-metal with non-metal
				- [[metalloids]] typically grouped in this system of nomenclature
			- [[Hydrogen]] is also a non-metal
	- Naming [[Molecular compound|molecular compounds]] (typically easier than ionic compounds)
		- (1) Give the numerical prefix of the first element (omit if only one--mono)
		- (2) Name the first element
		- (3) Give the numerical prefix for the second element
		- (4) Name the second element with the -ide suffix
	- [[Numerical prefixes]]
		- mono (1)
		- di (2)
		- tri (3)
		- tetra (4)
			- Can help by thinking of Tetris (4 boxes)
		- penta (5)
		- hexa (6)
		- hepta (7)
		- octa (8)
		- nona (9)
		- deca (10)
		- Instead of saying `tetraoxide`, better to say tetroxide
	- Different rules between naming ionic compounds and molecular compounds
		- $N_2O_4$
			- Dinitrogen tetroxide
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">If you only have 1 of the first element, leave off the mono. If you only have 1 of the second element, include the mono. </mark>The real rule states that when it's not clear, you must include the mono prefix. Clear means that when combining two different combinations, in both cases $CO_2$ and $CO$ has only 1 oxygen in both molecular compounds. Since `monocarbon` would be default in both cases, you just say carbon. Since oxygen is different in both cases, you need to specify monoxide
		- [[Hydrogen sulfide]] another example ($H_2S$)
