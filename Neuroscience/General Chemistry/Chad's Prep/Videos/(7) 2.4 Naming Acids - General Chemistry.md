## Summary
- Website [^1]
	- Errata
		- Says that $ClO_2^{-}$ is `perchlorite` in the oxoanion table when it should be just chlorite
- Naming [[Binary acid|binary acids]] ^47a5ef
	- Binary acid generally contains hydrogen and one other element
		- $HCl$
		- $H_2S$
		- Exception
			- $HCN$
	- Pattern: hydro-`element`-ic acid
		- Only variation is root of particular element
	- Names of common binary acids
		- $HCl$: hydrochloric acid
		- $H_2S$: hydrosulfuric acid
		- $Hl$: hydroiodic acid
- Naming [[Oxyacid|oxoacids]]: acids of polyatomic [[oxyanion|oxoanions]]
	- $H_2SO_4$ is the oxoacid of the sulfate ion, $SO_4^{2-}$
	- $H_2SO_3$ is the oxoacid of the sulfite ion $SO_3^{2-}$
	- $HNO_3$ is the oxoacid of the nitrate ion $NO_3^{-}$
	- $HNO_2$ is the oxoacid of the nitrite ion, $NO_2^{-}$
- To name the corresponding oxoacid, replace the -ic suffix with -ate or the -ite suffix with -ous + acid
	- $H_2SO_4$: sulfuric acid
	- $H_2SO_3$: sulfurous acid
	- $HNO_3$: Nitric acid
	- $HNO_2$: Nitrous acid
- Naming acids Practice
	- HBr: hydrobromic acid
	- $H_2S$: hydrosulfuric acid
	- hydroselenic acid: $H_2Se$ 
		- It's $H_2$ because selenium needs 2 electrons to be like a noble gas
	- hydrofluoric acid: $HF$ 
	- $H_3PO_4$: phosphoric acid
	- $HBrO_2$: bromous acid
	- carbonic acid: $H_2CO_3$
	- hypoiodous acid: $HIO$ 
		- $HOI$ is valid as well

	- 4 different sets of rules for naming compounds
	- [[Acids]]
		- [[Binary acid|binary acids]]
			- Typically made of 2 elements
			- Hydrogen and another
		- [[Oxyacid|oxyacids]]
			- $H_2SO_4$
	- When you think of binary, think of 2
	- Exception
		- HCN is considered a binary acid (contains 3 elements)
			- Not typically what we'll usually see
	- [[Binary acid|binary acids]] (all 3 examples here are molecular compounds. All nonmetals)
		- [[HCL]] is the most famous acid
			- In swimming pool, stomach, chemistry lab
			- hydrochloric
				- Start with hydro
				- end with ic
				- chlor is in middle
			- HCl (g) is hydrogen chloride (gas version)
			- HCl (aq) is hydrochloric (aqueous version)
			- Hydro prefix reserved for the binary acids
		- $H_2S$ (aq)
			- hydrosulfuric acid
		- $H_2Se (aq)$
			- hydroselenic acid
	- [[Oxyacid|oxyacids]]
		- If we know the corresponding names to the [[oxyanion|oxyanions]] they are the acid of, it will make your life a little easier
		- Need to memorize [[Polyatomic ion|polyatomic ions]]
			- If we know them, it will be easier to name the corresponding oxyacids
		- Oxoanion vs Oxoacid ^61d7e2
			- $SO_4^{2-}$ makes sulfate to sulfuric acid in $H_2SO_4$
				- I <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ate</mark> something disgusting and said <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">ick</mark>
			- $SO_3^{2-}$ makes sulfite to sulfurous acid in $H_2SO_3$
				- I got appendicitis
					- cite - ous
		- Other examples
			- $HNO_2$ nitrous acid $NO_2^{-}$ nitrite
			- $HNO_3$ nitric acid $NO_3^{-}$ nitrate
		- By memorizing polyatomic ion names, you can translate them right into the corresponding oxyacid names as well

	- Chlorine, bromine, and iodine
		- They have 4 different oxyacids
	- Oxyanions for chlorine
		- $ClO^{-}$: [[hypochlorite]]
			- Lower oxidation state for chlorine
			- [[hypoglycemic]]: means low blood sugar
				- low or below for hypo
			- Sometimes will see it as $OCl^{-}$
				- Totally interchangeable. Totally equivalent
		- $ClO_2^{-}$: [[chlorite]] ion
		- $ClO_3^{-}$: [[chlorate]] ion
		- $ClO_4^{-}$: [[perchlorate]]
			- This has a higher [[oxidation state]] for chlorine than the chlorate ion
				- Don't know what oxidation states are yet until chapter 4
			- For now, we'll say something that has more oxygens than the chlorate ion
			- perchlorate comes from "hyper" as in "hyperactive" but the "hy" is just cut off
		- $HClO$ (or $HOCl$) is hypochlorous acid
		- $HClO_2$: chlorous acid
		- $HClO_3$: chloric acid
		- $HClO_4$: perchloric acid
	- periodic acid
		- for iodine but seems like periodic table
