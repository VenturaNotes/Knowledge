## Summary
- Significant Figures Rules For Zeros
	- (1) Zeroes at the beginning of a number are NOT significant
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">0.000</mark>47
			- Underlined is not significant
	- (2) Zeroes at the end of a number and to the left of the decimal point are NOT significant
		- 54<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">00</mark>
			- Underlined is not significant
	- (3) Zeroes at the end of a number and to the right of the decimal point ARE SIGNIFICANT.
		- 2.54<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">00</mark>
			- Underlined is significant
	- (4) Zeroes in between significant figures ARE SIGNIFICANT
		- 2<mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">00</mark>.16
			- Underlined is significant
- Significant Figures Rules for Mathematical Operations
	- Multiplication / Division
		- The answer is rounded to the same number of significant figures as the term with the fewest significant figures.
	- Addition / Subtraction
		- The answer is rounded to the same decimal place as the most precise decimal place in the least precise term.
- Accuracy and Precision
	- [[Accuracy]] - The degree to which a measurement corresponds to the ‘true’ value.
	- [[Precision]] - Of or relating to how close multiple measurements of the same value are to each other (independent of how close they are to the true value). Related to the repeatability of a measurement.

	- Scientific Notation
	- The size of an atom is a fraction of a nanometer
	- Numbers > 1 have positive powers of 10
	- Numbers < 1 have negative powers of 10
	- Proper for scientific notation to have 1 digit left of the decimal

	- Significant figures
	- Why we use it?
		- Helps with precision
		- Rounding approximations could give inaccurate details on how strong a bridge could be
	- Non-zeros are always significant
	- 2739.1 is considered to be 5 significant figures
	- Examples
		- 0.00047
			- 2 sig figs
		- 5400
			- 2 sig figs
			- $540\overline{0}$ 
				- This shows there are 4 sig figs
			- $5.400 \times 10^3$
				- Zeros to right of decimal are always significant
		- 2.5400
			- 5 sig figs
		- 200.16
			- 5 sig figs
			- zeros in-between significant figures will be sig figs themselves
	- In scientific notation, all of your numbers will always be significant
	- [[Rules for Zeros]]
		- 0 at the beginning of a number is never significant
		- 0 at the end are significant if right of decimal. Not significant if left of decimal (although decimal not shown then?)
		- 0 in middle are significant

	- Multiplication
		- When multiplying terms, your sig figs for the product will equal the term with the lowest sig figs.
			- Can only be as exact as your least exact/precise number
	- Addition
		- The answers round to the same decimal place as the most precise decimal place in the least precise term
			- 1540 is the least precise term and its most precise decimal place is in the tens place. So the sum will be rounded to the tens place.
	- Division
		- cares about the term with the least sig figs
	- Sig figs very important in the laboratory
	- If you need to add and then divide, first find the sig figs in addition (and round) and then find the sig figs in the division ^1572ef

	- Precise & accurate, precise but not accurate, neither precise nor accurate
	- [[Accuracy]] is how close to the true value you are
	- [[Precision]] repeatability of a measurement. How close multiple independent measurements are to each other. Not to the true value.
