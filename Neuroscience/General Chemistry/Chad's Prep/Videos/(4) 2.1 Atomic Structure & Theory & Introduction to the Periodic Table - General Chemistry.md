	- Introduction
		- [[Atomic structure]] / Theory
		- Periodic table of elements
		- Early fathers in modern atomic theory
		- Isotope symbols (atomic number + mass number)
			- Isotopes + calculating atomic mass (learning about relative abundances)
		- [[Subatomic particles]]
			- [[proton|protons]]
			- [[Neutron|neutrons]]
			- [[electron|electrons]]
		- Look at columns as [[groups]] and rows as [[periods]]
	- 4 early fathers of atomic theory
		- [[Dalton]]: Father of modern atomic theory
			- [[Modern atomic theory]] proposes that all of matter is made up of tiny particles called atoms
			- Dalton said there are types of atoms (they're called elements from periodic table which he was unaware of)
			- Said atom of one element is different from atoms of other elements
			- Also said that we make up [[compounds]] by combining atoms of different elements
				- Stated that atoms are not created or destroyed in a chemical reaction (just rearranged in different combinations to make different compounds)
		- Made contributions to structure of that atom
			- [[J. J. Thomson]]
				- Guy that discovered electron
					- mass to charge ratio
						- (didn't actually know the mass or charge itself)
			- [[Robert Millikan]]
				- Built on Thomson
				- Was able to figure out mass and charge of electron
					- Just figured out one (charge of electron) and then with ratio, calculated mass of electron
				- Famous [[Oil Drop Experiment]]
			- [[Ernest Rutherford]]
				- Gives us modern picture of atom
					- Highly concentrated center of mass (nucleus)
				- Old model was [[plum pudding model]]
					- Atom was a soupy mess of protons, neutrons, and electrons
				- Rutherford took a super thin piece of gold foil and shined [[alpha particle|alpha particles]] (which are super tiny particles which are equivalent of a helium nucleus) at the gold foil.
				- Shot a ray of alpha particles at gold foil
					- If the plum pudding model was really accurate, we'd expect the alpha particles to be reflected back or scattered to the side
					- He found that most of the particles went right through the gold foil
						- This told us that most of an atom was mostly made up of empty space
						- Figured that there must be some dense mass not taking most of volume but concentrated
						- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Most of mass of atom is in nucleus at center of atom</mark>
					- Think of shooting a beam of sand through a volleyball net (most sand grains would pass right through)
				- Known for his [[gold foil experiment]]
					- Discovered the nucleus
	- At center of [[atom]], there is a [[nucleus]]
		- In nucleus, there are [[proton|protons]] and [[Neutron|neutrons]]
			- Protons are positively charged
			- Neutrons are neutral
		- In atoms, all of mass of atom is concentrated at center (nucleus)
		- Floating around nucleus are tiny [[electron|electrons]] which is much smaller than the nucleus and much smaller than the protons and neutrons.
			- Electrons also weigh a whole lot less
		- An atom is a fraction of a nanometer (super tiny)
	- All mass concentrated in nucleus for atom
		- All volume is in [[electron cloud]] on outside of nucleus
	- Most of an atom is made up of empty space
	- Electrons have wavelength behavior
	- Electrons are negative

	- [[Fundamental unit of charge]] (giving relative sizes of 3 [[particle|particles]])
		- [[Proton]] has +1 charge
			- $+1.602 \times 10^{-19} C$
				- Charge units is in [[Coulomb|coulombs]]
				- Whatever is charged in nature is some multiple of this charge
			- [[Atomic mass unit]]
				- Weighs approximately 1 amu
				- More exact is 1.00728 amu
		- [[Electron]] has -1 charge
			- $-1.602 \times 10^{-19} C$
			- Weighs around 2000 times less than either a proton or neutron
				- Weighs around 1/1841 or 1/2000 of an amu
					- Maybe 0.0005 amu (basically rounded to 0)
			- Electrons much smaller than protons or neutrons
		- Coulomb number fairly important in a physics class
			- In general chemistry, we may never see this number again in the course
		- [[Neutron]]
			- $\sim$ 1 amu
				- More exact is 1.00867 amu
			- Slightly heavier than proton
	- [[Isotope|Isotopes]]
		- $^{16}_8O^{2-}$
			- Isotope symbol
				- Showing isotope notation
			- 3 characteristic numbers
			- [[Atomic number]]: Number of protons in nucleus
				- Bottom-left: 8
				- Number of protons defines what element we have
				- In periodic table, atomic number is above element. So above oxygen is 8
			- [[Mass number]]:
				- Top-left: 16
				- How many neutrons in nucleus can vary
				- If we have an oxygen nucleus, we will have 8 protons in it
				- Not all atoms of an element are exactly alike
				- All elements will have the same number of protons but may have a different number of neutrons
				- In the case of oxygen, most common isotope is oxygen-16 (most common and abundant in nature)
					- Doesn't weigh exactly 16 but close to 16
					- Can view number in amu as an approximate whole number
				- Combination between protons and neutrons
					- To find # of neutrons, do "mass number - atomic number" = 8 neutrons
				- Oxygen-18 also exists
			- [[Charge]]: Means an imbalance between protons and electrons
				- top-right: 2-
				- Negative charge means more electrons than protons
					- Atoms can lose and gain electrons
					- If you have a negative charge (need to add electrons to figure out how many you have)
				- We have 10 electrons
					- atomic number (8) + negative charge (2-) = 10
				- If charge is neutral, you'd have an equal amount of protons and electrons
			- Chemical symbol for oxygen as example
			- With a neutral atom, it's called an [[atom]]
				- If atom has a charge, it's called an [[ion]] ^b327f9
					- Positively charged ion: [[cation]]
					- Negatively charged ion: [[anion]]
	- [[Atomic weight]] / atomic mass (not necessarily the same thing? [^2])
		- Also shown on the periodic table
			- For Oxygen, it's 15.9994
			- Different from mass number
			- Mass number corresponds to one individual isotope
			- Atomic weight is an average of the masses of all the naturally occurring isotopes
				- We'd take a [[weighted average]] (weights the thing that most prevalent/abundant more heavily). That's why the average comes really close to 16 for Oxygen
			- Oxygen-16 and Oxygen-18 are the 2 most abundant isotopes
				- Way more 16 than 18
				- Over 99% is Oxygen-16. Less than 1% is Oxygen-18
		- Major isotope for Carbon is Carbon-12
			- Roughly 99% of naturally occurring carbon is Carbon-12
		- Most abundant isotope for hydrogen is hydrogen-1
		- Most abundant isotope for helium is helium-4
		- Bromine has 2 major isotopes
			- Bromine-79
				- 50.5%
			- Bromine-81
				- 49.5%
		- Chlorine has 2 major isotopes
			- Chlorine-35
				- 75%
			- Chlorine-37
				- 25%
			- To calculate weighted average (atomic weight)
				- (0.75)(35) + (0.25)(37)
					- Relative abundance $\times$ corresponding mass in amu

	- We have roughly 120 elements on periodic table
	- [[Groups]] are columns
		- Group together things that have similar properties. Physical and chemical properties
		- Find somebody who has similar chemical reactivity to fluorine
			- chlorine, bromine, iodine (somebody in the same group)
	- [[Periods]] are rows:
		- [[Noble gases]] are chemically inert
		- Will periodically run across someone who has the same chemical property
	- Given staircase on [[periodic table]]
		- Anything to the left of the staircase is [[metals]]
		- Anything to the right of the staircase are [[non-metals]]
		- Along the staircase (silicon, germanium, arsenic) that is what we call the semi-metals or [[metalloids]]
			- There is only around 5 of them (intermediate. Properties of both metals and non-metals)
	- 4 groups we need to know the name of
		- Group 1 is first column
			- [[Alkali metals]]
				- Really reactive with water (sodium down)
		- Group 2 is second column
			- [[Alkaline Earth Metals]]
				- Reactive but not as reactive as alkali metals
		- Group 7
			- [[Halogens]]
				- Fluorine, Chlorine, Bromine, and Iodine
		- Group 8
			- [[Noble Gases]] 
				- Helium, Neon, Argon, Krypton, Xenon, Radon
				- Chemically Inert
	- Oxygen group is called the [[Chalcogen]]
		- Not typically something we need to know
	- [[Transition metals]]
		- Zinc, cadmium, or mercury may or may not be considered transition metals
	- Sometimes called heavy metals?
		- [[Lanthanides]]
		- [[Actinides]]
