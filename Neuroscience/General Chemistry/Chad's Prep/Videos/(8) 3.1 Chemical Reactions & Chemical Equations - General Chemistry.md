	- [[Stoichiometry]] revolves around the mol. Avogadro's number
		- Introducing reactions and equations first
	- 5 different types of reactions (4 out of 5 will learn how to predict products)
	- Will learn how to balance reactions as well
	- [[Chemical reactions]]
		- (1) [[Combination (Chemistry)|Combination]]
			- 2 things are combining
			- Combining elemental metal with an elemental non-metal
				- [[Chlorine]] is a [[Diatomics|diatomic]]
			- When mixing metal and non-metal, will get an [[ionic compound]]
				- A proper ionic compound has no overall charge
			- As long as the monatomic ions are not transition metals or on staircase, you can predict their charge
			- We can recognize as a combination reaction because you have 2 [[reactants]] and only one [[product (Chemistry)|product]]
				- 2 or more reactants forming just a single product
			- Given:
				- $Na (s) + Cl_2 (g) \to$ 
				- Solve
					- $2Na (s) + Cl_2 (g) \to 2NaCl$ 
						- We know that we'll have 1 Na for every Cl due to chlorine wanting an electron and sodium trying to lose an electron
						- Then just needed to add a coefficient of 2 to balance out the reaction
		- (2) [[Decomposition (Chemistry)|Decomposition]] reaction
			- We have a single reactant breaking up into multiple parts (when you have 1 reactant but more than 1 product)
				- Don't usually expect to predict products for this
			- Most decompositions are called a thermal decomposition (requires heat. $\Delta$ used to represent heat (or application of heat)). 
				- Heat doesn't always need to be written for it to be a decomposition reaction
			- When not putting a coefficient in front of a reactant, it's implied that there is a 1 there.
		- (3) [[Combustion]]
			- Like burning something
			- You can't combust something on the moon because there is no atmosphere or oxygen
			- The reaction of something with oxygen gas is combustion
			- To put out a fire, you can cover it in water.
			- Chemistry labs typically equipped with fire blanket
				- If someone catches fire, you wrap them in a blanket to separate them from the oxygen in the room. By limiting the oxygen the fire has access to, you can limit the fire and even put it out.
				- If you burn something flammable in a [[beaker]], putting a [[watch glass]] on top and once the oxygen inside the beaker is all burned up, the fire goes out
			- Need oxygen to have a fire so you need oxygen to have combustion
			- [[Propane]]: $C_3H_8$ (g)
				- Will learn about the combustion of propane
				- You can technically do combustion of things other than [[hydrocarbon|hydrocarbons]]
					- Hydrocarbon is a compound just made up of hydrogen and carbon [^1]
						- Could put oxygen in it as well (which would make it more than just a hydrocarbon)
						- No other elements will be involved in this stage of the game
				- For a hydrocarbon, when you do combustion, you're always going to form carbon dioxide and water
					- Balancing can be very difficult
						- Want to look for an element that only shows up in one location on both sides of the arrow
							- Carbon works for this example since it only shows up in one reactant and one product
			- Oxygen is always the other reactant in combustion
		- (4) [[Double Replacement]]
			- $AgNO_{3(aq)} + Na_2S_{aq} \to$
			- Could be called double displacement
			- Also called metathesis and exchange reactions
			- [[aqueous reaction]]
				- Typically takes place in water
		- (5) [[Single Replacement]]
			- Could be called single displacement
			- [[aqueous reaction]]
				- Typically takes place in water
