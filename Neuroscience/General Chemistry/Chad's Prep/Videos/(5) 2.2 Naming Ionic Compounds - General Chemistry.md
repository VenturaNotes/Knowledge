	- [[Ionic compound|Ionic compounds]]
		- Nomenclature
	- Types of compounds
		- [[Ionic compound]]
			- [[Metal]] combined with a [[nonmetal]]
				- NaCL (sodium chloride)
		- [[Molecular compound]]
			- [[Binary molecular compound]] (composed of 2 elements.)
				- [[Nonmetal]] with a [[nonmetal]]
		- [[Acids]]: (When naming something as an acid, will only name it as an acid when dissolved in water and is [[aqueous]])
			- [[Binary acid]]
				- Will always start off with "H" in formula
				- Will just have one other element (is exception but won't worry about it)
				- Example
					- HCL (2 nonmetals)
						- Strong acid (molecular compound)
					- HCL (aq)
						- When dissolved in water like this, then it's a binary acid
			- [[Oxyacid]]
				- Corresponding anion associated with it (polyatomic ions as part of it)
				- Will have an [[oxyanion]] as part of it
					- $H_2SO_4$ ([[sulfuric acid]])
						- Acid starting with Hs of the [[sulfate ion]]
						- Still molecular, still all non-metals (therefore not ionic)
	- [[Hydrogen]] is a [[nonmetal]]
	- [[Monatomic ion]]
	- [[Polyatomic ion|Polyatomic ions]] (instead of a single type of atom/element. We're going to end up with many atoms of different elements (many containing oxygen) as part of this. Poly-atom-ion) ^05a202
		- [[Sulfate]]: $SO_4^{2-}$
		- [[Sulfite]]: $SO_3^{2-}$
		- [[Nitrate]]: $NO_3^{-}$
		- [[Nitrite]]: $NO_2^{-}$
		- [[Phosphate]]: $PO_4^{3-}$
		- [[Carbonate]]: $CO_3^{2-}$
		- [[Bicarbonate]]: $HCO_3^{-}$
		- [[Hydroxide]]: $OH^-$
		- [[Permanganate]]: $MnO_4^{-}$
		- [[Chromate]]: $CrO_4^{2-}$
		- [[Dichromate]]: $Cr_2O_7^{2-}$
		- [[Ammonium]]: $NH_4^{+}$
		- [[Cyanide]]: $CN^{-}$
		- Separate
			- [[Hypochlorite]]: $ClO^{-}$
			- [[Chlorite]]: $ClO_2^{-}$
			- [[Chlorate]]: $ClO_3^{-}$
			- [[Perchlorate]]: $ClO_4^{-}$
			- (for Br and I also)
	- [[Ionic compound]]
		- NaCL (sodium chloride)
			- Not a person or proper noun (so don't capitalize unless at beginning of sentence)
		- Naming [[Ionic compound|ionic compounds]]
			- (1) Name the [[cation]] (metal or polyatomic cation)
			- (2) State the metal's [[oxidation state]] as a roman numeral in parenthesis
				- (except Group I/II metals, $Al^{3+}$, $Zn^{2+}$, $Cd^{2+}$, $Ag^{+}$)
			- (3) Name the non-metal with an -ide ending (or name the polyatomic anion)
			- Cu(I)= [[cuprous]], Cu(II) = [[cupric]], Fe(II) = [[ferrous]], Fe(III) [[ferric]]
				- Common names for [[copper]] and [[iron]]
		- Write cation first and anion second
		- Nonmetals tend to gain electrons
			- Group 7 typically wants -1 charge as an ion
			- Group 6 typically wants -2 charge as an ion
			- Group 5 typically wants -3 charge as an ion
		- Neutral oxygen is $O_2$ ([[diatomics]])
		- Metals want to lose electrons (as monatomic ions)
			- Want to be closest to noble gases
			- Alkali metals
			- alkaline earth metals
		- Transition metals and metals under staircase can take on multiple charges. That is a problem which means we need to know what they are
		- Ionic compound
			- Has cations and anions but has no overall charge
		- Can find charge of $Cu$ in $CuCl$ by knowing that since $Cl$ wants to be $Cl^{-1}$, this means $Cu$ must be $Cu^{+1}$ since the ionic compound should have no overall charge
			- $CuCl$ = copper(I) Chloride
			- $CuCl_2$ = copper(II) Chloride
		- Must memorize these (these take on just one charge)
			- [[Silver]]
				- $Ag^{+1}$ will always be this way as an ion
			- [[Cadmium]]
				- $Cd^{2+}$ will always be this ion
			- [[Zinc]]
				- $Zn^{2+}$ will always have this charge as an ion
			- [[Aluminum]]
				- $Al^{3+}$ will always have this charge as an ion
		- Gives us the [[oxidation state]] or charge of metal cation in compound
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Naming ionic compounds with polyatomic ions</mark>
			- $NH_4Br$
				- Ammonium ion ($NH_4$) is a polyatomic ion
			- This is 
		- Need to memorize [[Polyatomic ion|polyatomic ions]]. Both name, formula, and charge
		- Might need to switch between names and formulas
