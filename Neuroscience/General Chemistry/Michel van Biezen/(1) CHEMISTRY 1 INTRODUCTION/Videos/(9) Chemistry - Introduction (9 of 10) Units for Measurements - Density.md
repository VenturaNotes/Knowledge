	- [[Density]] is the ratio of [[mass]] over [[volume]]
		- Units typically used are g/$cm^3$ 
	- Density of water @ 4$\degree$C is 1g/cm^3
		- Anything with a larger density than water will sink to the bottom
		- Anything with a lower density than water will float
	- Gold is 19.3 times as dense as water
	- When dealing with solids, volume is expressed in cubic centimeters. When dealing with liquids, volume is typically expressed in mililiters or liters
