	- [[Matter]]: Anything that occupies space and has mass (made up of atoms)
	- [[Mass]]: Is a measure of the quantity of matter (independent of location) ^b9024a
	- [[Weight (Chemistry)|Weight]]: Force exerted on mass by gravity
	- [[Substance]]: Form of matter that has definitive or constant composition (ex: water, table salt, silver, oxygen)
	- [[Mixture]]: Combination of 2 or more substances
		- Homogeneous: Every portion has exact same ratio (sugar dissolved in water)
		- Heterogeneous: 2 or more substances that look separated (sugar and sand)
	- [[Physical Property]]: Can be measured and observed without changing composition (mass)
	- [[Chemical Property]]: To observe it, we must have a chemical reaction (ionization energy)
		- Ionization energy is when you add or take electrons
