	- Errata
		- It's written that 1 amu $\cong$ mass of 1 proton but Biezen says "approximately"
		- It's written that 1kg $\cong$ 2.2lbs but Biezen says approximately
		- While $\cong$ corresponds to the [[Unicode|unicode]] character U+2245 "APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO", the unicode names are misleading and are really symbolic identifiers than normal names [^1] 
			- In the standard [[ISO 80000-2]] (which describes mathematical signs and symbols), $\cong$ denotes the relations "is congruent to" and "is isomorphic to" for point sets (geometrical figures), and it is also used "for isomorphisms of mathematical structures"
				- Therefore, it has nothing to do with numerical approximations
	- 1kg $\to$ standard SI Unit $\approx$ 2.2lbs (equivalent mass)
		- System international units for mass
		- kg is mass but pounds is weight
			- this is the weight/mass equivalent between the metric system and English system
	- 1g = mass of 1 ml of $H_2O$ @ 4$\degree$C ($1\text{ml} = 1\text{cm}^3$)
		- $4\degree C$ is when water is most dense
	- 1 amu $\approx$ mass of 1 proton or 1 neutron
		- [[Atomic mass unit]]
	- 1 amu = mass of $\frac {1}{12}$ Carbon atom $(\ce{^{12}_{6}C})$
		- Most common [[Isotope|isotope]] of carbon
			- 12 [[nucleon|nucleons]] (12 [[proton|protons]] and [[Neutron|neutrons]] combined in the nucleus)
			- 6 protons
		- This isotope has a mass of 12 amu.
	- 1 lb "=" 453.6gq
		- approximately
		- mass weight equivalence in measurement
	- mass of 1 mol of C atoms = 12g
	- 1 [[mole|mol]] = 6.022 $\times$ $10^{23}$ (atoms) = $N_A$ = [[Avogadro's Number]] ($= 6.022045 \times 10^{23}$)
		- A mol is a certain number of molecules or atoms
		- If you have 6.022 $\times$ $10^{23}$ atoms of carbon, you'll have 12g of carbon
	- $\frac {1g}{N_A} = \frac {1g}{6.022 \times 10^{23}} = 1 \text{amu}$
		- If we talk about molecular mass in terms of grams, then we need a mol of the stuff to talk about grams
		- If we talk about single molecules, we'll probably be talking about amu
