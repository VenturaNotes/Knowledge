	- [[kelvin]] scale (k)
		- based on the [[absolute zero]]
			- Coldest it can get anywhere in the universe
			- Called the zero point for the kelvin scale 0k
	- [[Centigrade]] scale
	- [[Fahrenheit]] scale
	- Kelvin scale and centigrade scale both have the same size units
		- 1 kelvin degree is the same as 1 centigrade degree
		- differ by 273.15$\degree$
	- [[Freezing]] point of water is $0\degree C$ at standard pressure
	- [[Boiling]] point of water is $100\degree C$ at standard pressure
	- $1C\degree$ = $\frac {9}{5} F\degree$ (size-wise)
		- $1 \degree C \ne 1C\degree$
			- $1\degree C$ = an actual temperature measurement. It's one degree above 0
				- Actual temperature
			- $1C\degree$ = the delta. The difference between 14 and 15 or 20 and 21
				- Size of the degree
	- Scale conversions
		- k $\to$ C
		- C $\to$ F
		- F $\to$ C
	- $37\degree C$ is human body temperature
		- 98.6$\degree$F
