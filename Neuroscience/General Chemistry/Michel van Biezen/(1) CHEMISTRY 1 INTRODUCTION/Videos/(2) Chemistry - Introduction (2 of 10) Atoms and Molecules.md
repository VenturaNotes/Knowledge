	- Top-left is a pictorial of a hydrogen atom
		- Atom is something that has a nucleus
			- Nucleus contains protons and neutrons
				- Protons and neutrons are building blocks of an atom
			- The number of protons determines the type of atom you have
	- Number of electrons in atom (which circles around the nucleus) will equal the number of protons
		- In Oxygen, since there is 8 protons in the nucleus, it will have 8 electrons
			- Electrons tend to find locations around nucleus where there is room for them. Usually decided by energy levels that the electrons can find around the nucleus
			- Oxygen has inner energy level which has room for 2 electrons
				- Second energy level has room for 8 electrons
					- Means open spots for 2 more electrons
						- Oxygen doesn't need those 2 electrons because it only has 8 protons (neutral - same number of positive charges as negative charges)
	- Hydrogen only has one electron in its innermost energy level (meaning hydrogen has room for one more electron)
	- Atoms like to fill up these empty spots
		- Tendency for chemical change so that electron is captured to fill that extra spot
			- Means valence level of electrons completely filled
	- Hydrogen can lose or gain 1 electron and be fine
	- Oxygen more likely to want extra electron than hydrogen
		- Atoms will be ionized (will be called an ion)
	- When two or more atoms join together (because of electrical forces attracting them together), then we turn atoms into molecules.
		- Most substances in universe is when atoms join together to form molecules
	- Hydrogen is the only atom in the universe that does not have a neutron in its nucleus
	- Heavier elements on the periodic table tend to have more neutrons than protons
	- Electrons zip around the nucleus at very high speeds
	- Nucleus has predominant amount of mass of atom
	- More than 99.9% of all the mass of an atom is contained within nucleus
		- Less than one-tenth of 1% is the mass of electrons contributing to the atom
	- Electrons are what gives the atoms volume
		- When putting atoms on top of each other, you are basically stacking electron shells on top of one another.
			- If you just had nucleus on nucleus, matter would almost have no volume
	- Molecules can be formed by taking the same atoms and binding them together
		- Can take one hydrogen and another, and join them together (would end up sharing 2 electrons each one has). Mixture of a covalent and ionic bond.
			- Diatomic molecule of 2 hydrogens 
	- Semi-ionic bond with 2 oxygen atoms bonded. Will share 4 electrons and have 4 electrons each for themselves. Forms more of a covalent bond actually
		- Diatomic molecule of 2 oxygens
	- Can also have 1 oxygen joined together with 2 hydrogens
		- Shares electrons. Part of time hydrogen gets 2 electrons. Sharing of covalent bonding going on between the atoms
	- Single bond between 2 hydrogen atoms
	- Double bond is 4 electrons being shared between 2 oxygen atoms
	- 2 single bonds between each hydrogen and oxygen
	- The electrical attraction that occurs and need for outer shells to be completely filled with electrons, the forces join together to form molecules out of single atoms. That's why we have atoms and molecules in the universe
