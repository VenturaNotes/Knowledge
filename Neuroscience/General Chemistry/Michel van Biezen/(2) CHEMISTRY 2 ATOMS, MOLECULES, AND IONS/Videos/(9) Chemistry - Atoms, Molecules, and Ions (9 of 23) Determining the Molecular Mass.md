	- Errata
		- m of 1 $SO_2$ <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">molecule</mark>
			- Don't know why he's called molecules atoms
	- [[molecular mass|Molecular mass]]: mass of a molecule
	- [[Molar Mass|Molar mass]]: mass of a mol of molecules
	- molar mass of sulfur = 32.07g
		- This is the mass per mol of sulfur atoms
	- [[Mass]] of 1 S atom = 32.07 amu
		- On average because there will be different isotopes of sulfur and some will be more massive and some will be a little less
	- $SO_2$: [[Sulfur dioxide]]
	- $C_6H_8O_6$: [[ascorbic acid]] (vitamin c). 
	- Definition of [[Atomic mass unit|amu]]
		- It is exactly  $\frac {1}{12}$ the mass of a carbon atom (specifically the Carbon-12 atom)
			- Carbon-12 atom is the most abundant of the two stable isotopes of carbon[^1]
	- Since we're looking for the molecular mass, we want to express that in terms of amu for a single atom or molecule. When we talk about a mol of them, we write the equivalent number but with grams in behind it. This is where the ratio comes in between mass of an atom and mass of a molecule
		- Molecular mass is in amu and molar mass is in grams
