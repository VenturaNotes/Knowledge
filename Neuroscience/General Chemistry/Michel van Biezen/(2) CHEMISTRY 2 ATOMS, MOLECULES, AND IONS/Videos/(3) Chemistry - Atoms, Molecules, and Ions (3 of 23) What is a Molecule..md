	- Ions either lose or gain an electron
	- Sodium is an atom that is easily ionized (meaning we can easily remove an electron from the atom)
		- Will be positively charged
	- There is more room than 8 electrons in the 3rd energy level
		- At least room in s and p orbitals for 8 electrons (1 missing for chlorine)
		- Tendency for atoms to fill open spot with electron
			- There is a force pulling an electron in
	- Cation and anion will attract each other as they're opposite charges
		- Will form a bond becoming a molecule
	- We like to write the nucleus with the number of electrons in the outer shell
		- A molecule is formed through the attractive forces between negative and positive ions
	- Sodium chloride is the chemical name for a simple salt 
		- The salt our bodies need (salt in salt shaker)
			- Table salt or edible salt (we consume and need in our bodies)
	- Sodium is a metal and chlorine is a nonmetal
	- 2 oxygen atoms share electrons (has 6 electrons in outermost shell)
		- 50% of the time, the shared electrons are at one oxygen atom and 50% at the other.
		- 4 electrons become 4 shared electrons between the 2 oxygen atoms
		- 1 oxygen atom will be more negatively charged and the other oxygen atom will be more positively charged. Their charges will constantly switch
		- Forms the $O_2$ molecule which is the way oxygen exists in our atmosphere
	- Molecules are formed by taking atoms that either lack or an excess of electrons
		- Electrons are then shared causing atoms to become electrically charged
			- Attract each other because of difference in electrical charge
