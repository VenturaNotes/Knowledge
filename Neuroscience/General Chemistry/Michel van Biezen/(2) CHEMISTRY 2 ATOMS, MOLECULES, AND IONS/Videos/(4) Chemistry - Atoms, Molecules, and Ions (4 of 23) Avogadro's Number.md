	- amu is the unit that we use to measure the mass of a single atom ^ed0f51
		- Helium atom has 4 nucleons in nucleus (2 protons and 2 neutrons)
	- A dozen means 12 and a gross is a dozen dozen or 12
	- [[mole|mol]] is used to represent a really big number
	- [[Avogadro's number]] (not an exact number but a number that's been experimentally figured out)
		- 6.022 $\times$ $10^{23}$
		- Can me used to figure out mass of an atom given [[Molar Mass|molar mass]] and Avogadro's number
	- The number you want to multiply 1 by to get the number of molecules/atoms such that the mass in grams is equal to the mass in amu
	- 12 amu = $1.99 \times 10^{-21}g$
