	- [[Cation]]: Is an ion with a net positive charge (electrons removed)
	- [[Anion]]: Is an ion with a net negative charge (electrons added)
	- An [[ion]] is an atom that has an electron either added or removed
	- A typical atom has a nucleus at the center where all the protons and neutrons are. The protons are charged which will indicate the sodium nucleus having 11 positive charges. Around the nucleus we have regions where the electrons can exist which are called [[energy level]] or shells
		- Innermost energy level has room for 2 electrons
			- Those electrons reside in an orbital or subshell
			- [[S Orbital|S orbital]] of first level
				- S orbital is spherical in shape
		- Second energy level (room for 8 electrons)
			- Another S orbital (spherical in shape containing 2 electrons)
			- Has 3 [[P Orbital|P orbitals]]
				- Different shape (not spherical). Bulges out in 2 different directions
		- Third energy level (able to contain 18 electrons. 9 orbitals each containing 2 electrons)
			- 1 S orbital
			- 3 P orbitals
			- 5 [[D Orbital|D orbitals]]
	- Another atom with a very strong electron pull for the Na atom will be able to rip off the electron in the third energy level easily.
	- A positively charged ion (cation) and a negatively charged ion (anion). Those two atoms would attract each other because they're oppositely charged and would bond together because of charged difference. Would create sodium chloride which is the common name for salt
