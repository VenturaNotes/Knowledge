	- How many moles in a 14.500g sample of He?
	- What is the mass of 20 mol of silver atoms
	- [[Molar Mass|Molar mass]] is the mass of a mol of anything
		- Such as mol of helium atoms or mol of silver atoms
	- Small "n" is used to represent the number of [[mole|mols]]
	- Molar mass of helium is 4.003g
	- If given [[atomic mass]] (mass of a single atom), then we can use that same number and call it the number of grams for the mol of the same thing
		- [[Molar Mass|Molar mass]]
	- mass of 1Ag atom = 107.9amu
		- = mass of 1 mol of Ag atoms = 107.9g
