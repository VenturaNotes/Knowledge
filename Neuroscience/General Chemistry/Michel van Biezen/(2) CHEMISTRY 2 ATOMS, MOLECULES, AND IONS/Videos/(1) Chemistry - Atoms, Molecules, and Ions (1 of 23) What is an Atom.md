	- Most [[lithium]] atoms have 3 [[proton|protons]] and 4 [[Neutron|neutrons]]
		- Number of protons define the element
		- Neutrons are there to keep the nuclear forces and electrical repulsive forces to keep nucleus together
		- Neutrons are there to help keep nucleus intact
		- Protons have an equal number of [[electron|electrons]] flying around the nucleus at very high speed
		- 2 electrons in innermost energy level
		- 1 electron in 2nd energy level
	- Nucleus $\to$ protons and neutrons
	- The place where electrons reside around the nucleus is divided into energy region
		- Electrons typically like to be as close as possible to the nucleus because they tend to attract each other
	- [[Hydrogen]] is the most simple [[atom]] in the universe
		- Has a single proton in nucleus and a single electron going around it
		- No neutrons in nucleus (unless you have the isotope [[deuterium]])
	- Number of neutrons typically greater than or equal to the number of protons
	- [[Nucleus]] tends to be extremely small
		- Diameter typically between 2 to 3 femtometers
		- Diameter of an atom with electrons is typically $10^{-10}$ meters
			- easily a factor of 50,000 to 1 or 20,000 to 1 between diameter of nucleus and diameter of orbits of electrons
	- Vast majority of mass is in the nucleus
		- Electrons have virtually no mass
	- Roughly speaking, mass of a proton is about 2,000 times the mass of an electron
		- Approximately 1852 times
		- More than 99.9% of mass in atom is in its nucleus
			- Almost no mass resides in electrons around it
	- Why do we need electrons?
		- Protons attract negative charges (natural attraction between nucleus and electrons)
		- Electrons gives atom its shape and solidity
	- Size of atom is determined by the orbit of electrons (not the nucleus of the atom)
		- If you have a basketball as a hydrogen proton, the electron would have an orbit with a diameter of 10 miles.
	- An electron in a hydrogen atom goes around the nucleus 6 thousand trillion times per second
		- The path it takes is a [[spherical shell]]
	- The number of times the electron goes around is so enormous that it basically forms a presence continuously around the nucleus so that it basically forms a hard shell that makes up the volume of the atom
		- So if you placed 2 atoms together, the closest that the 2 nuclei of the 2 atoms can get together would be 10 miles (in given real-world scenario above)
	- Atoms are basically empty volumes with a tiny amount of volume representing the nucleus where almost all of its mass resides and the rest is just empty space
	- Electron basically forms a hard shell presence around the nucleus making it difficult to go through
	- The entire world population of 7 billion people could fit into the cap of a marker if all the space between the nuclei had been squished down to zero.
