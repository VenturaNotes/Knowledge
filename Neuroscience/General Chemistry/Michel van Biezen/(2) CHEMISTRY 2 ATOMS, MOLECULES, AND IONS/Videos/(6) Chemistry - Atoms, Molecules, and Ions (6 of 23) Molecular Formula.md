	- [[Molecular formula]] shows the exact number of atoms of each element in a molecule
		- $H_2$ means there are 2 hydrogen atoms in the molecule
	- $NH_3$ [[ammonia]]
	- $H_2O_2$ [[hydrogen peroxide]]
		- Use for medical purposes to clean out wounds
	- $N_2H_4$ dinitrogen tetrahydride ([[hydrazine]])
		- Di means 2 (2 nitrogen atoms)
		- tetra means 4 (4 hydrogen atoms)
		- Flammable molecule used for rocket fuel
	- $C_6H_{12}O_6$ [[Glucose]] (used for the human body)
		- Form of sugar
		- Total of 24 atoms in single molecule
	- Can find out the percentage of each constituent in the molecule as a percentage of the whole molecule
	- 180amu is the molecular mass of the molecule
		- You find the molecular mass by adding the atomic mass of each element
