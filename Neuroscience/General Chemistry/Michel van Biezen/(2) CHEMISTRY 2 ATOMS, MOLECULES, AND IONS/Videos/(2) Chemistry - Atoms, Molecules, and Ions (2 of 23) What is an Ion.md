	- Since sodium has 11 protons in the nucleus, it will have 11 electrons around the nucleus
	- The place where the electrons reside are called shells (energy levels)
	- The innermost energy level is called the s shell.
		- Only room for 2 electrons
	- Second energy level has room for 8 electrons
	- The single electron in 3rd shell of sodium is relatively easy to remove
		- If something else comes along that pulls hard enough on electron to remove it, the sodium will now miss an electron
		- Then sodium would have 11 protons and 10 electrons
			- There are 11 positive charges and 10 negative charges
				- This would cause sodium to become positively charged by a +1 amount ($Na^{+1}$)
				- This makes sodium an [[ion]]
					- Anytime you have an atom which has an electron removed now turns into a positive ion ([[cation]])
	- Fluorine (9 protons in the nucleus so 9 electrons)
		- 7 electrons in 2nd shell
		- 9 protons and 9 electrons causes it to be electrically neutral and an atom
		- If Fluorine gains an electron, this creates an [[anion]] which is a negatively charged ion
	- If Fluorine took Sodium's electron, the 2 ions would chemically bond together
		- When you add or subtract electrons from shells around nucleus of an atom, it turns an atom into an ion. The ones that become ions will be a force of repulsion and attraction
			- The ones that attract each other will form what we call [[molecules]].
				- This is the basis of how molecules are formed by turning atoms into ions by either removing or adding electrons
