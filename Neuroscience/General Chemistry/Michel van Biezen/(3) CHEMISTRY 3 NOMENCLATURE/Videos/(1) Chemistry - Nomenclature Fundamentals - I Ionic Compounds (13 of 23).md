	- [[cation]] $\to$ Donates 1 or more electrons
		- Positive Ions
	- [[anion]] $\to$ Receives 1 or more electrons
		- Negative ions
	- Cations + anions (bond due to electrical attraction)
		- (Regular Name) + (First Part + "IDE")
		- $Na^+ + Cl^-$ 
			- Sodium Chloride
	- [[Nomenclature]]
	- [[Ionic compound]]
		- Compounds created by exchanging electrons so that the elements that are doing the exchanging become [[ion|ions]] and then become electrically attracted to one another.
		- Want to exchange electrons to go to a lower energy state
			- This happens because energy is released and we're now in a lower more stable energy state
	- All elements below hydrogen in column have a tendency when becoming ionized to give off 1 electron
		- Makes sense because they all have one extra electron in the outermost energy level
			- More than happy to give electron away
		- [[nonmetal|nonmetals]] tend to be very strong attractors of electron and tend to rip the electron off the first column elements
	- Second column has 2 electrons in outermost energy level
		- If the elements become ionized, gives both electrons away to become cations with a + 2 charge
	- In the metallic region of periodic table, have a very specific way of electrons being removed
		- [[Aluminum]]
			- Only exists as an atom or as an ion with 3 electrons removed
		- [[Zinc]]
			- Only exists as an atom or as an ion with 2 electrons removed
		- [[Silver]]
			- When it's ionized, tends to give away 1 electron to become a +1 charged
			- History
				- Ag stands for "argentum" which is the latin name for silver
				- That's why the word for money in french is argent (which comes from the word silver because they used to make money out of the silver pieces)
	- [[anion|anions]]
		- [[Nitrogen]] tends to attract 3 electrons (-3 charge when becoming ions)
		- [[Oxygen]] and [[Sulfur]] attracts 2 electrons
		- [[Fluorine]], [[Chlorine]], [[Bromine]] attracts 1 electron
	- Left side of periodic table will typically react with right side to form compounds
	- It's $Li_2O$ because you need them to be electrically balanced
	- How do we know they have a certain amount of elements per compound?
		- There is no choice
		- They only become ionized in one particular way
		- Therefore, no multitude of names to describe the various combinations that could exist
		- Only one combination in each kind of bond between the cations and anions of the ones indicated
