	- Why we developed units of measurement
		- How far apart are two cities. 
		- When did something happen. 
		- How long before it happens again?
	- Some correlate with natural phenomena (day, year, which are based on motion of Earth).
		- However, many are arbitrary like most units of length and mass
	- Have to be careful not to make an estimate that is more precise than our measuring abilities allow
		- When using measuring devices, we only estimate one digit further than the level of precision inherent in the instrument
		- In ruler example with cm, we can estimate the length of 2.33cm but not 2.33481 because we do not have access to that level of precision
	- Any measurement will have a certain amount of [[significant figures]] (or sig figs) associated with it that display how precise it is
	- Rules for determining number of sig figs
		- (1) Non-zero digits are significant
			- 316 = 3 sig figs
		- (2) Zeros in between other digits are significant. 
			- 6.003 = 4 sig figs
		- (3) Leading zeros are not significant
			- 0.00035 = 2 sig figs
		- (4) Trailing decimal zeros are significant
			- 35,000 = 2 sig figs
			- 0.035000 = 5 sig figs
	- 10,000 only has 1 significant figure. This means it's "about" 10,000
		- Anything from 9,500 to 90,499 would round to 10,000
	- Rules for Calculating with Sig Figs
		- (1) When adding or subtracting, use the fewest number of decimal places
		- (2) When multiplying or dividing, use the fewest number of sig figs.
	- Example:
		- Rounding to 3 sig figs
			- 9.365 $\to$ 9.37
				- 5 or higher means round up
			- 9.364 $\to$ 9.36
				- 4 or below means round down
	- Checking Comprehension
		- State the number of sig figs in each value
			- (1) 0.00004050
				- 4 sig figs
			- (2) 54,700
				- 3 sig figs
			- (3) 1,000.09
				- 6 sig figs
			- (4) 0.039
				- 2 sig figs
		- Complete the calculations to the correct number of sig figs:
			- (1) 5.4589 - 2.33
				- 3.13
			- (2) 16.872 + 3.8
				- 20.7
			- (3) 2.33 $\times$ 18
				- 42
			- (4) 31.9 / 7.318
				- 4.36
