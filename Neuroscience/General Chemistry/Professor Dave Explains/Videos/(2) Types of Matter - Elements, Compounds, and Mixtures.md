	- [[Matter]] is anything that has mass and occupies space.
		- It can have many forms
		- 3 phases: solid, liquid and gas
			- A [[Solid|solid]] has fix shape and volume. Particles are touching and do not move
			- A [[Liquid|liquid]] has fixed volume but no fixed shape (it will mold to its container). Particles still touching but they do move fluidly
			- A [[Gas|gas]] has no fixed volume or shape. It will completely fill its container. Particles are far apart moving freely and seldom touch
	- Matter will frequently change forms
	- A [[physical change]] is one in which the chemical composition of the substance is unchanged
		- When ice melts, water is going from the solid phase to the liquid phase
			- The way the water molecules are arranged changes but they are still water molecules
		- A substance changing from one phase to another is always a physical change
	- A [[chemical change]] is when the chemical composition of the substance does change.
		- Chemical bonds between atoms must break and form to generate completely new substances
		- Hydrogen gas and oxygen gas combine to form water
			- Hydrogen and oxygen used to be connected to themselves and are now connected to each other.
				- New bonds, new substance, chemistry has occurred
		- Making an entirely new substance with new chemical bonds is known as a chemical change
	- A [[pure substance]] is one that can't be separated into other materials by any physical processes
		- Water, whether you boil or freeze it will still be water. It's a type of [[molecule]] which is just multiple connected atoms
	- An [[Elements (Chemistry)|element]] can't be broken down into smaller parts by physical or chemical means. 
		- For example, water is not an element. It's a [[compound]] because it's made of two or more elements. In this case, oxygen and hydrogen
			- By a chemical process, we can divide water into two elements but that's as far as we can go with chemistry
				- These are now molecules of a given element

	- A [[mixture]] is made of two or more pure substances and these can be separated by physical processes
		- If you boil salt water, the water will evaporate and the salt won't
			- So the substances will have separated
		- A [[solution (Chemistry)|homogeneous mixture]] means all the substances are distributed evenly and every section looks the same like sugar and water
		- A [[heterogeneous mixture]] means the substances are not distributed evenly and zooming in on different sections would look differently like oil and water
	- Pure substances
		- Elements made of only one type of atom
		- Compounds which are made of different types of atoms but are still just one type of molecule
	- Mixture (made of multiple types of molecules)
		- Arranged in either heterogenous homogeneous fashion
