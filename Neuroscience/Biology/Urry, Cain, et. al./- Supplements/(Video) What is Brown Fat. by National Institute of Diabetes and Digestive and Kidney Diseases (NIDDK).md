- [[Brown Fat]]
	- Recently discovered organ in adult humans
	- Takes the stored fat that it holds onto and then burns it up to keep us warm
	- Different from other fats in 2 specific ways
		- Cell looks brown
		- Stores fat only temporarily (has a goal of taking that fat and burning it up in a moment's notice to help keep person warm)
- Chronic [[mirabegron]] treatment increases human brown fat, [[HDL cholesterol]], and [[insulin sensitivity]]
- [[White fat]]: Job is to store fat and release the fat slowly over time when a person hasn't eaten for some time.
