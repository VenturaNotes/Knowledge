		- [[Information]]
		- [[Energy and Matter]]
		- [[Interactions]]
		- [[Evolution]]
#### (Theme) New Properties Emerge at Successive Levels of Biological Organization
- “Zooming in at ever-finer resolution illustrates the principle that underlies [[reductionism]], an approach that reduces complex systems to simpler components that are more manageable to study.” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=53&annotation=DU3PMIU5))
- “by studying the [[molecular structure]] of [[DNA]] that had been extracted from [[cells]], [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] inferred the chemical basis of [[biological inheritance]].” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=53&annotation=6QRNFXCY))

#### Theme: Life Requires the Transfer and Transformation of Energy and Matter
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-16 at 3.22.01 PM.png]]
	- Description
		- [[Energy flow]] and [[chemical cycling]]
			- One-way flow of energy in an [[ecosystem]]
				- During [[photosynthesis]], plants convert energy from sunlight to [[chemical energy]] (stored in food molecules such as sugars), which is used by 
				  [[plants]] and other organisms to do work and is eventually lost from the [[ecosystem]] as heat.
			- Contrasting, chemicals cycle between [[organisms]] and the [[physical environment]]
		- Energy Flow
			- (1) Light energy comes from the sun
			- (2) Plants convert sunlight to chemical energy
			- (3) Organisms use chemical energy to do work
			- (4) Heat is lost from the ecosystem
		- Chemical cycling
			- Chemicals in plants are passed to organisms that eat the plants
			- [[Decomposer|Decomposers]] such as fungi and bacteria break down leaf litter and dead organisms, returning chemicals to the soil
			- Plants take up chemicals from the [[soil]] and [[air]]
- “Moving, growing, reproducing, and the various cellular activities of life are [[work]], and work requires [[energy]].” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=58&annotation=QGZKKR6V))
- “input of energy, primarily from the sun, and the transformation of energy from one form to another make life possible” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=58&annotation=NGFEZPW4))
- “When a plant’s leaves absorb sunlight in the process of photosynthesis, molecules within the leaves convert the energy of sunlight to the chemical energy of food, such as [[sugars]].”([Urry et al., 2020, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=58&annotation=9RQT9JAB))
- “chemical energy in the food molecules is then passed along from plants and other photosynthetic organisms ([[Producer|producers]]) to [[Consumer|consumers]]” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=58&annotation=I7UWL88N))
	- “[[consumer]] is an organism that feeds on other organisms or their remains.” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=58&annotation=KYFMMZIP))
- “When an organism uses chemical energy to perform [[work]], such as muscle contraction or cell division, some of that energy is lost to the surroundings as [[heat]].” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=58&annotation=BLB4R6DZ))
	- “[[energy]] flows through an ecosystem in one direction, usually entering as light and exiting as heat.” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=58&annotation=WVNAZFXW))
	- “chemicals cycle within an ecosystem, where they are used and then recycled” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=58&annotation=C6ALP92D))
- [[Bacteria]] and [[fungi]] break down waste products
##### Molecules: Interactions Within Organisms
- “lower levels of [[organization]], the interactions between components that make up living organisms—[[organs]], [[tissues]], [[cells]], and [[molecules]]—are crucial to their smooth operation.” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 56](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=59&annotation=VKXUNZI4))
#### Theme: From Molecules to Ecosystems, Interactions Are Important in Biological Systems
- [[Biological Systems]]
- “[[biological hierarchy]], interactions between the components of the system ensure smooth integration of all the parts, such that they function as a whole.” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 55](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=58&annotation=YE76NH7I))
	- True for molecules in a cell and components of an ecosystem
