		- [[Information]]
		- [[Energy and Matter]]
		- [[Interactions]]
		- [[Evolution]]
#### (Theme) New Properties Emerge at Successive Levels of Biological Organization
- “Zooming in at ever-finer resolution illustrates the principle that underlies [[reductionism]], an approach that reduces complex systems to simpler components that are more manageable to study.” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=53&annotation=DU3PMIU5))
- “by studying the [[molecular structure]] of [[DNA]] that had been extracted from [[cells]], [[James Watson]] and [[Francis Crick]] inferred the chemical basis of [[biological inheritance]].” ([Urry et al., 2020, p. 50](zotero://select/library/items/DJ2VRK6E)) ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PBUU3ZVE?page=53&annotation=6QRNFXCY))
