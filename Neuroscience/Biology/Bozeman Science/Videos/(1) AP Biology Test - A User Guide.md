## Score Distribution
- You will get an envelope in the mail in the summer which will show you what your score is.
- This is the distribution of the scores on the 2010 test
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-28 at 8.54.24 AM.png|300]]
- Scores vary from 1-5
	- Anything above 3 is a pass and 2 and below is a fail
	- Here, it shows majority of people failed. Goal is to get highest score as possible. You only get score. Goal is to get highest score. Only 49.2% passed.
## Test setup
- Multiple Choice
	- 100 questions - 80 minutes
	- 60% of total grade
- Free Response
	- 10 minute reading
	- 4 questions - 90 minutes
	- 22 minutes on each about
	- 40% of total grade
- 180,000 people take the test
	- The test is graded by looking at the distribution of scores and create cutoffs for what exam score you get
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-28 at 8.58.10 AM.png]]
		- Is based on how you compare against everyone else.
		- They don't know that until you've taken the test
	- If you do well on multiple choice portion, you'll do well on the test
## Multiple Choice Tips
- You'll get a booklet
	- Will have a series of questions in it (will have 100 questions)
	- Can write in booklet. Will write answers on a bubble sheet
		- Fill in bubble sheet

		- Don't want to be cramming night before
- Buy or borrow a study book
	- AP book Cliffs Notes is good
		- Abbreviated information on each of the different topics
		- Also have practice exams that are important
			- Important for last week before taking test
- Budget your time (45 seconds / question)
	- Some will be easy and others incredibly hard
- Use the process of elimination
	- Cross off ones that are clearly wrong so you can make an educated guess in the end
- Watch out for reverse questions - EXCEPT
	- all of the following are found in eukaryotic cells EXCEPT
		- and if you didn't see the word "except", you will miss question
## Multiple Choice Visual
- 100 questions - 80 minutes
	- Normal (Cross out ones that are clearly wrong and circle the one that is correct)

- Answer and label anything
	- They don't care about an introduction. Just answer the question
- Budget your time (22 minutes / question)
	- Make sure to leave space if you want to solve part B but not finished with part A yet. Want the writing to be neat.
- Understand the <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">direction</mark> words
	- Each question has a series of words that direct you to answer that question in a specific way. It's vital that you understand what the question is asking.
	- If asked to compare and contrast and you just describe, you'll miss all the points.
- Learn the Cliff Notes Fifteen
	- They have 15 essays.
		- Went through the last essays and looked at which ones were the most common.
	- Direction words

### Grading
- (a) Discuss the expected change in biodiversity as the stages of succession progress as shown in the diagram above (2 points maximum; 1 point per bullet)
	- Cannot simply list the organisms depicted (shrubs -> gymnosperms -> angiosperm hardwoods)
		- Biodiversity increases (plants, animals, decomposers).
	- Explanation of why biodiversity increases/changes are observed:
		- Some populations facilitate biodiversity/succession (by developing conditions more suitable for other species and/or developing conditions less suitable for their progeny).
		- Some populations inhibit biodiversity/succession (by developing conditions less suitable for other species and/or developing conditions more suitable for their progeny).
		- Increase in plant stratification (increased layering of plants: e.g., canopy, understory).
		- More niches/habitats formed (plants, animals, decomposers).
		- Pioneer plant species -> dominants (more shade-tolerant plants emerge).
		- Increase in producer diversity brings about increase in consumer diversity.
	- Other
		- Shift from more opportunistic (r) to more equilibrium (k) species
- To answer this question, you would just do 4(a)
- The below is not an exhaustive list

| Description of change in abiotic condition (1 point) | Explanation (why abiotic condition changes) (1 point)                                        | Explanation (why it enhances succession) (1 point)                                                       |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Increase in soil quantity                            | More detritus increases humus; decreased erosion because more plants hold soil in place      | Provides more anchoring for plants.                                                                      |
| Improvement in soil quality                          | Soil gains organic matter (humus).                                                           | Provides more nutrients for plant growth.                                                                |
| More N available to ecosystem                        | Caused by decomposition and/or by nitrogen fixation.                                         | Favors plants with higher nitrogen needs.                                                                |

| Increase in water retained in soil                   | Increased organic matter retains water; increased shading reduces evaporation from the soil. | More water is available for plants.                                                                      |
| Decrease in pH of soil                               | Acids released during decomposition lower pH.                                                | Mobilizes cations facilitating mineral uptake (e.g., $Fe^{++}$, $Ca^{++}$; favors acid-tolerant plants. ) |
| Increase in pH of soil                               | Soil gets more basic with increase in ammonia ($NH_3$).                                      | Favors plants with higher N requirement; favors alkaline-tolerant plants.                                |
| Decrease in temperature                              | Caused by shading.                                                                           | Favors species that are not heat tolerant; inhibits plants needing higher temperatures.                  |
| Decrease in light availability                       | Caused by shading.                                                                           | Increased shading favors shade-tolerant species; inhibits shade-intolerant species.                      |
| Higher humidity                                      | Caused by more transpiration.                                                                | Facilitates transition from relatively xerophytic plants to more mesophytic plants.                                                                                                         |
