	- Types of cells
	- How structures inside cells fit their function
	- Why are cells small?
		- Material moves into a cell through a process called [[diffusion]]
			- [[Oxygen]] gets in that way
			- [[Carbon dioxide]] moves out in the same way
			- Will take a long time for materials to diffuse into a cell
		- By making volume the same but increasing surface area, the distance the material has to move is relatively small
		- Why aren't cells infinitely small?
			- The material inside a cell (information such as DNA and machinery inside cell needs to fit in cell). 
			- There is a perfect sweet spot in size for all the different types of cells we have
	- A cell inside is incredibly complex
		- [[cytoskeleton]]
			- Made up of a number of different macromolecules
			- Like a lattice inside the cell
			- All organelles fit inside that lattice
			- Works almost like a monorail (materials move around on it using [[motor proteins]]. They literally walk as if they have legs on the monorail)
	- Cells often misunderstood. Totally invisible to scientists until we invented the [[microscope]]
		- [[optical microscope]] (would have in a typical biology classroom)
			- Uses light and lenses to magnify image
			- If you use binoculars and turn it upside down and hold it close to your hand, you have a simple microscope
			- [[Paramecium]] shown
		- [[electron microscope]] (the material in order to look at it, the process is actually going to destroy it)
			- Uses a number of [[magnets]] which is used to focus electrons through an image or bouncing it off an image
			- [[Transmission electron microscope]]
				- We see viruses (dead example)
			- [[Scanning electron microscope]]
				- We see ant (dead example)
				- You'd need to put a thin layer of metal on it that we can bounce off of on an SEM
			- Demo
				- Take a big magnet and hold it close to an old television or your computer screen (don't do it though since it would permanently ruin your monitor or computer screen)
				- The magnet is changing the path of the electrons. By doing that, we can increase the magnification of the specimen
		- The future is electron microscopes
			- [[fluorescent optical microscope]]
				- We're coming up with beautiful fluorescent dyes 
				- We can stain material that can stay alive
					- Live-dead stains
						- You would stain it and it would show you all the cells that were alive at that point and dead at that point
	- There are two major types of [[cell|cells]]
		- [[Prokaryotic cells]]
			- Parts
				- [[Pili]]
				- [[Plasmid]]
				- [[Ribosome|ribosomes]]
				- [[Cytoplasm]]
				- [[Plasma membrane]]
				- [[Cell wall]]
				- [[Capsule]]
				- [[Bacterial Flagellum]]
				- [[Nucleoid]] ([[circular DNA]])
			- Lacks a nucleus. Before the egg
			- Includes
				- [[Bacteria]]
				- [[Archaebacteria]]
			- Simpler
		- [[Eukaryotic cells]]
			- Parts
				- [[Flagellum]]
				- [[Smooth endoplasmic reticulum]]
				- [[Rough endoplasmic reticulum]]
				- [[Free ribosomes]]
				- [[cytoskeleton]]
				- [[Peroxisome]]
				- [[Mitochondrion]]
				- [[Plasma membrane]]
				- [[Ribosomes]]
				- [[Nucleus]]
					- [[Nuclear pore]]
					- [[Nuclear envelope]]
					- [[Chromatin]]
					- [[Nucleolus]]
				- [[Golgi vesicles]] ([[Golgi apparatus]])
				- [[Lysosome]]
				- [[Centrioles]]
				- [[Cytoplasm]]
				- [[Secretory vesicle]]
			- They will have a nucleus
			- Usually not microscopic
				- [[plants]]
				- [[animals]]
				- [[fungus]]
				- [[protists]]
			- Will have organelles (organs within cell) such as [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]]
			- Animal cell shown
				- (most parts of podcast will be talking about eukaryotic cells)
		- Scale is bad
			- Bacteria should be about size of [[Mitochondrion|mitochondria]] of eukaryotic cells
		- Similarities 
			- All cells will have
				- nucleic material ([[DNA]])
				- [[cell membranes|cell membrane]] around outside
				- [[cytosol]] on inside
				- [[ribosomes]]
