	- Overview of [[biology]]
		- It's the study of life
	- Lots of disciplines that use the concepts of biology
		- [[Biochemistry]]
		- [[Molecular biology]]
		- [[Wildlife ecology]]
		- [[Evolutionary biology]]
		- [[Biophysicist]]
	- 4 big ideas (that cover all of biology)
		- [[Evolution]]
			- [[Charles Darwin]]
				- He believed that all life shared common ancestry
				- Proponent of [[macroevolution]]
					- In other words [[species]] forming new species
					- First one to come up with mechanism to explain how adaptation and evolution actually works and it's called [[natural selection]]
					- Quintessential example is [[peppered moths]]. They have two different [[phenotypes]] (or physical appearances, dark and light). The trees were light relatively but during the [[industrial revolution]], so much soot coming from coal was making trees turn black
						- If you were a bird back in the day, you would pick on the black moths, but as the trees got darker, the birds were starting to isolate on the white moths
						- Saw a change in the number of those
						- The moths are not changing their appearance. It's just selection in nature that's determining that (natural selection) 
				- There are 5 things that can cause [[evolution]]
					- [[Natural selection]]
						- Allows organisms to become better adapted to their local environment
					- [[Small sample size]]
					- [[non-random mating]]
					- [[mutation|mutations]]
					- [[immigration]] or [[emigration]]
						- movement into or out of a population
					- If we ever get change in the frequency of a [[gene pool]], evolution has occurred
			- [[Phylogenetic tree]] (Looks like old drawing of Darwin)
				- [[Bacteria]]
					- [[Aquifex]]
					- [[Thermotoga]]
					- [[Bacteroides ]]
					- [[Cytophaga]]
					- [[Planctomyces]]
					- [[Cyanobacteria]]
					- [[Proteobacteria]]
					- [[Spirochetes]]
					- [[Gram Positives]]
					- [[Green Filamentous bacteria]]
				- [[Archaea]]
					- [[Pyrodictcum]]
					- [[Thermoproteus]]
					- [[T. celer]]
					- [[Methanococcus]]
					- [[Methanobacterium]]
					- [[Methanosarcina]]
					- [[Halophiles]]
				- [[Eucaryota]]
					- [[Diplomonads]]
					- [[Microsporidia]]
					- [[Trichomonads]]
					- [[Flagellates]]
					- [[Ciliates]]
					- [[Plants]]
					- [[Fungi]]
					- [[Animals]]
						- We are here
					- [[Slime molds]]
					- [[Entamoebae]]
		- [[Free energy]]
			- Energy will flow from [[sun]] to [[Earth]]. On Earth, [[plants]] or [[Producer|producers]] will use process of [[photosynthesis]] to convert [[energy]] into [[sugar]] so they can build plants and use energy.
				- Plants do another process called [[respiration]]
					- A way to release energy found in sugars generally in the form of [[ATP]]
						- It will all leave into eventually something called [[heat]]
			- Free energy is energy available to do work or do something
			- Another idea is maintaining a stable internal environment
				- Must maintain [[homeostasis]]
					- Maintaining a stable environment is what a plant does
					- Not being able to maintain homeostasis means you're dead
				- To do this, we use a [[feedback mechanism]]
					- Best example are speed signs. If you're going too fast you slow down and if you're going too slow you speed up
				- Our [[body temperature]] is $98.6\degree F$ 
					- We maintain that through homeostasis
					- We also maintain the below to keep ourselves alive
						- [[blood glucose level]]
						- [[blood calcium level]]
						- [[osmolarity]]
		- [[Information]] (described in next part)
		- [[Systems]]

	- [[Information]]
		- Information flow from organism to [[organism]]. Generation to generation.
		- The one thing we use to do that is [[DNA]]
			- DNA has really taken over biology
			- It wasn't until the 1950s that we unlocked the shape of it
		- [[DNA]] (Deoxyribonucleic acid)
			- [[Cytosine]]
			- [[Guanine]]
			- [[Adenine]]
			- [[Thymine]]
			- [[Nucleobases of DNA]]
		- DNA is what we call the [[central dogma of life]]
		- DNA sits in the [[nucleus]] of your [[cell]]. It makes [[RNA]] and that RNA makes [[proteins]]. Those proteins make you
			- We are the result of proteins and protein action
			- It's the blueprint or DNA inside you that says this is the proteins you need to make and when you need to do them. That information flow is super important
				- If we went back to first organism, it had DNA (it's been copied, mutated and changed and selected through time to create all the organisms that we have on our planet)
				- Information super important
		- Within DNA is the idea of [[genetics]] and [[genes]]. [[Gregor Mendel]] unlocked that idea
			- We learned how to do [[Punnett squares]]
				- What a [[gene]] is, what an [[allele]] is, is important
		- We're not static
			- We're able to respond to our environment. [[Cell communication]]
				- Cells are communicating with one another
				- [[Signal transduction pathway]]
					- A [[ligand]] hits on a [[protein]] and you have a series of chemical reactions. So we can actually express a gene and we can make a protein do something
				- [[Nerve|nerves]], [[hormones]], and [[pheromones]], are all examples of cell communication
					- It's the transfer of information
					- A wolf howling at night is an example of information transfer
	- [[Systems]]
		- In [[biology]], we're built on this hierarchy of life.
			- Living things are made of [[carbon compounds]]
				- Those are organized into [[macromolecules]] which make [[Organelle|organelles]] which make [[cells]] which make [[tissues]] which make [[organs]] which make [[organ systems]], which make [[organisms]] which make [[populations]] which make [[communities]] and [[ecosystems]] and [[biomes]] and [[Biosphere|biospheres]]
			- At each of the different levels, we start to get [[emergent properties]]
				- Properties that weren't there the level before
		- The way systems are organized is important.
			- Just as important as that is our interactions. Here is [[E.O. Wilson]]. Most famous biologist alive today. He is the referred to as the father of [[biodiversity]]
				- He has become famous for showing that in these major [[ecosystems]], we have interactions between different populations, [[symbiosis]]. All these systems are interacting together
				- All the [[organs]] in an [[organ system]] like the [[circulatory system]] are working together but so are all the [[populations]] in a [[Communities|community]]
		- Systems and interactions are another major theme in biology
