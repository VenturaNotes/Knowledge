	- [[Biology]] organized from very small to very large ([[biosphere]])
		- Each different level is called a [[system (biology)|system]]
			- A system is separated from surroundings using a boundary
		- Non-biological example
			- A city is a system
				- Inside is a school and then a classroom
			- Similar to Russian dolls (larger ones enveloping smaller ones)
	- [[Emergent Properties]]
		- With each level, there will be property/properties that show up which weren't on the level before
			- [[Termite]] protecting mound
			- Each termite inside is an individual system of their own
				- They are working together in a system of a [[colony]]
				- Actually farming a little fungus that grows within the termite mound
			- At larger scale, we have a termite cathedral
				- So big that it faces a major problem
				- [[Carbon dioxide]] fills up on inside of it (due to the termite's [[cellular respiration]]). They could asphyxiate if there was no way to remove it
				- They're designed so that as the wind blows, there is ventilation. Can sweep carbon dioxide away and new oxygen in its place
				- How did termites figure this out?
					- Think of 80 different termite cathedrals
					- In some of those all of the termites die (so genes would die with them)
						- Those with any kind of ventilation would survive (getting an emergent property showing up)

	- Hierarchy of life
		- [[Atom]]
			- Carbon has 4 valence electrons and is very good at bonding
		- [[Molecule]]
			- Carbon to 2 oxygen molecules
			- Emergent property is that it's more stable and sharing electrons (bonded)
		- [[Macromolecule]]
			- Large molecules
			- 4 different types
				- [[Carbohydrates]]
				- [[Proteins]]
				- [[Lipids]]
				- [[Nucleic acids]]
			- Emergent property is that they're built up of [[monomers]] (repeating blocks)
				- Will eventually show [[polymerization]]
		- [[Organelle]]
			- Tiny organs inside cells
			- [[Plasma membrane]] (made of macromolecules)
				- [[phosphate group]] on top which gives emergent property of being able to separate outside and inside of a cell
		- [[Cell]]
			- [[red blood cell]]
			- Going to have plasma membrane inside it.
			- Will have [[hemoglobin]] protein
			- Emergent property is that it can move around and grab oxygen and move that to different parts in the body
		- [[Tissue]]
			- Made up of a bunch of cells working together
			- [[muscle cell]]
				- Striations are an indicator
			- [[Intercalated discs]] 
				- So we know it's [[cardiac muscle]]
					- Contracts to beat your heart
					- Can also receive [[nerve signals]]
		- [[Organ]]
			- With a bunch of tissues organized and working together, we have an organ
			- [[Heart]]
				- Will have all 4 different types of tissues inside it
					- [[Muscle tissue]]
					- [[nervous tissue]]
					- [[connective tissue]]
					- [[epithelial tissue]]
						- on inside
					- All tissues working together with single purpose
				- Parts
					- [[Brachiocephalic artery]]
					- [[Superior vena cava]]
					- [[Right pulmonary arteries]]

			- Heart sitting inside organ system (circulatory system)
				- Have red blood cell, heart, and arteries and veins to move red blood cell around body
		- [[Organisms]]
			- An [[elk]] is made up of a number of organ systems working together
- ![[Screenshot 2024-01-29 at 3.56.26 AM.png]]
	- Hierarchy of life (Continued)
		- [[Population (Biology)|Population]]
			- Organisms organized into a population
			- All of the elk living in one area at a time
			- [[Intraspecies]] interactions
				- Involving members of one species [^1]
				- Could be [[bull elk]] or [[cow elk]]
				- This would be the emergent property of population
		- [[Community]]
			- All different populations interacting together
			- All [[biotic]] at this point. They're all living things. Interactions between different populations at level of community
				- [[Predation]]
				- [[competition]]
				- [[parasitism]]
		- [[Ecosystem]]
			- [[Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem]]
				- Determined boundary by wherever [[grizzly bears]] are found
			- Now adding [[abiotic]] materials. Water, chemistry, light for example
		- [[Biome]]
			- Ecosystems that have similar climates
			- Same [[temperature]] and same [[precipitation]] throughout the year
				- [[Tropical rain forest]]
				- [[Desert]]
				- [[northwestern coniferous forest]]
				- [[Tundra]]
				- [[Taiga]]
		- [[Biosphere]]
			- Wherever we find life on our planet
			- Deep in the ocean to high in the atmosphere
