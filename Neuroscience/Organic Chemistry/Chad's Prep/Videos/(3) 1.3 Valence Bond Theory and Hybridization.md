- Introduction to Valence Bond Theory and Atomic Orbitals
	- Talks about what creates a covalent bond
		- sharing of electrons
	- Atomic orbitals overlap (this is where the electrons will be shared)
	- Wave Functions ($\Psi$)

			- 1s orbital is spherical (solid sphere like a bowling ball (solid) not a basketball)
			- Gives idea where you can find electron around nucleus
				- nucleus is at center of sphere
				- Somewhere to that sphere (around 95% probability we're usually mapping), that's what the 3D equation would look like.

			- From left to right (x axis, y axis, z axis) are at the nucleus
				- all have a node right at the nucleus   
					- Has the node because function is going from positive to negative

						- Totally arbitrary whether the "+" and "-" is at the top or bottom
							- This is not charge, just mathematical sign (values) of the function itself
					- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 1.26.34 PM.png]]
						- Instead of doing "+" or "-", will just shade one side or the other
							- One does mean "+" and one means "-" but it's arbitrary which is which.
			- 2p orbitals are dumbbell shaped
			- There is a node at the nucleus (where the line crosses)
				- Node is a place where the function goes to 0

					- If you remember <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">sin</mark> and <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">cos</mark> functions, they also had nodes. <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Sin</mark> function had nodes at all the multiples of $\pi$ which is where the function has a value of 0. Those were 2D wave equations
					- Can be positive and negative
						- every time you cross from positive through negative, you must cross through 0 which is your node
				- The orbitals are 3D wave equations
					- Describes where you find an electron in an atom 
		- If you went to 2s or 3p higher orders, you would find them bigger but also have radial nodes (Areas at a set radius around the nucleus where you won't find electrons)
		- Higher order shells are larger and form longer bonds which are weaker
- Sigma overlap and sigma bonds
	- The heart of valence bond theory is overlapping orbitals to create these covalent bonds 
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 3.47.27 PM.png]] $\ce{H2}$ represents covalent bond
		- Hydrogen has its unpaired electron (its only electron) in an s orbital
		- the s orbitals will come together and overlap according to valence bond theory
			- in the overlapping orbitals is where the electrons are going to live that are being shared (the ones described in the line representing the covalent bond)
			- We call this a sigma $\sigma$ overlap (pi overlap later?)
	- $\ce{H-F}$
