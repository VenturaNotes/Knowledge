- Organic chemistry is the study of molecules in living systems
	- The study of carbon-containing compounds
	- Won't talk about transition metals
	- It is taught differently depending on the university / professor
	- Life is very complex so might be taught more trends than real-world results
		- To attempt to make absolute rules
- Inorganic chemistry deals with the rest of the elements than just carbon
- Lewis structures is a review of general chemistry
- In a Lewis structure, we put valence electrons on there

	- how to identify how many valence electrons an element has based on where it is on the periodic table
	- Group 1 elements hydrogen on down have 1 valence electron
	- Group 2 elements beryllium on down have 2 valence electrons
	- Borons Column 3 on down have 3 valence electrons
		- 3 bonds (not 5 bonds because it's a violation of the octet rule)
	- Carbon column have 4 valence electrons
		- We can determine carbon makes 4 bonds from this information
	- Nitrogen column has 5 valence electrons
		- 3 bonds
	- Oxygen column has 6 valence electrons
		- 2 short of a filled octet (2 bonds)
	- The Halogens in column 7 has 7 valence electrons
		- 1 short of a filled octet (typically see them making 1 bond)
	- Noble gases (helium on down) have 8 valence electrons (don't care too much about them since not any bonding will happen with them in this chapter)
	- Can base how many bonds an atom is typically going to make (determined by valence electrons)
		- Not absolute such as carbon having more bonds than its typical number of 4
	- You look at how many electrons is an atom short from getting a filled octet (usually typical number of bonds)
- Octet Rule 
	- Most atoms are struggling in their existence to have 8 valence electrons
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 10.23.53 AM.png|300]]
		- S and P are both subshells
		- S has 1 orbital and P has 3 orbitals
		- Electrons can live in the orbitals (2 electrons per orbital in universe)
		- Above shows 8 electrons in typical shell
			- Carbon shoots for 8 electrons
			- Boron is an exception in octet rule
			- Larger elements on right side of periodic table can go over octet rule
	- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">Exceptions to the Octet Rule</mark>
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">1) Third row and lower can exceed the octet rule</mark>
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 10.30.18 AM.png|300]]
				- Contains a `d` subshell.  Can put up to 10 more electrons in if you want to
				- Will start having a `d` subshell in the 3rd shell or above (corresponds to elements in the 3 period and below on periodic table. Allowed to go over but don't have to)
				- Most chemistry we'll study deals with carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen
				- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 10.36.01 AM.png]]
					- Inorganic reagent such as sulfuric acid
					- Sulfur ends up with 12 electrons around it (way over octet rule)
					- Sulfur is not always going to violate the octet rule (doesn't have to but has the option)
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">2) H only 2, Be only 4, B and Al only 6 (usually)</mark>
			- Hydrogen only has the first shell "s"
				- It wants 2 electrons and not 8 (goes commonly under the octet rule)
			- Beryllium is more often a metal than a nonmetal 
				- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 10.39.49 AM.png]] $\ce{BeH2}$
				- Won't make covalent bonds too often
				- Only has 2 valence electrons
				- Makes 2 bonds (4 electrons around it total. Under octet rule)
				- Same thing for Boron and aluminum (6 electrons usually)
					- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 10.40.39 AM.png]]$BH_3$ 
						- Boron with 3 valence electrons can only share with 3 different atoms to make 3 bonds (6 electrons total)
						- Boron can end up with 4 bonds (end up with a filled octet)
						- More typical for Boron to end up with 6 electrons and not 8 (goes under octet rule)
		- <mark style="background: #FFF3A3A6;">3) Molecules with odd numbers of electrons</mark>
			- Not too relevant to organic chemistry
			- If you have a species like $\ce{NO}$ which has an odd # of valence electrons, one of them will have an odd # which is not 8
			- Won't encounter this in organic chemistry (super unlikely)
	- How to get a filled octet? (ionic and covalent bonding in Lewis Structures)
		- One way is a metal and a nonmetal
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 10.48.44 AM.png]]
				- Na (sodium) is a metal and Cl (chlorine) is a nonmetal
				- Na has 1 valence electron and Cl has 7 valence electrons
		- When you have a metal and a nonmetal, nonmetals like to gain electrons. Metals have low ionization energy and are the easiest to move electrons from. 
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 10.50.55 AM.png]]
			- "Na" transfers its valence electron to "Cl"
			- "Cl" will now have 8 valence electrons
				- Chlorine now has a negative formal charge
			- "Na" has a positive charge
			- "Cl" and "Na" are now ionically bonded together
				- Won't deal with ionic bonds much in this course (mostly covalent bonds)
			- With ionic bonds, get complete transfer of electrons
			- "Na" has a complete second shell that's full meaning it has a filled octet as well
			- By transfer of electrons between metal and nonmetal gives filled octet
		- Two nonmetals
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 10.54.48 AM.png]]
			- "Cl" and "Cl" are both elements that want to gain an electron
				- They both have high ionization energy
			- No transfer of electrons (but they can share)
				- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 10.59.06 AM.png]]
				- Represent covalent bond as a line for shared electrons
				- The 2 shared electrons are a covalent bond
				- Both "Cl" get to count the shared electron as part of their octet
					- Sharing accomplishes getting a filled octet
			- Will be dealing with nonmetals most of the time in organic chemistry
				- deal more with sharing electrons than transferring 
- Examples of How to Draw Lewis Structures
	- Steps
		- 1) How many valence electrons your working with
		- 2) Find your central atom
			- The one that can make the most bonds
			- Can have more than 1
			- Set up skeleton for molecule and connecting atoms with single bonds
			- Bonds (least electronegative atom becomes central atom except hydrogen)
				- Halogens make 1 bond
				- Oxygen column 2 bonds
				- Nitrogen column 3 bonds
				- Carbon column 4 bonds
				- Boron column 3 bonds
				- Hydrogen column 1 bond
			- Hydrogen is less electronegative than carbon but carbon makes more bonds
			- Least electronegative atom will be the central atom (just not hydrogen)
			- An atom's electronegativity is affected by both its atomic number and the distance at which its valence electrons reside from the charged nucleus. [^1]

		- 3) Next you'll fill out the outside atoms
	- $\ce{CH4}$ (Methane)
		- Structure
			- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 11.21.06 AM.png]]
		- The hydrogens don't want a filled octet, just want 2 electrons to look like Helium
		- hydrogens are full
		- Any electrons left over will go on central atom after outside atoms
		- The central atom is satisfied because it has 8 electrons so satisfied the octet rule
		- Steps
			- Figure out valence electrons
			- Figure out which atom goes in the middle and set up skeleton
			- Fill up outside atoms first and any additional electrons give to central atom
	- $\ce{NH3}$ (ammonia)
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 11.50.14 AM.png]]
		- Nitrogen has 5 valence electrons
		- Each hydrogen has 1 valence electrons (so 3)
		- Nitrogen being the least electronegative (besides hydrogen) goes in the middle since it can make the most bonds
		- 2 electrons left for central atom (put it in pairs of central atom)
		- Central atom is satisfied (filled octet)
	- $\ce{H2CO}$
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 11.52.16 AM.png]]
		- Carbon has 4 valence, Oxygen has 6 valence, H has 2 valence
		- Carbon is the least electronegative (besides hydrogen) so carbon will be in center
		- Carbon needs double bond to be satisfied with 8 valence electrons. Carbon will double bond to oxygen
	- $\ce{CH3CHO}$ (Acetaldehyde - an aldehyde) (need to memorize what this lewis structure looks like) (condensed formula)
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 11.56.36 AM.png]]
		- When putting carbon followed by hydrogens, the hydrogens will be bonded to that carbon (helps set up skeleton)
		- 18 valence electrons (added together from periodic table)
		- Both carbons are central atoms
	- $\ce{CH3COOH}$  (acetic acid - main non-water component in vinegar - carboxylic acid)
		- Count valence electrons (24)
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 12.30.09 PM.png]]
			- The carbon could share the bond with either oxygen, but one is better than the other in terms of formal charge
			- Oxygen likes to make 2 bonds. Since the rightmost oxygen atom is already making 2 bonds, there should be a shared bond between the carbon atom and the oxygen atom above
			- If you can make a structure where every atom has a typical number of bonds, this kind of structure will be better
			- Need to recognize that $\ce{COOH}$ makes that kind of lewis structure
		- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 11.59.22 AM.png]] (WRONG)
			- This comes down to a problem in formal charge 
			- Makes it a very unlikely structure to exist
			- Got atoms in structure that are not making their typical number of bonds
				- Means they have a formal charge with greater instability
			- Carbon with 4 valence electrons makes 4 bonds  (but the carbon here is making 3)
			- Oxygen with 6 valence electrons typically makes 2 bonds (but the oxygen here is making 3
			- Not the best structure we can come up with for the molecule
