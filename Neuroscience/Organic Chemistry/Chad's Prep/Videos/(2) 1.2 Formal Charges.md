- Introductory Remarks
	- This first chapter is all a review of general chemistry
- Introduction to Formal Charges
	- Formal charges and oxidation states are not the same thing
	- When an atom makes a normal number of bonds, it will not have a formal charge (0)
	- When an atom makes something other than its typical # of bonds, almost always it will have a formal charge

		- Carbon wants to make 4 bonds. Both are satisfied above so no formal charge
		- Oxygen only has 1 bond when it wants 2 so it should have a formal charge here
			- $6 - (\frac{1}{2}(2) + 6)=-1$
				- Oxygen has 6 normal valence electrons
				- There are 2 bonding electrons
				- There are 6 nonbonding electrons
				- Put minus sign to show negative formal charge
			- 6 normal valence electrons - (6 dots + 1 line) = -1
		- None other atoms have formal charge
		- Atypical # of bonds means formal charge
- How to calculate formal charge
	- Formal charge = 
		- Normal valence $e^-$ $-$ (1/2 bonding electrons + nonbonding electrons)
		- or
		- Normal Valence $e^-$ $-$ ("dots + lines")

		- Nitrogen should make 3 bonds.
			- 5 - (0 + 4) = 1
	- ![[Screenshot 2022-12-09 at 12.58.00 PM.png]] $\ce{AlCl4}$
		- Aluminum usually has 6 electrons around it (not 8)
		- expected 3 bonds but has 4
			- 3 - (0 + 4) = -1
			- Has a negative charge
	- Have to be able to assign formal charges and do it quickly for first exam in organic chemistry$
