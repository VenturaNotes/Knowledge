	- [[Membrane voltage|Membrane potential]] refers to the difference in electrical charge between the inside and the outside of a neuron.
		- The plasma or [[cell membranes|cell membrane]] of a neuron separates the inside of the cell from the outside environment. 
	- The difference of electrical charge develops due to the grouping of ions on the inside and outside of the membrane
		- Ions are atoms that have either lost or gained electrons and thus have a positive or negative charge
		- Several ions that play important role in membrane potential of neurons
			- There are positively charged sodium (Na+) ions (represented by blue circles) and negatively charged chloride (Cl-) ions (represented by green circles)
			- When a neuron is at rest, the sodium ions and chloride ions are more prevalent outside of the cell
			- There are positively charged potassium (k+) ions (represented by yellow circles) and various negatively charged ions, often referred to as organic anions (-) (represented by gray circles)
				- [[Anion]] is simply a term for a negatively charged ion
		- When a neuron is at rest, the potassium ions and organic anions are more prevalent inside the cell
			- At rest, the inside of the neuron is more negatively charged than the outside causing the resting membrane potential of an average neuron to be around -70 millivolts
	- One way this potential is maintained is through a mechanism known as the sodium-potassium pump
		- It's a transport protein that uses energy to constantly pump three sodium ions out of the cell while at the same time pumping two potassium ions into the cell
		- Since there are more positive ions being pumped out than in, it helps to keep the membrane potential negative
		- Unlike other ions, potassium tends to move fairly easily across the cell membrane through ion channels, which are membrane spanning proteins that allow ions to pass through
			- Potassium will pass out of the neuron until it reaches the point where it is at an equilibrium - when forces like diffusion aren't pushing it in one direction or the other.
			- At this point, the membrane potential of the neuron is -65 to -70 mV, which is known as the [[resting membrane potential]]
