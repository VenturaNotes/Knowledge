	- The primary visual cortex, also known as V1, is a brain region that is critically important for the processing of visual information. It is found in the occipital lobe, surrounding and extending into a sulcus called the calcarine sulcus. A large band of myelinated axons runs along the edges of the calcarine sulcus, giving the primary visual cortex a striped appearance. Because of this, it is sometimes called the striate cortex. 
	- Most of the visual information that leaves the retina is sent to a nucleus in the thalamus called the lateral geniculate nucleus. From there it is sent back to the primary visual cortex via large bundles of axons called the optic radiations. 
	- Neurons in the primary visual cortex are arranged into columns that preferentially respond to certain characteristics of visual stimuli, such as location, orientation, and which eye the information is coming from. For example, neurons in one column might respond primarily to stimuli that have a certain orientation (such as upright or horizontal) and are perceived by the right eye, while neurons in another column might respond primarily to a different orientation, and only when the information is coming from the left eye. These columns of neurons are themselves collected into assemblies called modules; each module contains an array of columns necessary to analyze one small area of the visual field. Thus, to construct the visual scene, the primary visual cortex contains many of these modules. 
	- Through activation of these specialized neurons, the primary visual cortex helps to identify basic features of a visual stimulus. But it also communicates with surrounding visual areas, which are sometimes collectively referred to as the extrastriate cortex, to process additional aspects of the visual scene. Then, these visual areas project to various other brain regions for further processing and the incorporation of related functions, such as attention and memory.
