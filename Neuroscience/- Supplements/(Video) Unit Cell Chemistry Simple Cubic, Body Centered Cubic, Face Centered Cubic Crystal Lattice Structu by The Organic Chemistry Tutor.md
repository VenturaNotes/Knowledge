	- Each cube represents a single [[unit cell]]
		- [[Simple Cubic]]
			- In one unit cell is 1 atom
			- [[Coordination]] is 6
				- coordination number is number of atoms that's attached to a single atom
					- Meaning every atom in this cubic structure is attached or adjacent to six other atoms
			- 52% of volume of cube actually consists of volume of atoms
				- Meaning 48% is empty space
			- Edge length (commonly the side length of a cube represented by "x")
				- "r" is the radius
				- Need to know relationship between edge length and radius (atomic radius) of atoms in each of these structures
			- $x = 2R$
				- Edge length is twice the value of the atomic radius of atoms in structure
		- [[Body Centered Cubic]]
			- 2 atoms per unit cell
			- Coordination is 8 (atom in middle is attached to 8 other atoms)
			- 68% volume (68% efficient)
				- 32% unused space
			- $x = \frac {4}{\sqrt{3}}R$
				- If given density of element, and we want to find edge length or atomic radius of element. They'll have to specify which structure we're dealing with.
		- [[Face Centered Cubic]]
			- 4 atoms per unit cell
			- Coordination is 12
			- 74% volume
				- Most efficient cubic structure
			- $x = \sqrt{8}R$

	- Simple Cubic
		- Why is it 1 atom per unit cell?
			- 8 atoms that's at the edge of the cube
				- Each atom at edge is $\frac {1}{8}$ of an atom.
				- $\frac 18 (8) = 1$ 
					- This is why there is only 1 atom per unit cell in a simple cubic structure
		- Why is coordination 6?
			- Every atom is surrounded by 6 other atoms
		- Why 52% volume?
			- Volume of a spherical atom $\frac 43 \pi r^3$

	- Body Centered cubic
		- Why is it 2 atom per unit cell?
			- This is because there are $\frac 18$ of 8 atoms on each corner and 1 whole atom in the center
		- Why is coordination number 8
			- Atom in middle is attached to 8 other atoms
		- Deriving edge length to the atomic radius of atoms in body centered cubic structure

		- Why volume 68%?
