## Preface
### The Origins of Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
- “the course does not survey all of neurobiology. Instead, the focus is on mammalian brains and, whenever possible, the human brain.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=9&annotation=GUYBLVM9))
- “the course closely resembles what is taught to most beginning medical students.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=9&annotation=J6GGSBKP))
### New in the Fourth Edition
- “We now have insight into how neurons differ at the molecular level” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=9&annotation=UJVD2BSV))
- “The methods of [[genetic engineering]] have made it possible to create animal models to examine how genes and genetically defined circuits contribute to brain function.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=9&annotation=9UQG2RP7))
	- “[[Skin cells]] derived from patients been transformed into [[stem cells]], and these have been transformed into [[neurons]] that reveal how [[cellular functions]] go awry in diseases and how the brain might be repaired.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=10&annotation=VEGNT7TQ))
- "Wiring diagram" for entire brain may be possible
- “A unique feature of our book is the Path of Discovery boxes, in which famous neuroscientists tell stories about their own research.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=10&annotation=KKZVBLMY))
### An Overview of the Book
- “surveys the organization and function of the human nervous system.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=10&annotation=B332PTFG))
- “The human nervous system is examined at several different scales, ranging from the molecules that determine the functional properties of neurons to the large systems in the brain that underlie cognition and behavior.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=10&annotation=HM9KN2Z4))

## (I) - Part One: Foundations
## (1) Neuroscience - Past, Present, and Future
### Introduction
- “The neuroscience revolution occurred when scientists realized that the best hope for understanding the workings of the brain would come from an interdisciplinary approach, a combination of traditional approaches to yield a new synthesis, a new perspective.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=48&annotation=H5Q7N9UL))
	- This can include scientific disciplines such as “medicine, biology, psychology, physics, chemistry, mathematics.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=48&annotation=9JG375N6))

### (1.1) The Origins of Neuroscience
- “You probably already know that the [[nervous system]]—the [[brain]], [[spinal cord]], and [[Nerve|nerves]] of the body—is crucial for life and enables you to sense, move, and think.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=48&annotation=2FC2FMJM))
- Hominids back a million years damaged each other's skulls indicating they knew how much the brain was vital to life
- “As early as 7000 years ago, people were boring holes in each other’s skulls (a process called” [[trepanation]]), evidently with the aim not to kill but to cure” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=48&annotation=E73QCJ3F))
	- “procedure may have been used to treat headaches or mental disorders, perhaps by giving the evil spirits an escape route.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=49&annotation=PYBHXZE4))
- “The view that the heart was the seat of consciousness and thought was not seriously challenged until the time of Hippocrates.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=49&annotation=XGCFY5QZ))
	- physicians of ancient Egypt over 5000 years ago were away of symptoms of brain damage
#### Views of the Brain in Ancient Greece
- Structure of feet and hands different because they perform different functions. Therefore, there is a correlation between structure and function. Differences in appearance predict differences in function
- “head is specialized for sensing the environment with the eyes and ears, nose, and tongue.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=49&annotation=8W8BXBVY))
	- “Even crude dissection can trace the nerves from these organs through the skull into the brain.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=49&annotation=FX7MKLNF))
- “brain is the organ of sensation” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=49&annotation=WWQAVUSF))
- “The most influential scholar was [[Hippocrates]] (460–379 B.C.E.), the father of Western medicine, who believed that the brain was not only involved in sensation but was also the seat of intelligence.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=49&annotation=4VYCEMFK))
	- Not universally accepted however
- “The famous Greek philosopher [[Aristotle]] (384–322 B.C.E.) clung to the belief that the heart was the center of intellect” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=49&annotation=HXPT6V86))
	- Believed rational temperament of humans was explained by the large cooling capacity of our brain
	- Brain was radiator for cooling blood
#### Views of the Brain During the Roman Empire
- “The most important figure in Roman medicine was the Greek physician and writer [[Galen]] (130–200 C.E.), who embraced the Hippocratic view of brain function” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=49&annotation=N4NW36QV))
	- Did animal dissections (like sheep)
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-12 at 11.21.08 PM.png|500]] ^zp122j
	- Two major parts of brain
		- [[Cerebrum]] (in front)
			- Galen noticed
				- Soft
					- must receive sensations (recognized that to form memories, sensations must be imprinted in brain)
						- Correct general conclusion reached for wrong reasons
		- [[Cerebellum]] (in back)
			- Galen noticed
				- Hard
					- must command muscles
	- Cerebrum is in fact largely concerned with sensation and perception
		- Repository of memory
	- Cerebellum is primarily a movement control center
	- When Galen cut brain, found it was hollow
		- “In these hollow spaces, called [[Ventricle|ventricles]] (like the similar chambers in the heart), there is fluid” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=50&annotation=E9C9I4XL))
		- “body functioned according to a balance of four vital fluids, or [[humors]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=50&annotation=7J6DL27R))
			- “Sensations were registered and movements initiated by the movement of humors to or from the brain ventricles via the nerves, which were believed to be hollow tubes, like the blood vessels.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=50&annotation=7LLB4NSY))
#### Views of the Brain from the Renaissance to the Nineteenth Century
- “[[Galen|Galen's]] view of the brain prevailed for almost 1500 years.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=50&annotation=CSRF34QF))
- “During the [[Renaissance]], the great [[anatomist]] [[Andreas Vesalius]] (1514–1564) added more detail to the structure of the brain” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=50&annotation=BE6RKPJV))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-12 at 11.33.35 PM.png]]
	- “[[ventricular theory of brain function]] remained essentially unchallenged.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=50&annotation=S7N78NAB))
	- When French inventors built hydraulically controlled mechanical devices, brain could be machinelike in function: Fluid forced out of ventricles to cause movement of limbs 
	- Drawing by [[Descartes]]
		- Thought hollow nerves from eyes projected to the brain ventricles. Mind influenced the motor response by controlling pineal gland (worked like a valve to control movement of animal spirits through nerves that inflated the muscles.)
	- “A chief advocate of this [[fluid–mechanical theory of brain function]] was the French mathematician and philosopher [[René Descartes]] (1596–1650).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=51&annotation=KG8ZP2WW))
		- “Descartes believed it could not possibly account for the full range of human behavior.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=51&annotation=M3H8G7LV))
			- “people possess intellect and a God-given soul.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=51&annotation=X3SUEPLB))
			- so brain mechanisms control human behavior that of beasts
			- “human mental capabilities exist outside the brain in the “mind.”” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=51&annotation=96LXBPI9))
				- Mind is a spiritual entity
					- Communicates with machinery of brain via [[pineal gland]] (1.5)
- According to neuroscience, “The mind has a physical basis, which is the brain” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=51&annotation=3GBDS49F))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-13 at 12.17.17 AM.png|200]]
	- Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries
		- Two types of brain tissue
			- [[Gray matter]]
			- [[White matter]]
				- Since it's continuous with nerves of body, correctly believed to contain fibers that bring information to and from the gray matter
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-13 at 12.23.11 AM.png]] ^7cunf7
	- Description
		- [[Nervous system]] consists of two divisions
			- [[central nervous system]]
				- Brain
					- Cerebrum
					- Cerebellum
					- [[Brain stem]]
				- Spinal cord
			- [[peripheral nervous system]]
				- Nerves and nerve cell that lie outside brain and spinal cord
		- Lobes of cerebrum
			- [[Sylvian fissure]]
				- divides [[frontal lobe]] from [[temporal lobe]]
			- [[Central sulcus]]
				- Divides frontal lobe from [[parietal lobe]]
			- [[Occipital lobe]] at back of brain
		- Landmarks con be found on all human brains
		- Cerebellum included
	- By end of eighteenth century, scientists recognized that nervous system has a central division
		- consists of brain, spinal cord, and a peripheral division, consisting of network of nerves coursing through the body
	- Breakthrough in [[neuroanatomy]] came with observation that general pattern of bumps ([[gyri]]) and grooves (called [[sulci]] and [[fissures]]) can be identified on surface of brain on every individual
		- Enables parceling of the [[cerebrum]] into [[lobes]]. Lead to speculation that different functions might be localized to the different bumps on the brain
			- Stage now set for era of [[cerebral localization]]
#### Nineteenth-Century Views of the Brain
- Nervous system understanding at end of eighteenth century (1700s)
	- Injury to brain disrupts sensations, movement, thought, potentially leading to death
	- Brain communicates with body via nerves
	- Brain has different identifiable parts which probably performs different functions
	- Brain operates like machine and follows laws of nature
- 4 key insights gained during nineteenth century
##### Nerves as Wires
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-13 at 12.41.32 AM.png|500]]
	- Parts shown
		- [[Spinal cord]]
		- [[Ventral root|Ventral roots]]
		- [[Dorsal root|Dorsal roots]]
		- [[Nerve]]
		- [[Muscle]]
		- [[Skin]]
		- [[Nerve fibers]] (axons)
		- [[Vertebra]]
		- Figure 1.9 ([[Spinal Nerve|Spinal nerves]] and [[Spinal Nerve Root|spinal nerve roots]])
			- 31 pairs of nerves leave the spinal cord to supply the skin and muscles
			- Cutting a spinal nerve leads to a loss of sensation and a loss of movement in affected region of body
				- Incoming [[sensory fibers]] (red) and outgoing [[motor fibers]] (blue) divide into [[Spinal Root|spinal roots]] where the nerves attach to the spinal cord.
				- Bell and Magendie found that [[Ventral Root|ventral roots]] contain only motor fibers and [[Dorsal Root|dorsal roots]] contain only sensory fibers ^38z2c6
	- [[Luigi Galvani]] and [[Emil du Bois-Reymond]] found muscles twitch when nerves stimulated electrically and brain can generate electricity
		- New concept now that nerves are "wires" that conduct electrical signals to and from brain
	- Are same wires used for muscles and skin?
		- Bidirectional communication suggested
		- “many thin filaments, or [[nerve fibers]], each one of which could serve as an individual wire carrying information in a different direction.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=53&annotation=LK4S7F49))
		- Answered around 1810 by [[Charles Bell]] and [[François Magendie]]
			- Anatomical fact
				- Before nerves attach to spinal cord, [[Fiber|fibers]] divide into two branches/roots
					- [[Dorsal Root|Dorsal root]] enters toward back of spinal cord ^ak17yk
					- [[Ventral Root|Ventral root]] enters toward front of spinal cord ^zwj6i4
				- Bell cut each root separately (observed consequences in experimental animals)
					- Cutting ventral roots caused [[muscle paralysis]]
				- Magendie showed that dorsal roots carry [[sensory information]] into the spinal cord
				- They concluded that within each nerve is a mixture of many wires
					- some bring information into the brain and spinal cord
					- Others send information out to the muscles
		- In each [[sensory nerve fiber]] and [[motor nerve fiber]], transmission is strictly one-way
			- These fibers are bundled together for most of their length, but they are anatomically segregated where the enter or exit the spinal cord
##### Localization of Specific Functions to Different Parts of the Brain
- Different functions localized in different roots and maybe parts of brain
	- In 1811, Bell proposed origin of motor fibers is the cerebellum and destination of sensory fibers is the cerebrum
- “This approach, in which parts of the brain are systematically destroyed to determine their function, is called the [[experimental ablation method]]” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=54&annotation=ZI7SNIXE))
	- On birds, [[Marie-Jean-Pierre Flourens]] showed cerebellum does play role in coordination of movement and cerebrum is involved in sensation and perception
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-13 at 8.04.51 PM.png|200]]
	- [[Franz Joseph Gall]]
		- Propensity for certain personality traits related to dimensions of head (bumps on skull reflect bumps on brain)
			- Traits related to size of different parts of skull
		- “This new “science” of correlating the structure of the head with personality traits was called [[phrenology]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=54&annotation=AGENLY8K))
			- Never taken seriously by scientific community
- Flourens
	- Against phrenology
	- “shape of the skull is not correlated with the shape of the brain” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=54&annotation=BURQD8WW))
	- Incorrect about how “all regions of the cerebrum participate equally in all cerebral functions” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=54&annotation=AFZJCGSV))
		- Absolutely hated Gall which may be why he thought this
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-13 at 8.16.38 PM.png|400]]
	- [[Paul Broca]]
		- Helped claim localization of functions in cerebrum
		- Had a patient who understood language but couldn't speak
			- After patient's death, found a lesion in left [[frontal lobe]]
				- Concluded that was region of human cerebrum responsible for production of speech
- [[Gustav Fritsch]] and [[Eduard Hitzig]]
	- “applying small electrical currents to a circumscribed region of the exposed surface of the brain of a dog could elicit discrete movements.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=54&annotation=QD7DXTRQ))
- “[[David Ferrier]]” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=8X5ELJKD))
	- “repeated these experiments with monkeys” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=DVZ5CFA7))
	- “removal of this same region of the cerebrum causes paralysis of the muscles.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=J7TT647R))
- “German physiologist [[Hermann Munk]] using experimental ablation found evidence that the [[occipital lobe]] of the cerebrum was specifically required for vision.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=IY72XPJS))

##### The Evolution of Nervous Systems
- “[[Charles Darwin]]” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=NH8PKXHV))
	- “published On the Origin of Species.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=U8IS3N5Z))
		- “species of organisms evolved from a common ancestor.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=HHVS3WKI))
	- “differences among species arise by a process Darwin called [[natural selection]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=ENKHVX54))
	- “As a result of the mechanisms of reproduction, the physical traits of the offspring are sometimes different from those of the parents.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=LV53ECF3))
		- Advantage traits more likely to pass on to next generation
	- “Over the course of many generations, this process led to the development of traits that distinguish species today: flippers on harbor seals, paws on dogs, hands on raccoons, and so on.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=KJYXBT29))
		- “revolutionized biology” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=JHWD2E29))
	- “evolution by natural selection.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=VFWVUTY9))
	- “Darwin included behavior among the heritable traits that could evolve.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=DGDHKQYR))
		- “many mammalian species show the same reaction when frightened: The pupils of the eyes get bigger, the heart races, hairs stand on end.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=Z479YLV9))
			- “different species evolved from a common ancestor that possessed the same behavioral trait” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=55&annotation=XP2QGVFB))

##### Interpretation
- “Interpretations depend on the state of knowledge (or ignorance) at the time and on the scientist’s preconceived notions (or "mind set"” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=59&annotation=FVEIZLAI))
	- Subjective
##### Verification
- “Verification means that the observation is sufficiently robust that any competent scientist who precisely follows the protocols of the original observer can reproduce it.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=60&annotation=5MFEV5CX))

- “This chapter focuses on the structure of the different types of [[cells]] in the nervous system: [[neurons]] and [[glia]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=68&annotation=96JKBEHN))
- “Although there are approximately equal numbers of neurons and glia in the adult human brain (roughly 85 billion of each type), neurons are responsible for most of the unique functions of the brain.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=68&annotation=WD3AJBPW))
- “It is the [[neurons]] that sense changes in the environment, communicate these changes to other neurons, and command the body’s responses to these sensations.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=68&annotation=VLZXCRB5))
- “[[Glia]], or glial cells, contribute to brain function mainly by insulating, supporting, and nourishing neighboring neurons.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=68&annotation=SD2ULL35))
	- “Indeed, the term glia is derived from the Greek word for “glue,”” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=68&annotation=IVYV8QEX))
- “neurons perform most information processing in the brain,” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=68&annotation=QZZAQC4F))

### (2.1) The Neuron Doctrine
- “Most [[cells]] are in the range of 0.01–0.05 mm in diameter.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=68&annotation=3LLWEE25))
- “Units of Size in the Metric System” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=HCS84UIG))
	- kilometer: km = $10^3m$
		- About two-thirds a mile
	- meter: m = $1m$
		- About 3 feet
	- centimeter: cm = $10^{-2}m$
		- Thickness of your little finger
	- millimeter: mm = $10^{-3}m$
		- Thickness of your toenail
	- micrometer: $\micro$m = $10^{-6}m$
		- Near the limit of resolution for the [[light microscope]]
	- nanometer: nm = $10^{-9}$
		- Neal the limit of resolution for the [[electron microscope]]
- “Because neurons cannot be seen by the naked eye, cellular neuroscience could not progress before the development of the [[compound microscope]] in the late seventeenth century.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=68&annotation=UTN6LG8P))
	- “To observe brain tissue using a microscope, it was necessary to make very thin slices, ideally not much thicker than the diameter of the cells.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=68&annotation=2GKFD44Q))
		- “brain tissue has a consistency like a bowl of Jell-O: not firm enough to make thin slices.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=68&annotation=AWBQCWKL))
- “Early in the nineteenth century, scientists discovered how to harden, or “fix,” [[tissues]] by immersing them in [[formaldehyde]], and they developed a special device called a [[microtome]] to make very thin slices.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=BGUIKJ7A))
	- “These technical advances spawned the field of [[histology]], the microscopic study of the structure of tissues.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=7PVDWC48))
		- “The final breakthrough in [[neurohistology]] was the introduction of [[stains]] that selectively color some, but not all, parts of the cells in brain tissue.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=H3JHYJ5L))
		- “One stain still used today was introduced by the German neurologist [[Franz Nissl]] in the late nineteenth century.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=ZSUV3KER))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-14 at 12.22.26 AM.png]]
	- Description
		- Thin slice of brain tissue stained with cresyl violet, a [[Nissl stain]]. 
		- Clumps of deeply stained material around the cell nuclei are [[Nissl bodies]]
	- “Nissl showed that a class of basic dyes would stain the nuclei of all cells as well as clumps of material surrounding the nuclei of neurons (Figure 2.1)” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=5KMRHGJG))
		- “These clumps are called[[ Nissl bodies]], and the stain is known as the [[Nissl stain]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=N6Q5IK78))
			- The Nissl stain: “It distinguishes between neurons and glia, and it enables histologists to study the arrangement, or [[cytoarchitecture]], of neurons in different parts of the brain.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=BE4JLQAC))
				- “prefix `cyto`- is from the Greek word for “cell.”” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=6XNVWWK5))
				- “study of [[cytoarchitecture]] led to the realization that the brain consists of many specialized regions.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=YJG434FG))
					- Now we know each region performs a different function
#### The Golgi Stain
- “A Nissl-stained neuron looks like little more than a lump of [[protoplasm]] containing a [[nucleus]]” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=69&annotation=ENDZDRZZ))
	- “Neurons are much more than that, but how much more was not recognized before Italian histologist [[Camillo Golgi]] devised a new method” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=9IKVME6X))
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-14 at 12.27.05 AM.png|300]]
	- “In 1873, Golgi discovered that soaking brain tissue in a [[silver chromate solution]], now called the [[Golgi stain]], makes a small percentage of neurons become darkly colored in their entirety (Figure 2.3).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=QBCVEDWC))
		- “revealed that the [[neuronal cell body]], the region of the neuron around the nucleus that is shown with the Nissl stain, is actually only a small fraction of the total structure of the [[neuron]]” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=YTJ8C8W5))
			- “Notice in Figures 2.1 and 2.3 how different histological stains can provide strikingly different views of the same tissue.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=9SY69NZI))
- Neurohistology credo: ““The gain in brain is mainly in the stain.””
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-14 at 12.30.59 AM.png|200]]
	- “[[Golgi stain]] shows that neurons have at least two distinguishable parts: a central region that contains the cell nucleus and numerous thin tubes that radiate away from the central region.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=WF9IUBDN))
	- “The swollen region containing the cell nucleus has several names that are used interchangeably: cell body, [[Soma]] (plural: somata), and perikaryon (plural: perikarya).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=EB4S8UR5))
	- “The thin tubes that radiate from the [[soma]] are called [[Neurite|neurites]] and are of two types: [[Axon|axons]] and [[Dendrite|dendrites]] (Figure 2.4).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=CPPD6LF3))
- “cell body usually gives rise to a single axon.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=4Y4IWMJX))
	- “axon is of uniform diameter throughout its length, and any branches from it generally extend at right angles.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=UI27NM86))
	- “axons can extend over great distances in the body (a meter or more),” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=S5WGCE7C))
		- “axons must act like “wires” that carry the output of the neurons.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=ZJ3JGN4K))
	- “Dendrites, on the other hand, are rarely longer than 2 mm.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=CXYLT4QT))
		- “Many dendrites extend from the cell body and generally taper to a fine point.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=70&annotation=HZSFH637))
- “because [[Dendrite|dendrites]] come in contact with many axons, they must act as the antennae of the neuron to receive incoming signals, or input.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=6WZ8M4BZ))
#### Cajal's Contribution
- “. [[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]] was a skilled histologist and artist who learned about Golgi’s method in 1888” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=9U43VTZF))
-  ![[Screenshot 2023-08-14 at 12.35.50 AM.png|500]]
	- One of Cajal's many drawings of [[brain circuitry]]
		- “The letters label the different elements Cajal identified in an area of the human [[cerebral cortex]] that controls voluntary movement.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=3YHFLI5R))
	- “used the Golgi stain to work out the circuitry of many regions of the brain” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=YX5UCJYJ))
- “Curiously, Golgi and Cajal drew completely opposite conclusions about neurons.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=9NND3Y5B))
- Golgi's view
	- “neurites of different cells are fused together to form a continuous reticulum, or network, similar to the arteries and veins of the [[circulatory system]]” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=EHNUJRL8))
		- “According to this reticular theory, the brain is an exception to the [[cell theory]], which states that the individual cell is the elementary functional unit of all animal tissues.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=PGNZGFNR))
- Cajal's view
	- “neurites of different neurons are not continuous with each other and communicate by contact, not continuity.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=S7L6D5WX))
		- “This idea that cell theory also applies to neurons came to be known as the [[neuron doctrine]].” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=VZE5HI6Z))
		- “scientific evidence over the next 50 years strongly supported the neuron doctrine, but final proof had to wait for the [[electron microscope]] in the 1950s (Box 2.1).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=THHM6KS7))
			- “it was finally possible to show that the neurites of different neurons are not continuous with one another” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=4LJSJCEA))
			- “Thus, our starting point in the exploration of the brain must be the individual neuron.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=71&annotation=YGXMA8PS))
		- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-14 at 12.41.42 AM.png|300]]
			- Figure 2.7: Neurites in contact, not continuity
				- “These neurites were reconstructed from a series of images made using an electron microscope. The axon (colored yellow) is in contact with a dendrite (colored blue).” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=ZDNL6RA5))
##### Box 2.1 of Special Interest: Advances in Microscopy
- ![[Screenshot 2023-08-14 at 12.52.43 AM.png|450]]
- “The human eye can distinguish two points only if they are separated by more than about one-tenth of a millimeter” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=FJ7VMAE5))
- “The [[light microscope]], therefore, was a necessary development before neuronal structure could be studied.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=HYD6AW5C))
	- “limit of resolution is about 0.1 micrometers” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=SXQ5BHBS))
	- Space between neurons is only $0.02 \micro m$ so no wonder Golgi and Cajal disagreed about whether neurites were continuous from one cell to the next
	- “This question could not be answered until about 70 years ago when the [[electron microscope]] was developed and applied to biological specimens.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=FMPTM9QZ))
- “The electron microscope uses an electron beam instead of light to form images, dramatically increasing the resolving power.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=3NAB5IWG))
	- “limit of resolution for an electron microscope is about 0.1 nm—a million times better than the unaided eye and a thousand times better than a light microscope.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=8ZXFFW95))
	- “Our insights into the fine structure of the inside of neurons—the [[ultrastructure]]—have all come from electron microscopic examination of the brain.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=EC8WCDHG))
- “microscopes on the leading edge of technology use [[laser beams]] to illuminate tissue and computers to create digital images (Figure A)” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=XMBBWL39)
	- “introduce into neurons molecules that fluoresce when illuminated by laser light.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=9XL7C2SR))
	- “fluorescence is recorded by sensitive detectors, and the computer takes these data and reconstructs the image of the neuron.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=4G95K3G8))
	- “Unlike the traditional methods of light and electron microscopy, which require tissue fixation, these new techniques give neuroscientists the ability to peer into brain tissue that is still alive” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=7ZVM7BV5))
		- “allowed “super-resolution” imaging, breaking the limits imposed by traditional light microscopy to reveal structures as small as 20 nm across.” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=72&annotation=NSM5XZ4Y))

### (2.2) The Prototypical Neuron
- “the [[neuron]] (also called a nerve cell) consists of several parts: the [[soma]], the [[Dendrite|dendrites]], and the [[axon]]” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=73&annotation=A3KPZZ2J))
- “inside of the neuron is separated from the outside by the [[neuronal membrane]],” ([pdf](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/L52NKGDQ?page=73&annotation=RQ3LTI52))
